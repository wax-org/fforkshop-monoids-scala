                         THE PRIME OF LIFE

                It was, in truth, an eager youth
                         Who halted me one day.
                He gazed in bliss at me, and this
                         Is what he had to say:

                "Why, mazel tov, it's Asimov,
                         A blessing on your head!
                For many a year, I've lived in fear
                         That you were long since dead.

                Or if alive, one fifty-five
                         Cold years had passed you by,
                And left you weak, with poor physique,
                         Thin hair and rheumy eye.

                For sure enough, I've read your stuff
                         Since I was but a lad
                And couldn't spell or hardly tell
                         The good yarns from the bad.

                My father, too, was reading you
                         Before he met my Ma.
                For you he earned, once he had learned
                         About you from _his_ Pa.

                Since time began, you wondrous man,
                         My ansestors did love
                That s.f. dean and writing machine
                         The aged Asimov."

                I'd had my fill. I said: "Be still!
                         I've kept my old-time spark.
                My step is light, my eye is bright,
                         My hair is thick and dark."

                His smile, in brief, spelled disbelief,
                         So this is what I did;
                I scowled, you know, and with one blow,
                         I killed that rotten kid.

                                                1966


                Author's remark: "Mazel tov" is a Hebrew
                phrase  meaning "good fortune" and it is
                used  by Jews  as a  joyfyl  greeting on
                jubilant  occasions  - as a meeting with
                me should surely be.
