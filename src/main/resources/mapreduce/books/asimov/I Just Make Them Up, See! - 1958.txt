 I JUST MAKE THEM UP, SEE!

                Oh, Dr A.-
                Oh, Dr A.-
                There is something (don't go 'way)
                That I'd like to hear you say.
                Though I'd rather die
                Than try
                To pry,
                The fact, you'll find,
                Is that my mind
                Has evolved the jackpot question for today.

                I intend no cheap derision,
                So please answer with decision,
                And, discarding all your petty cautious fears,
                Tell the secret of your vision!
                How on earth
                Do you give birth
                To those crazy and impossible ideas?

                It is indigestion
                And a question
                Of the nightmare that results?
                Of your eyeballs whirling,
                Twirling,
                Fingers curling
                And unfurling
                While your blood beats maddened chimes
                As it keeps impassioned times
                With your thick, uneven pulse?

                It is _that_, you think, or liquor
                That brings on the wildness quicker?
                For a teeny
                Weeny
                Dry martiny
                May be just your private genie;
                Or perhaps those Tom and Jerries
                You will find the very
                Berries
                For inducing
                And unloosing
                That weird gimmick or that kicker;
                Or an awful
                Combination
                Of unlawful
                Stimulation,
                Marijuana plus tequilla,
                That will give you just that feel o'
                Things a-clicking
                And unsticking
                As you start for celebration
                To the crazy syncopation
                Of a brain a-tocking-ticking.

                Surely _something_, Dr A.,
                Makes you you fey
                And quite _outre_.
                Since I read you with devotion,
                Won't you give me just a notion
                Of that shrewdy pepper-up potion
                Out of which emerge your plots?
                That wild secret bubbly mixture
                That has made you such a fixture
                In most favoured s.f. spots -

                Now, Dr A.,
                Don't go away -

                Oh, Dr A.-

                Oh, Dr A.-
