{286236069 }{2855745116236069 "Trends" was not my first published story,
but my third. The first two, however, did not appear in Astound ing and
so I rarely count them. This was the very first story I sold to John
Campbell, and I became the youngest member of the "stable" of writers he
had already gathered around himself. Though others still younger came
his way later, I don't think that ev er in his career did he have an
acolyte less worldly and more naive than I was. I believe that amused
him and that it pleased him to have so excellent an opportunity to do a
bit of molding. At any rate, I have always thought that of all his
writers I was his favorite and that he spent more time and effort on me
than on anyone else. I believe it still shows. I have always been proud
that my first Astound-ing story appeared in the first issue of the
Golden Age, but I know very well that there was no con-necti on. In
fact, in the blaze of Van Vogt's lead story Black Destroyer, I doubt
that anyone noticed the twinkle of my own presence. IA }{286236069
}{2855745116889536 John Harman was sitting at his desk, brooding, when I
en-tered the office that day. It had become a common sight, by then, to
see him staring out at the Hudson, head in hand, a scowl contorting his
face all too common. It seemed unfair for the little bantam to be eating
his heart out like that day after day, when by rights he should have
been receiving the praise and adulation of the world. I flopped down
into a chair. "Did you see the editorial in today's Clarion,
boss?}{2855745116889536 "}{2855745116889536 He turned weary, bloodshot
eyes toward me. "No, I haven't. What do they say? Are they calling the
vengeance of God down upon me again?" His voice dripping with bitter
sarcasm. "They're 'going a little farther now, boss," I answered.
"Listen to this: "}{286236069 }{2855745116889536 Tomorrow is the day of
John Harman's attempt at profaning the heavens. Tomorrow, in defiance of
world opinion and world conscience, this man will defy God. "
It is not given to man to go wheresoever ambition and desire lead him. There are things forever denied him, and aspiri}{\fs28\insrsid6236069 n}{\fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536  g to the stars is one of these. Like Eve, John Harman wishes to eat of the forbidden fruit, and like Eve he will suffer due punishment therefor. \par "But
it is not enough, this mere talk. If we allow him thus to brook the
vengeance of God, the trespass is mankind's and not Harman's alone. In
allowing him to carry out his evil designs, we make ourselves accessory
to the crime, and Divine vengea nce will fall on all alike. "'It is,
therefore, essential that immediate steps be taken to prevent Harman
from taking off in his so-called rocket-ship tomorrow. The government in
refusing to take such steps may force violent action. If it will make no
move to confiscate the rocketship, or to imprison Harman, our enraged
citizenry may have to take matters into their own hands' " Harman sprang
from his seat in a rage and, snatching the paper from my hands, threw it
into the corner furiously. "It's an open call to a lynching," he raved.
"Look at this!" He cast five or six envelopes in my direction. One
glance sufficed to tell what they were. "More death threats?" I asked.
"Yes, exactly that. I've had to arrange for another increase in the
police patrol outside the building and for a motorcycle police escort
when I cross the river to the testing ground tomorrow." He marched up
and down the room with agitated stride. "I don't know what to do,
Clifford. I've worked on the Prome-theus almost ten years. I've slaved,
spent a fortune of money, given up all that makes life worth whileand
for what? So}{ 286236069 }{2855745116889536 that a bunch of fool
revivalists can whip up public sentiment against me until my very life
isn't safe." "You're in advance of the times, boss," I shrugged my
shoulders in a resigned gesture which made him whirl upon me in a fury.
"What do you mean }{2855745116889536
}{\fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536 in advance of the times'? This is 1973. The wo rld has been ready for space travel for half a century now. Fifty years ago, people were talking, dreaming of the day when man could free himself of Earth and plumb the depths of space. For fifty years, science has inched toward this goal, and now . . . n ow I finally have it, and be}{\fs28\insrsid6236069 hold! }{\fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536 you say the world is not ready for me." \par "The '20s and '30s were years of anarchy, decadence, and misrule, if you remember your history," I reminded him gently. "You cannot accept them as criteria." \par "I know, I know. You're  going to tell me of the First War of 1914, and the Second of 1940. It's an old story to me; my father fought in the Second and my grandfather in the First. Nevertheless, those were the days when science flourished. Men were not afraid then; somehow they d reamed and dared. There was no such thing as conversation when it came to matters mechanical and  scientific. No theory was too radical to advance, no discovery too revolutionary to publish. Today, dry rot has seized the world when a great vision, such as space travel, is hailed asdefiance
of God.' " His head sank slowly down, and he turned away to hide his
trembling lips and the tears in his eyes. Then he suddenly straightened
again, eyes blazing: "But I'll show them. I'm go-ing through with it, in
spite of Hell, Heaven and Earth. I've put too much into it to quit now."
"Take it easy, boss," I advised. "This isn't going to do you any good
tomorrow, when you get into that ship. Your chances of coming out alive
aren't too good now, so what will they be if you start out worn to
pieces with excitement and worry?" "You're right. Let's not think of it
any more. Where's Shel-ton?" "Over at the Institute arranging for the
special photographic plates to be sent us." "He's been gone a long time,
hasn't he?" "Not especially; but listen, boss, there's something wrong
with him. I don't like him." "Poppycock! He's been with me two years,
and I have no complaints." "All right." I spread my hands in
resignation. "If you won't listen to me, you won't. Just the same I
caught him reading one of those infernal pamphlets Otis Eldredge puts
out. You know the kind:
Beware, }{\fs28\insrsid6236069 O}{ \fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536  mankind, for judgment draws near. Punishment for your sins is at hand. Repent and be saved.' And all the rest of the time-honored junk." \par Harman snorted in disgust. "Cheap tub-thumping rivivalist! I suppose the world will never outgrow his type\emdash not while sufficient morons exist. Still you can't condemn Shelton just because he reads it. I've read them myself on occasion." \par "He says he picked it up on the sidewalk and read it inidle
curiosity,' but I'm pretty sure I saw him take it out of his wallet.
Besides, he goes to church every Sunday." "Is that a crime? Everyone
does, nowadays!" "Yes, but hot to the Twentieth Century Evangelical
Soci-ety. That's Eldredge's." That jolted Harman. Evidently, it was the
first he had heard of it. "Say, that is something, isn't it? We'll have
to keep an eye on him, then." But after that, things started to happen,
and we forgot all about Sheltonuntil it was too late. There was nothing
much left to do that last day before the test, and I wandered into the
next room, where I went over Harman's final report to the }{286236069
Institute. It was my job to cor}{2855745116889536 rect any errors or
mistakes that crept in, but I'm afraid I wasn't very thorough. To tell
the truth, I couldn't concen-trate. Every few minutes, I'd fall into a
brown study. It seemed queer, all this fuss over space travel. When
Har-man had first announced the approaching perfection of the
Prometheus, some six months before, scientific circles had been
jubilant. Of course, they were cautious in their state- ments and
qualified everything they said, but there was real enthusiasm. However,
the masses didn't take it that way. It seems strange, perhaps, to you of
the twenty-first century, but per- haps we should have expected it in
those days of '73. People weren't very progressive then. For years there
had been a swing toward religion, and when the churches came out
unanimously against Harman's rocketwell, there you were. At first, the
opposition confined itself to the churches and we thought it might play
itself out. But it didn't. The papers got hold of it, and literally
spread the gospel. Poor Harman}{286236069 }{2855745116889536 became an
anathema to the world in a remarkably short time, and then his troubles
began. He received death threats}{286236069 ,}{2855745116889536 and
warnings of divine ven-geance every day. He couldn't walk the streets in
safety. Dozens of sects, to none of which he belonged he was one of the
very rare free-thinkers of the day, which was another count against
himexcommunicated }{286236069 h}{2855745116889536 im and placed him un-
der special interdict. And, worst of all. Otis Eldredge and his
Evangelical Society began st}{286236069 ir}{2855745116889536

acter--}{286236069 o}{2855745116889536 ne of those geniuses, in their
way, that arise every so often Gifted with a golden to ngue and a
sulphurous vocabulary, he could fairly hyp-notize a crowd. Twenty
thousand people were so much putty in his hands, could he only bring
them within earshot. And for four months}{286236069 ,}{2855745116889536
he thund}{286236069 e}{2855745116889536 red a}{286236069
g}{2855745116889536 ainst Harman; for four months, a pouring stream of
denunciation rolled forth in ora-toric}{286236069 al frenzy. And for
four months, }{2855745116889536 the temper of the world rose. But Harman
was not to be daunted}{286236069 . }{2855745116889536 In his tiny,
five-foot-two body, he had enou}{286236069 g}{2855745116889536 h spirit
for five six-footers. The more the wolves howled, the firmer he held his
ground. With almost divinehis enemies said diabolicalobstinacy, he re
fused to yield an inch. Yet his outward firmness was to me, who knew
him, but an imperfect concealment of the great sorrow and bitter
disappointment within. The ring of the doorbell interrupted my thoughts
at that point and brought me to my feet in surprise. Visitors were very
few those days. I looked out the window and saw a tall, portly figure
talk-ing with Police Sergeant Cassidy. I recognized him at once as
Howard Winstead, head of the Institute. Harman was hurry- ing out to
greet him, and after a short exchange of phrases, the two entered the
office. I followed them in, being rather curious as to what could have
brought Winstead, who was more politician than scientist, here. Winstead
didn't seem very comfortable, at first; not his usual suave self. He
avoided Harman's eyes in an embar-rassed manner and mumbled }{286236069
a few conventionalities concern}{2855745116889536 ing the weather. Then
he came to the point with direct, undiplomatic bluntness. "John," he
said, "how about postponing the trial for a time?" "You really mean
abandoning it altogether, don't you? Well, I won't, and that's final."
Winstead lifted his hand. "Wait now, John, don't get excited. Let me
state my case. I know the Institute agreed to give you a free hand, and
I know that you paid at least half the expenses out of your own pocket,
butyou can't go through with it."

"Oh, can't I, though?" Harman snorted derisively. "Now listen, John, you
know your science, but you don't know your human nature and I do. This
is not the world of the
Mad Decades,' whether you realize it or not. There have been profound changes since 1940." He swung into what was evidently}{ \fs28\sub\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536 ,}{\fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536  a carefully prepared speech. \par "After the First World War, you know, the world as a who le swung away from religion and toward freedom from convention. People were disgusted and disillusioned, cynical and sophisticated. Eldredge calls themwicked
and sinful.' In spite of that, science flourished some say it always
fares best in such an unconventional period. From its standpoint it was
a
Golden Age.' \par "However, you know the political and economic history of the period. It was a time of political chaos and international anarchy; a suicidal, brainless, insane period\emdash and it culmi\-nated in the Sec ond World War. And just as the First War led to a period of sophistication, so the Second initiated a return to religion. \par "People were disgusted with theMad
Decades.' They had had enough of it, and feared, beyond all else, a
return to it. To remove that possibility,}{286236069 they put the ways
of those dec}{2855745116889536 ades behind them. Their motives, you see,
were understandable and laudable. All the freedom, all the
sophistication, all the lack of convention were goneswept away clean. We
are living now in a second Victorian age; and naturally so, be cause
human history goes by swings of the pendulum and this is the swing
toward religion and convention. "One thing only is left over since those
days of half a cen-tury ago. That one thing is respect of humanity for
science. We have prohibition; smoking for women is outlawed; cos- metics
are forbidden; low dresses and short skirts are unheard of; divorce is
frowned upon. But science has not been con-finedas yet. "It behooves
science, then, to be circumspect, to refrain from arousing the people.
It will be very easy to make them believeand Otis Eldredge has come
perilously close to do-ing it in some of his speeches that it was
science that brought about the horrors of the Second World War.
Science}{286236069 }{2855745116889536 outstripped culture, they will
say, technology outstripped soci- ology, and it was that unbalance that
came so near to destroying the world. Somehow, I am inclined to believe
they are not so far wrong, at that. "But do you know what would happen,
if it ever did come to that? Scientific res earch may be forbidden or,
if they don't go that far, it will certainly be so strictly regulated as
to stifle in its own decay. It will be a calamity from which humanity
would not recover for a millennium. "And it is your trial flight that
may precipitate all this. You are arousing the public to a stage where
it will be diffi-cult to calm them. I warn you, John. The consequences
will be on your head." There was absolute silence for a moment and then
Harman forced a smile. "Come, Howard, you're letting your self be
frightened by shadows on the wall. Are you trying to tell me that it is
your serious belief that the world as a whole is ready to plunge into a
second Dark Ages? After all, the intel-ligent men are on the side of
science, aren't they?" "If they are, there aren't many of them left from
what I see." Winstead drew a pipe from his pocket and filled it slowly
with tobacco as he continued: "Eldridge formed a League of the Righteous
two months agothey call it the L. R. and it has grown unbelievably.
Twent y million is its membership in the United States alone. Eldredge
boasts that after the next election Congress will be his; and there
seems to be more truth than bluff in that. Already there has been
strenuous lobbying in favor of a bill outlawing rocket e xperi-ments,
and laws of that type have been enacted in Poland, Portugal, and
Rumania. Yes, John, we are perilously close to open persecution of
science." He was smoking now in rapid, nervous puffs. "But if I succeed,
Howard, if I succeed! What then?" }{2855745116889536 "}{2855745116889536
Bah! You know the chances for that. Your own estimate gives you only one
chance in ten of coming out alive." }{2855745116889536
"}{2855745116889536 What does that signify? The next experimenter will
learn by my mistakes, and the odds will improve. That's the scien-tific
method." "The mob doesn't know anything about the scientific method; and
they don't want to know. Well, what do you say? Will you call it off?"
}2840-1506-1506006236069 {2855745116889536 Harman sprang to his feet,
his chair tumbling over with a crash. "Do you know what you ask? Do you
want me to give}{ 286236069 }{2855745116889536 up my life's work, my
dream, just like that? Do you think I'm going to sit back and wait for

world, in interfering with me, is wrong; I am right. And it shall go
hard, but I will not abandon my rights." Winstead shook his head
sorrowfully. "You're wrong, John, when you speak of
inalienable' rights. What you call aright' is merely a privilege,
generally agreed upon. What society ac-cepts, is right; what it does
not, is wrong." "Would your friend, Eldredge, agree to such a definition
of his
righteousness'?" questioned Harmon bitterly. \par "No, he would not, but that's irrelevant. Take the case of those African tribes who used to be cannibals. They were brought up as cannibals, have}{\fs28\insrsid6236069  the long tradition of cannibal}{\fs28\insrsid5574511\charrsid6889536  ism, and their society accepts the practice. To them, cannibalism is right, and why shouldn't it be? So you see how relative the whole notion is, and how inane your conception ofinalienable'
rights to perform experiments is." "You know, Howard, you missed your
calling when you didn't become a lawyer." Harman was really growing
angry. "You've been bringing out every moth-eaten argument you can think
of. For God's sake, man, are you trying to pretend that it is a crime to
refuse to run with the crowd? Do you stand for absolute uniformity,
ordinariness, orthodoxy, com- monplaceness? Science would die far sooner
under the program you outline than under governmental prohibition."
Harman stood up and pointed an accusing finger at the other. "You're
betraying science and the tradition of those glorious rebels: Galileo,
Darwin, Einstein and their kind. My rocket leaves tomorrow on schedule
in spite of you and every other stuffed shirt in the United States.
That's that, and I refuse to listen to you any longer. So you can just
get out." The head of the Institute, red in the face, turned to me.
"You're my witness, young man, that I warned this obstinate nitwit, this
. . . this hare-brained fanatic." He spluttered a bit, and then strode
out, the picture of fiery indignation. Harman turned to me when he had
gone: "Well, what do you think? I suppose you agree with him." There was
only one possible answer and I made it:}{286236069 }{2855745116889536
"You're not paying me to do anything else but follow orders, boss. I'm
sticking with you." Just then Shelton came in and Harman packed us both
off to go over the calculations of the orbit of flight for the
ump-teenth time, while he himself went off to bed. The next day, July
15th, dawned in matchless splendor, and Harman, Shelton}{286236069 , and
}{2855745116889536 myself were in an almost gay mood as we crossed the
Hudson to where the Prometheus surrounded by an adequate police guardlay
in gleaming grandeur. Around it, roped off at an apparently safe
distance, rolled a crowd of gigantic proportions. Most of them were
hostile, raucously so. In fact, for one fleeting moment, as our
motorcycle police escort parted the crowds fo r us, the shouts and
imprecations that reached our ears almost convinced me that we should
have listened to Winstead. But Harman paid no attention to them at all,
after one su-percilious sneer at a shout of: "There goes John Harman,
son of Belial." Calmly, he d}{286236069 irected us about our task of
in}{2855745116889536 spection. I tested the foot-thick outer walls and
the air locks for leaks, then made sure the air purifier worked. Shelton
checked up on the repellen}{286236069 t screen and the fuel tanks.
Fi}{2855745116889536 nally, Harman tried on the clumsy spacesuit, found
it suitable, and announced himself ready. The crowd stirred. Upon a
hastily erected platform of wooden planks piled in confusion by some in
the mob, there rose up a striking figure. Tall and lean; with thin,
ascetic countenance; deep-set, burn ing eyes, peering and half closed; a
thick, white mane crowning allit was Otis Eldredge. The crowd recognized
him at once and many cheered. Enthusiasm waxed and soon the entire
turbulent mass of people shouted themselves hoarse over him. He raised a
hand for silence, turned to Harman, who re-garded him with surprise and
distaste, and pointed a long, bony finger at him: "John Harman, son of
the devil, spawn of Satan, you are here for an evil purpose. You are
about to set out upon a blasphemous attempt to pi erce the veil beyond
which man is forbidden to go. You are tasting of the forbidden fruit of
Eden and beware that you taste not of the fruits of sin." The crowd
cheered him to the echo and he continued: "The finger of God is upon
you, John Harman. He shall not allow His works to be defiled. You die
today, John Harman." His voice rose in intensity and his last words were
uttered in truly prophetlike fervor. Harman turned away in disdain. In a
loud, clear voice, he addressed the police sergeant: "Is
}{2855745116889536 ,}{2855745116889536 there an y way, officer, of
removing these spectators? The trial flight may be attended by some
destruction because of the rocket blasts, and they're crowding too
close." The policeman answered in a crisp, unfriendly tone: "If you're
afraid of being mobbed, say so, Mr. Harman. You don't have to worry,
though, we'll hold them back. And as for dangerfrom that contraption "
He sniffed loudly in the direction of the Prometheus, evoking a torrent
of jeers and yells. Harman said nothing further, but climbed into the
ship in silence. And when he did so, a queer sort of stillness fell over
the mob; a palpable tension. There was no attempt at rushing the ship,
an attempt I had thought inevitable. On the con- trary, Otis Eldredge
himself shouted to everyone to move back. "Leave the sinner to his
sins," he shouted. "'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord." As the moment
approached, Shelton nudged me. "Let's get out of here," he whispered in
a strained voice. "Those rocket blasts are poison." Saying this, he
broke into a run, beckon-ing anxiously for me to follow. We had not yet
reached the fringes of the crowd when there was a terrific roar behind
me. A wave of heated air swept over me. There was the frightening hiss
of some speeding object past my ear, and I was thrown violently to the
ground. For a few minutes I lay dazed, my ears ringing and my head
reeling. When I staggered drunkenly to my feet again, it was to view a
dreadful sight. Evidently, the entire fuel supply of the Prometheus had
exploded at once, and where it had lain a moment ago there was now only
a yawning hole. The ground was strewn with wrecka }{286236069
g}{2855745116889536 e. The cries of the hurt were heart-rending and the
mangled bodiesbut I won't try to describe those. A weak groan at my feet
attracted my attention. One look, and I gasped in horror, for it was
Shelton, the back of his head a bloody mass. "I did it." His voice was
hoarse and triumphant but withal so low that I could scarcely hear it.
"I did it. I broke open}{286236069 }{2855745116889536 the liquid-oxygen
compartments and when the s park went through the acetyline mixture the
whole cursed thing ex-ploded." He gasped a bit and tried to move but
failed. "A piece of wreckage must have hit me, but I don't care. I'll
die knowing that" His voice was nothing more than a rasping rattle, and
on his face was the ecstatic look of a martyr. He died then, and I could
not find it in my heart to condemn him. It was then I first thought of
Harman. Ambulances from Manhattan and from Jersey City were on the
scene, and one had sped to a wooden patch som e five hundred yards
distant where, caught in the treetops, lay a splintered fragment of the
Prometheus' forward compartment. I limped there as fast as I could, but
they had dragged out Harman and clanged away long before I could reach
them. After that, I didn't stay. The disorganized crowd had no thought
but for the dead and wounded now, but when they recovered, and bent
their thoughts to revenge, my life would not be worth a straw. I
followed the dictates of the better part of valor and quietly disappear
ed. The next week was a hectic one for me. During that time, I lay in
hiding at the home of a friend, for it would have been more than my life
was worth to allow myself to be seen and recognized. Harman, himself,
lay in a Jersey City hospi-tal, with nothing more than superficial cuts
and bruises}{2855745116889536 }{2855745116889536 thanks to the backward
force of the explosion and the saving clump of trees which cushioned the
fall of the Prometheus. It was on him that the brunt of the world's
wrath fell. New York, and the rest of the world also, just about went
crazy. Every last paper in the city came out with gigantic headlines,
"28 Killed, 73 Woundedthe Price of Sin," printed in blood-red letters.
The editorials howled for Har- man's life, demanding he be arrested and
tried for first-degree murder. The dreaded cry of "Lynch him!" was
raised throughout the five boroughs, and milling thousands crossed the
river and converged on Jersey City. At their head was Otis Eldredge,
both legs in splints, addressing the crowd from an open automobile as
the y marched. It was a veritable army. Mayor Carson of Jersey City
called out every available po-liceman and phoned frantically to Trenton
for the State mili-tia. New York clamped down on every bridge and tunnel
leaving the citybut not till after many thousands had left.
}2840-1506-1506006236069 {2855745116889536 There were pitched
battl}{286236069 es on the Jersey coast that six}{2855745116889536
teenth of July. The vastly outnumbered police clubbed indiscriminately
but were gradually pushed back and back. Mounties rode down upon the mob
relentlessly but were swallowed up and p ulled down by sheer force of
numbers. Not until tear gas was used, did the crowd haltand even then
they did not retreat. }2840-1506-1506005574511 {2855745116889536 The
next day, martial law was declared, and the State mili- tia entered
Jersey City. That was the end for the lynchers. Eldredge was called to
confer with the mayor, and after the conference ordered his followers to
disperse. In a statement to the newspapers, Mayor Carson said: "John
Harman must needs suffer for his crime, but it is es-sential that he do
so legally. Justice must take its course, and the State of New Jersey
will take all necessary measures." By the end of the week, normality of
a sort had returned and Harman slipped out of the public spotlight. Two
more weeks and there was scarcel}{286236069 y a word about hint in the
news}{2855745116889536 papers, exc epting such casual references to him
in the discus-sion of the new Zittman antirocketry bill that had just
passed both houses of Congress by unanimous votes. Yet he remained in
the hospital still. No legal action had been taken against him, but it
began to appear that a sort of indefinite imprisonment "for his own
protection" might be his eventual fate. Therefore, I bestirred myself to
action. Temple Hospital is situated in a lonely and outlying district of
Jersey City, and on a dark, moonless night I exper ienced no difficulty
at all in invading the grounds unobserved. With a facility that
surprised me, I sneaked in through a basement window, slugged a sleepy
interne into insensibility and proceeded to Room 15E, which was listed
in the books as Harman's.

"Who's there?" Harman's surprised shout was music in my ears. "Sh!
Quiet! It's I, Cliff McKenny." "You! What are you doing here?" "Trying
to get you out. If I don't, you're liable to stay here the rest of your
life. Come on, let's go." I was hustling him into his clothes while we
were speaking, and in no time at all we were sneaking down the corridor.
We were out safely and into my waiting car before Harman collected his
scattered wits sufficiently to begin asking ques-tions. "What's happened
since that day?" was the first question.}{286236069 }{2855745116889536
"I don't remember a thing after starting the rocket blasts un-til I woke
up in the hospital." "Didn't they tell you anything?" "Not a damn
thing," he swore. "I asked until I was hoarse." So I told him the whole
story from the explosi on on. His eyes were wide with shocked surprise
when I told of the dead and wounded, and filled with wild rage when he
heard of Shelton's treachery. The story of the riots and attempted
lynching evoked a muffled curse f}{286236069 rom}{ 2855745116889536
between set lips. "Of course, the papers howled 'murder,' " I concluded,
"but they couldn't pin that on you. They tried manslaughter, but there
were too many eye-witnesses that had heard your request for the removal
of the crowd and the police ser- geant's absolute refusal to do so.
That, of course, absolved you from all blame. The police sergeant
himself died in the explosion, and they couldn't make him the goat.
"Still, with Eldredge yelling for your hide, you're never safe. It would
be best to leave while able." Harman nodded his head in agreement.
"Eldredge survived the explosion, did he?" "Yes, worse luck. He broke
both legs, but it takes more than that to shut his mouth." Another week
had passed before I reached our future havenmy uncle's farm in
Minnesota. There, in a lonely and out-of-the-way rural community, we
stayed while the hulla- baloo over Harman's disappearance gradually died
down and the perfunctory search for us faded away. The search, by the
way, was short indeed, for the authorities seemed more re-lieved than
concerned over the disappearance. Peace and quiet did wonders with
Harman. In six months he seemed a new manquite ready to consider a
second attempt at space travel. Not all the misfortunes in the world
could stop him, it seemed, once he had his heart set on something. "My
mistake the first time," he told me one winter's day, "lay in announcing
the experiment. I should have taken the temper of the people into
account, as Winstead said. This time, however"he rubbed his hands and
gazed thoughtfully into the distance"I'll steal a march on them. The
experi-ment will be performed in secrecyabsolute secrecy."
}2840-1506-15060010375393 {2855745116889536 I laughed grimly. "It would
have to be. Do you know that}{2810375393 }{ 2855745116889536 all future
experiments in rocketry, even entirely theoretical research, is a crime
punishable by death?" }2840-1506-1506005574511 {2855745116889536 "Are
you afraid, then?" "Of course not, boss. I'm merely stating a fact. And
here's another plain fact. We two can't build a ship all by ourselves,
you know." "I've thought of that and figured a way out, Cliff. What's
more, I can take care of the money angle, too. You'll have to do some
traveling, though. "First, you'll have to go to Chicago and look up the
firm of Roberts & Scranton and withdraw everything that's left of my
father's inheritance, which," he added in a rueful aside, "is more tha n
half gone on the first ship. Then, locate as many of the old crowd as
you can: Harry Jenkins, Joe O'Brien, Neil Stantonall of them. And get
back as quickly as you can. I am tired of delay." Two days later, I left
for Chicago. Obtaining my uncle's consen t to the entire business was a
simple affair. "Might as well be strung up for a herd of sheep as for a
lamb," he grunted, "so go ahead. I'm in enough of a mess now and can
afford a bit more, I guess." It took quite a bit of traveling and even
more smooth talk and persuasion before I managed to get four men to
come: the three mentioned by Harman and one other, a Saul Simo- noff.
With that skeleton force and with the half million still left Harman out
of the reputed millions left him by his fa-ther, we began work. The
building of the New Prometheus is a story in itself a long story of five
years of discouragement and insecurity. Little by little, buying girders
in Chicago, beryl-steel plates in New York, a vanadium cell in San
Francisco, miscellaneous items in scattered corners of the nation, we
constructed the sister ship to the ill-fated Prometheus. The
difficulties in the way were all but unsuperable. To prevent drawing
suspicion down upon us, we had to spread our purchases over periods of
time, and to see to it, as well, that the orders were made out to
various places. For this we re-quired the co operation of various
friends, who, to be sure, did not know at the time for exactly what
purpose the pur-chases were being used. We had to synthesize our own
fuel, ten tons of it, and that was perhaps the hardest job of all;
certainly it took the most time. And finally, as Harman's money
dwindled, we came up against our biggest problemthe necessity of
economizing. From the beginning we had known that we could neve r make
the New Prometheus as large or as elaborate as the first ship had been,
but it soon developed that we would have to reduce its equipment to a
point perilously close to the danger line. The repulsive screen was
barely satisfactory and all attempts a t radio communication were
perforce abandoned. And as we labored through the years, there in the
backwoods of northern Minnesota, the world moved on, and Winstead's
prophecies proved to have hit amazingly near the mark. The events of
those five yearsfrom 1973 to 1978 are well known to the schoolboys of
today, the period being the climax of what we now call the
"Neo-Victorian Age." The happenings of those years seem well-nigh
unbelievable as we look back upon them now. The outlawing of all
research on space travel came in the very beginning, but was a bare
start compared to the anti-scientific measures taken in the ensuing
years. The next con- gressional elections, those of 1974, resulted in a
Congress in which Eldredge controlled the House and held the balance of
power in the Senate. Hence, no time was lost. At the first session of
the ninety-third Congress, the famous Stonely-Carter bill was passed. It
established the Federal Scientific Research Investigatory Bu-reauthe
FSRIBwhich was given full power to pass on the legality of all research
in the country. Every laboratory, in-dustrial or scholastic, was
required to file information, in ad-vance, on all projected research
before this new bureau, which could, and did, ban absolutely all such as
it disap -proved of. The inevitable appeal to the supreme court came on
November 9, 1974, in the case of Westly vs. Simmons, in which Joseph
Westly of Stanford upheld his right to continue his investigations on
atomic power on the grounds that the Stonely-Carter act w as
unconstitutional. How we five, isolated amid the snowdrifts of the
Middle West, followed that case! We had all the Minneapolis and St. Paul
papers sent to usalways reaching us two days lateand devoured every word
of print concerning it. For the two mo nths of suspense work ceased
entirely on the New Prome-theus. }2840-1506-15060010375393
{2855745116889536 It was rumored at first that the court }{2810375393
w}{2855745116889536 ould declare the act unconstitutional, and monster
parades were held in every large town against this even}{2810375393
tuality. The League of the Righ}{2855745116889536 teous brought its
powerful influence to bear and even the supreme court submitted. It was
five to four for constitution-ality. Science strangled by the vote of
one man. }2840-1506-1506005574511 {2855745116889536 And it was strangled
beyond a doubt. The members of the bureau were Eldredge men, heart and
soul, and nothing that would not have immediate industrial use was
passed. "Science has gone too far," said Eldredge in a famous speech at
about that time. "We must halt it indefinitely, and allow the world to
catch up. Only through that and trust in God may we hope to achieve
universal and permanent pros-perity." But this was one of Eldredge's
last statements. He had never fully recovered from the broken legs he
rec eived that fateful day in July of '73, and his strenuous life since
then strained his constitution past the breaking point. On February 2,
1976, he passed away amid a burst of mourning unequaled since Lincoln's
assassination. His death had no immediate effect on the course of
events. The rules of the FSRIB grew, in fact, in stringency as the years
passed. So starved and choked did science become, that once more
colleges found themselves forced to reinstate phi- losophy and the
classics as the chief studiesand at that the student body fell to the
lowest point since the beginning of the twentieth century. These
conditions prevailed more or less throughout the civ-ilized world,
reaching even lower depths in England, and per-haps least depressing in
Germany, which was the last to fall under the "Neo-Victorian" influence.
The nadir of science came in the spring of 1978, a bare month before the
completion of the New Prometheus, with the passing of the "Easter
Edict"it was issued the day before Easter. By it, all independent
research or experimenta- tion was absolutely forbidden. The FSRIB
thereafter reserved the right to allow only such rese}{2810375393 arch
as it specifically request}{2855745116889536 ed. John Harman and I stood
before the gleaming metal of the New Prometheus that Easter Sunday; I in
the deepest gloom, and he in an almost jovial mood. "Well, Clifford, my
boy," said he, "the last ton of fuel, a few polishing touches, and I am
ready for my second attempt. This time there will be no Sheltons among
us." He hummed a hymn. That was all the radio played those
days,}{2810375393 }{ 2855745116889536 and even we rebels sang them from
sheer frequency of repeti-tion. I grunted sourly: "It's no use, boss.
Ten to one, you end up somewhere in space, and even if you come back,
you'll most likely be hung by the neck. We can't win." My head shook
dolefully from side to side. "Bah! This state of affairs can't last,
Cliff." "I think it will. Winstead was right that time. The pendu-lum
swings, and since 1945 it's been swinging against us. We're ahead of the
timesor behind them." "Don't speak of that fool Winstead. You're making
the same mistake he did. Trends are things of centuries and
mil-lenniums, not years or decades. For five hundred years we have been
moving toward science. You can't reverse that in thirty years." "Then
what are we doing?" I asked sarcastically. "We're going through a
momentary reaction following a period of too-rapid advance in the Mad
Decades. Just such a reaction took place in the Romantic Agethe first
Victorian Periodfollowing the too-rapid advance of the
eighteenth-century Age of Reason." "Do you really think so?" I was
shaken by his evident self-assurance. "Of course. This period has a
perfect analogy in the spas-modic `revivals' that used to hit the small
towns in America's Bible Belt a century or so ago . For a week, perhaps,
everyone would get religion and virtue would reign triumphant. Then, one
by one, they would backslide and the Devil would resume his sway. "In
fact, there are symptoms of backsliding even now. The L. R. has indulged
in one squabble after another since Eldredge's death. There
ha}{2810375393 ve been half a dozen schisms al}{2855745116889536 ready.
The very extremities to which those in power are go-ing are helping us,
for the country is rapidly tiring of it." And that ended the argumentI
in total defeat, as usual. A month later, the New Prometheus was
complete. It was nowhere near as glittering and as beautiful as the
original, and bore many a trace of makeshift workmanship, but we were
proud of itproud and triumphant. }2840-1506-15060010375393
{2855745116889536 "I'm going to try again, men"Harman's voice was husky,
and his little frame vibrant with happiness "and I may not make it, but
for that I don't care." His eyes shone in antici-pation. "I'll be
shooting through the void at last, and the}{2810375393
}{2855745116889536 dream of mankind will come true. Out around the Moon
and back; the first to see the other side. It's worth the chance."
}2840-1506-1506005574511 {2855745116889536 "You won't have fuel enough
to land on the Moon, boss, which is a pity," I said. "That doesn't
matter. There'll be other flights after this, better prepared and better
equipped." At that a pessimistic whisper ran through the little group
surrounding him, to which he paid no attention. "Good-by," he said.
"I'll be seeing you." And with a cheer-ful grin he climbed into the
ship. Fifteen minutes later, the five of us sat about the liv-ing-room
table, frowning, lost in thought, eyes gazing out the building at the
spot where a burned section of soil marked the spot where a few minutes
earlier the New Prometheus had lain. Simonoff voiced the thought that
was in the mind of each one of us: "Maybe it would be better for him not
to come back. He won't be treated very well if he does, I think." And we
all nodded in gloomy assent. How foolish that prediction seems to me now
from the hindsight of three decades. The rest of the story is really not
mine, for I did not see Harman again until a month after his eventful
trip ended in a safe landing. It was almost thirty-six hours after the
take-off that a screaming projectile shot its way over Washington and
buried itself in the mud just across the Potomac. Investigators were at
the scene of the landing within fifteen minutes, and in another fifteen
minutes the police were there, for it was found that the projectile was
a rocketship. They stared in involuntary awe at t he tired, disheveled
man who staggered out in near-collapse. There was utter silence while he
shook his fist at the gawk-ing spectators and shouted: "Go ahead, hang
me, fools. But I've reached the Moon, and you can't hang that. Get the
FSRIB. Maybe they'll declare the flight illegal and, therefore,
nonexistent." He laughed weakly and suddenly collapsed. Someone shouted:
"Take him to a hospital. He's sick." In stiff unconsciousness Harman was
bundled into a police car and carried away, while the police formed a
guard about the rocketship. Government officials arrived and
investigated the ship, read the log, inspected the drawings and
photographs he had taken}{2810375393 }{2855745116889536 of the Moon, and
finally departed in silence. The crowd grew and the word spread that a
man had reached the Moon. Curiously enough, there was little resentment
of the fact. Men were impressed and awed; the crowd whispered and cast
inquisitive glances at the dim crescent of Luna, scarcely seen in the
bright sunlight. Over all, an uneasy pall of silence, the silence of
indecision, lay. Then, at the hospital, Harman revealed his identity,
and the fickle world went wild. Even Harman himself was stunned in
surprise at the rapid change in the world's temper. It seemed almost
incredible, and yet it was true. Secret dis- content, combined with a
heroic tale of man against over-whelming oddsthe sort of tale that had
stirred man's soul since the beginning of time served to sweep everyone
into an ever-swelling current of anti-Victorianism. And Eldredge was
deadno other could replace him. I saw Harman at the hospital shortly
after that. He was propped up and still half buried with papers,
telegrams and letters. He grinned at me and}{2810375393 nodded. "Well,
Cliff," he whis}{2855745116889536 pered, "the pendulum swung back
again." }{285574511 }00000 {7872413 }}
