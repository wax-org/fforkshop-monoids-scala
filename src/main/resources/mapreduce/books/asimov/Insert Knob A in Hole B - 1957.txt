their spacesuits, supervised }{0-1184 anxiously as the large crate swung
slowly out and away from the freight-ship }{184 and into the airlock.
With nearly a yea r of their hitch on Space Station A5 behind them, they
were understandably weary of filtration units that clanked, hydroponic
tubs that leaked, air generators that hummed con-stantly and stopped
occasionally.}{ }{184 "Nothing works," Woodbury would say mournfully,
"because everything }{0-1184 is hand-assembled by ourselves."}{ }{184
"Following directions," Hansen would add, "composed by an idiot."}{
}{184 There were undoubtedly grounds for complaint there. The most
expen-sive thing about a spaceship was the room allowed for freight so
all equip- ment had to be sent across space disassembled and nested. All
equipment had to be assembled at the Station itself with clumsy hands,
inadequate tools and with blurred and ambiguous direction sheets for
guidance.}{ }{184 Painstakingly Woodbury had written complaints to which
Hansen had added appropriate adjectives, and formal requests for relief
of the situation had made their way back to Earth.}{ }{184 And Earth had
responded. A special robot had been designed, with a positronic brain
crammed with the knowledge of how to assemble properly any disassembled
machine in existence.}{ }{184 That robot was in the crate being unloaded
now and Woodbury was trembling as the airlock closed behind it.}{
}{-1-81 "First," he said, "it overhauls the Food-Assembler and adjusts
the steak-}{-1-61 attachment knob so we can get it rare instead of
burnt."}{ }{-1-61 They entered the Station and attacked the crate with
dainty touches of }{-2-101 the demoleculizer rods in order to make sure
that not a precious metal atom }{-2-111 of their special assembly-robot
was damaged.}{ }{-1-91 The crate fell open!}{ }00000 {-1-81 And there
within it were five hundred separate piecesand one blurred }{-2-101 and
ambiguous direction sheet for assemblage.}{
