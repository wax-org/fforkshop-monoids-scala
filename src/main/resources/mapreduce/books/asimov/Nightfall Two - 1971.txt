}34003401135618 8 {02186512031135618 There is a perennial question among
readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views
of the author. The answer is, 'Not necessarily - And yet one ought to
add another }{04186512031135618 short phrase '- but
usually.'}{86512031135618 }1922919192901135618 8 {15186512031135618 When
I write a story in which opposing characters have }{02186512031135618
opposing viewpoints, I do my best, in so far as it lies within my
capabilities, to let each character express his own viewpoint
}{01186512031135618 honestly.}{86512031135618 }2061914141901135618 8
{02186512031135618 There are few people who, like Richard III in
Shakespeare's }{ 0-1186512031135618 play, are willing to say: 'since I
cannot prove a lover to entertain }{04186512031135618 these fair and
well-spoken days, I am determined to prove a }{ 186512031135618
villain.'}{86512031135618 }1781929291901135618 8 {03186512031135618 No
matter how villainous Tom may appear to Dick, Tom un-d oubtedly has
arguments, quite sincerely felt, to prove to him-}{01186512031135618
self that he is not villainous at all. It is therefore quite ridiculous
}{186512031135618 to have a villain act ostentatiously like a villain
(unless you have }{01186512031135618 the genius of Shakespeare and can
carry off }{01186512031135618 anything - }{ 01186512031135618 and I'm
}{02186512031135618 afraid I haven't).}{86512031135618
}1871019191001135618 8 {03186512031135618 Still, no matter how I try to
be fair, and how I try to present }{ 02186512031135618 each person's
views honestly, I cannot make myself be as con-vincing in presenting
views that don't appeal to me, as in pre-}{04186512031135618 senting
those that do. Besides, the general working out of my
}{01186512031135618 story usually proceeds as I want it to; the victory,
in one way or }{02186512031135618 another, tends to lie with those
characters whom I particularly like. Even if the ending is tragic, the
point of the story (I hate to use the word 'moral') is usually one that
satisfies me.}{86512031135618 }18253838501135618 8 {0-1186512031135618
In short, if you ignore the fine details of any of my stories and }{
04186512031135618 consider it as a whole, I think you will find that the
feeling it }{03186512031135618 leaves with you is the feeling that I
myself feel. It isn't a matter }{ 01186512031135618 of conscious
propaganda; it's just that I am a human being who feels something and
who cannot help having that feeling show in the story.}{86512031135618

-}{86512031135618 }17804848001135618 8 {01186512031135618 In 1951, Mr.
Raymond J. Healy, an anthologist of note, was }{ 0-1186512031135618
planning a collection of original science fiction stories, and asked
}{02186512031135618 me to write one. He made only one specification. He
wanted an }{ 15186512031135618 upbeat story - something which, in my own
more unsophisti-}{01186512031135618 cated way, I called a 'happy ending'
story. }{ 03186512031135618 . So I wrote a happy ending, but since I
always try to beat the }{02186512031135618 rules out of sheer bravado, I
tried to write an unexpected happy}{ 86512031135618 }{01186512031135618
ending, one in which the reader doesn't find out till the very end
}{02186512031135618 what the happy ending really is.}{ 86512031135618
}17814001401135618 8 {02186512031135618 It was only after I had

published, }{186512031135618 that I }{04186512031135618 realized that my
interest in technique had for once blinded me }{186512031135618 to
content. Somehow this particular story, 'In a Good Cause ,'

Conklin, the late perceptive science fiction critic, once }{
01186512031135618 said that he liked this story, even though he
disagreed with its philosophy, and to my embarrassment, I find that that
is exactly }{03186512031135618 how I myself feel.}{86512031135618

too high, the nose a shade }{01186512031135618 too symmetrical, the
clothing a shade too carefully disposed. }{0-2186512031135618 The whole
bearing is by far too saintly to be true. One can sup-pose that the man

certainly, Dick Altmayer was fully }{ 03186512031135618 capable of
feeling fury. His hair was as yet dark brown and he }{02186512031135618
had not grown the mustache which, in later years, would be so
characteristic of him. His nose was, of course, thin and
high-}{17186512031135618 bridged, but the contours of his face were
youthful. It would }{ 03186512031135618 be only later that the growing

pre-}{02186512031135618 sent any defense, he was sentenced to jail for
the term of three }{ 01186512031135618 years or for the duration of the
war, whichever should be longer. }{17186512031135618 He served a little
over four years and two months, at which }{ 03186512031135618 time the
war ended in a definite though not shattering Santan-}{02186512031135618
nian defeat. Earth gained complete control of certain disputed }{

of course, most of their crews, and in }{02186512031135618 addition,
several millions of lives due to the bombardment of planetary surfaces
from space. The fleets of the two contending }{ 01186512031135618 powers
had been sufficiently strong to restrict this bombardment
}{15186512031135618 to the outposts of their respective systems, so that
the planets }{ 02186512031135618 of Earth and Santanni, themselves, were

{02186512031135618 The war conclusively established Earth as the

8 {02186512031135618 They were the first Diaboli ever to have appeared
on the sur-}{ 01186512031135618 face of Earth itself. The. projection
posters and the newscasts of }{02186512031135618 the Federalist party
made that abundantly clear to any who were }{ 15186512031135618 unaware
of that. Over and over, they repeated the chronology
}{0-1186512031135618 of events.}{86512031135618 }18202929006440878 8
{04186512031135618 It was toward the beginning of the century that human
ex-}{02186512031135618 plorers first came across the Diaboli. They were
intelligent and }{03186512031135618 had discovered interstellar travel
independently somewhat ear-}{02186512031135618 lier than had the humans.
Already the galactic volume of their }{03186512031135618 dominions was
greater than that which was human-occupied.}{86512031135618
}17852424506440878 8 {02186512031135618 Regular diplomatic relationships
between the Diaboli and the }{03186512031135618 major human powers had
begun twenty years earlier, immedi-}{02186512031135618 ately after the
war between Santanni and Earth. At that time, }{17186512031135618
outposts of Diabol i power were already within twenty light
}{03186512031135618 years of the outermost human centers. Their missions
went }{01186512031135618 everywhere, drawing trade treaties, obtaining
concessions on un-occupied asteroids.}{86512031135618 }18214551406440878
8 {17186512031135618 And now they were on Earth itself. They were
treated as }{15186512031135618 equals and perhaps as more than equals by
the rulers of the }{03186512031135618 greatest center of human
population in the Galaxy. The most }{02186512031135618 damning statistic
of all was the most loudly proclaimed by the }{03186512031135618
Federalists. It was this: Although the number of living Diaboli
}{04186512031135618 was somewhat less than the total number of living
humans, }{03186512031135618 humanity had opened up not more than five
new worlds to colonization in fifty years, while the Diaboli had begun
the occupation of nearly five hundred.}{86512031135618
}1782910102906440878 8 {03186512031135618 'A hundred to one against us,'
cried the Federalists, 'because }{ 02186512031135618 they are one
political organization and we are a hundred.' But }{01186512031135618
relatively few on Earth, and fewer in the Galaxy as a whole, paid }{
17186512031135618 attention to the Federalists and their demands for
Galactic }{03186512031135618 Union.}{86512031135618 }17338003806440878 8
{02186512031135618 The crowds that lined the streets along which nearly
daily the five D iaboli of the mission traveled from their specially
con-ditioned suite in the best hotel of the city to the Secretariat of
Defense were, by and large, not hostile. Most were merely
curi-}{03186512031135618 ous, and more than a little
revolted.}{86512031135618 }18248004806440878 8 {02186512031135618 The
Diaboli were not pleasant creatures to look at. They were larger and
considerably more massive than Earthmen. They had four stubby legs set
close together below and two flexibly-fin-}{03186512031135618 gered arms
above. Their skin was wrinkled and naked and they}{6440878
}{02186512031135618 wore no clothing. Their broad, scaly faces wore no
expressions }{03186512031135618 capable of being read by Earthmen, and
from flattened regions }{04186512031135618 just above each
large-pupilled eye there sprang short horns. It }{03186512031135618 was
these last that gave the creatures their names. At first they
}{02186512031135618 had been called devils, and later the politer Latin
equivalent.}{86512031135618 }17814551406440878 8 {02186512031135618 Each
wore a pair of cylinders on its back from which flexible }{
04186512031135618 tubes extended to the nostrils; there they clamped on
tightly. }{01186512031135618 These were packed with soda-lime which
absorbed the, to them, }{ 02186512031135618 poisonous carbon dioxide
from the air they breathed. Their own }{04186512031135618 metabolism
revolved about the reduction of sulfur and some-}{ 19186512031135618
time those foremost among the humans in the crowd caught
}{02186512031135618 a foul whiff of the hydrogen sulfide exhaled by the
Diaboli.}{ 86512031135618 }17810551006440878 8 {03186512031135618 The
leader of the Federalists w as in the crowd. He stood far back where he
attracted no attention from the police who had }{01186512031135618 roped
off the avenues and who now maintained a watchful order }{
03186512031135618 on the little hoppers that could be maneuvered quickly
through }{18186512031135618 the thickest crowd. The Federalist leader
was gaunt-faced, }{ 03186512031135618 with a thin and prominently
bridged nose and straight, graying }{0-1186512031135618
hair.}{86512031135618 }1820018206440878 8 {04186512031135618 He turned

}1731010101006440878 8 {03186512031135618 His companion was more
philosophic. He said, 'No uglier in }{01186512031135618 spirit, at
least, than some of our handsome officials. These
crea-}{03186512031135618 tures are at least true to their
own."}{86512031135618 }1870018706440878 8 {04186512031135618 'You are

human, no matter how close. To be sure, they could }{16186512031135618
communicate by making ordinary sounds to one another but that was not
their method of choice. The skin between their }{ 02186512031135618
horns could, by the actions of muscles which differed in their
}{04186512031135618 construction from any known to humans, vibrate
rapidly. The }{ 16186512031135618 tiny waves which were transmitted in
this manner to the air }{03186512031135618 were too rapid to be heard by
the human ear and too delicate to }{ 02186512031135618 be detected by
any but the most sensitive of human instrumenta-}{16186512031135618
tion. At that time, in fact, humans remained unaware of this }{
02186512031135618 form of communication.}{86512031135618
}17851919506440878 8 {03186512031135618 A vibration said, 'Did you know

There was a chorus of such nos, and then o ne particular vibration said,

{03186512031135618 'Because I study the communications? More of our
people should do so instead of insisting so firmly on the complete

are in a }{ 186512031135618 much better position to deal with the
Two-legs if we know some-}{03186512031135618 thing about them. Their

{15186512031135618 'And yet,' came another vibration, 'from our previous
con-}{16186512031135618 tacts with Two-legs, one would be certain that
they did not }{03186512031135618 know their planet of origin. Certainly
there is no veneration of }{02186512031135618 this planet, Earth, or any

understandable in the light of Two-leg history. The Two-legs on the

side along the table. They }{17186512031135618 stood because their
anatomy did not admit of anything that }{02186512031135618 could
correspond to 'sitting'. On the other side of the table, five
}{15186512031135618 Earthmen stood as well. It would have been more
convenient for the humans to sit but, understandably, there was no
desire }{02186512031135618 to make the handicap of smaller size any more
pronounced than }{ 04186512031135618 it already was. The table was a
rather wide one; the widest, in }{03186512031135618 fact, that could be
conveniently obtained. This was out of res-}{ 16186512031135618 pect for
the human nose, for from the Diaboli, slightly so as }{02186512031135618
they breathed, much more so when they spoke, there came the }{
04186512031135618 gentle and continuous drift of hydrogen sulfide. This
was a }{02186512031135618 difficulty rather unprecedented in diplomatic
negotiations.}{ 86512031135618 }197055006440878 8 {16186512031135618
Ordinarily the meetings did not last for more than half an
}{02186512031135618 hour, and at the end of this interval the Diaboli
ended their con-}{03186512031135618 versations without ceremony and
turned to leave. This time, however, the leave-taking was interrupted. A
man entered, and }{ 01186512031135618 the five human negotiators made
way for him. He was tall, taller }{17186512031135618 than any of the
other Earthmen, and he wore a uniform with }{ 16186512031135618 the ease
of long usage. His face was round and his eyes cold }{03186512031135618
and steady. His black hair was rather thin but as yet untouched }{
15186512031135618 by gray. There was an irregular blotch of scar tissue
running }{02186512031135618 from the point of his jaw downward past the
line of his high, leather-brown collar. It might have been the result of
a hand }{17186512031135618 energy-ray, wielded by some forgotten human
enemy in one }{ 04186512031135618 of the five wars in which the man had
been an active partici-}{03186512031135618 pant.}{86512031135618
}1781419191406440878 8 {02186512031135618 'Sirs,' said the Earthman who
had been chief negotiator hith-}{ 04186512031135618 erto, 'may I
introduce the Secretary of Defense?'}{86512031135618
}1781014141006440878 8 {03186512031135618 The Diaboli were somewhat
shocked and, although their ex-}{02186512031135618 pressions were in
response and inscrutable, the sound plates on }{03186512031135618 their
foreheads vibrated actively. Their strict sense of hierarchy}{6440878 }{
03186512031135618 was disturbed. The Secretary was only a Two-leg, but
by Two-}{02186512031135618 leg standards, he outranked them. They could
not properly con-}{ 186512031135618 duct official business with
him.}{86512031135618 }18201919006440878 8 {01186512031135618 The
Secretary was aware of their feelings but had no choice in }{
04186512031135618 the matter. For at least ten minutes, their leaving
must be de-}{02186512031135618 layed and no ordinary interruption could
serve to hold back the }{ 0-2186512031135618 Diaboli.}{86512031135618
}17801919006440878 8 {04186512031135618 'Sirs,' he said, 'I must ask
your indulgence to remain longer }{ 02186512031135618 this
time.'}{86512031135618 }17801414006440878 8 {03186512031135618 The
central Diabolus replied in the nearest approach to
Eng-}{02186512031135618 lish any Diabolus could manage. Actually, a
Diabolus might be said to have two mouths. One was hinged at the
outermost ex-tremity of the jawbone and was used in eating. In this
capacity, }{01186512031135618 the motion of the mouth was rarely seen by
human beings, since }{03186512031135618 the Diaboli much preferred to
eat in the company of their own }{02186512031135618 kind exclusively. A
narrower mouth opening, however, perhaps two inches in width, could be
used in speaking. It pursed itself open, revealing the gummy gap where a
Diabolus' missing in-}{03186512031135618 cisors ought to have been. It
remained open during speech, the }{02186512031135618 necessary
consonantal blockings being performed by the palate }{03186512031135618
and back of the tongue. The result was hoarse and fuzzy, but
}{01186512031135618 understandable.}{86512031135618 }17301414006440878 8
{04186512031135618 The Diabolus said, 'You will pardon us, already we
suffer.' }{02186512031135618 And by his forehead, he twittered unheard,
'They mean to suffo-cate us in their vile atmosphere. We must ask for
larger poison-absorbing cylinders.'}{86512031135618 }17351010506440878 8
{03186512031135618 The Secretary of Defense said, 'I am in sympathy with
your }{01186512031135618 feelings, and yet this may be my only
opportunity to speak with }{03186512031135618 you. Perhaps you would do
us the honor to eat with us.'}{86512031135618 }16814551406440878 8
{15186512031135618 The Earthmen next the Secretary could not forbear a
quick }{01186512031135618 a nd passing frown. He scribbled rapidly on a
piece of paper and }{03186512031135618 passed it to the Secretary, who
glanced momentarily at it.}{86512031135618 }16329002906440878 8
{02186512031135618 It read, 'No. They eat sulfuretted hay. Stinks
unbearably.' The }{ 04186512031135618 Secretary crumpled the note and
let it drop.}{86512031135618 }17324002406440878 8 {15186512031135618 The
Diabolus said, 'The honor is ours. Were we physically
}{03186512031135618 able to endure your strange atmosphere for so long a
time, we }{02186512031135618 would accept most
gratefully.'}{86512031135618 }17329002906440878 8 {02186512031135618 And
via forehead, he said with agitation, 'They cannot expect }{

of }{03186512031135618 dead animals. My cud would never be sweet
again.'}{86512031135618 }211000006440878 8 {18186512031135618 'We
respect your reasons,' said the Secretary. 'Let us then}{6440878

have so far proceeded, we have been unable to obtain from your
govern-}{0-1186512031135618 ment, in the persons of you, their
representatives, any clear in-}{ 186512031135618 dication as to what the
boundaries of your sphere of influence }{0-2186512031135618 are in your

matter.'}{86512031135618 }1821014141006440878 8 {0-2186512031135618 'As

}18251010506440878 8 {01186512031135618 'But surely you must see that
this is unsatisfactory. The }{0-1186512031135618 boundaries of Earth and
your lands are nowhere in contact. So }{186512031135618 far, you have
done nothing but state this fact. While true, the }{0-1186512031135618
mere statement is not satisfying.'}{ 86512031135618 }1781010101006440878
8 {186512031135618 'We do not completely understand. Would you have us

}1781410101406440878 8 {186512031135618 'Then you will negotiate a

}17814551406440878 8 {0-1186512031135618 'It is necessary. I would point
out, however, that the necessity }{ 0-2186512031135618 is imposed not by

tion.'}{86512031135618 }18710551006440878 8 {0-2186512031135618 'Then
that limits our field of discussion drastically.' The Sec-}{
0-1186512031135618 retary seemed abstracted. He was listening, not
exactly to the Diaboli opposite, but, rather, it would seem, to
something at a }{0-4186512031135618 distance.}{ 86512031135618
}18710001006440878 8 {186512031135618 And now there was a faint
commotion, barely heard from }{0-1186512031135618 outside the
Secretariat. The babble of distant voices, the brisk
}{0-3186512031135618 crackle of energy-guns muted by distance to nearly
nothingness, }{0-2186512031135618 and the hurried click-clacking of
police hoppers.}{86512031135618 }17814001406440878 8 {186512031135618
The Diaboli showed no indication of hearing, nor was this
}{0-2186512031135618 simply another affectation of politeness. If their
capacity for }{01186512031135618 receiving supersonic sound waves was
far more delicate and }{0-2186512031135618 acute than almost anything
human ingenuity had ever invented, }{18186512031135618 their reception
for ordinary sound waves was rather dull.}{86512031135618
}1821410101406440878 8 {0-2186512031135618 The Diabolus was saying, 'We
beg leave to state our surprise. }{ 0-1186512031135618 We were of the
opinion that all this was known to you.'}{86512031135618
}1825810105806440878 8 {03186512031135618 A man in police uniform
appeared in the doorway. The Sec- retary turned to him and, with the
briefest of nods, the police-man departed.}{86512031135618
}17858005806440878 8 {15186512031135618 The Secretary said suddenly and
briskly, 'Quite. I merely }{02186512031135618 wished to ascertain once
again that this was the case. I trust you }{03186512031135618 will be
ready to resume negotiations tomorrow?'}{86512031135618
}2350023506440878 8 {03186512031135618 'Certainly, sir.'}{86512031135618
}240000006440878 8 {15186512031135618 One by one, slowly, with a dignity
befitting the heirs of the }{02186512031135618 universe, the Diaboli
left. }{0316440878 }{03186512031135618 An Earthman said, 'I'm glad they
refused to eat with us.'}{86512031135618 }18743004306440878 8
{16186512031135618 'I knew they couldn't accept,' said the Secretary,
thought-}{03186512031135618 fully. 'They're vegetarian. They sicken
thoroughly at the very }{02186512031135618 thought of eating meat. I've
seen them eat, you know. Not many }{01186512031135618 humans have. They
resemble our cattle in the business of eating. }{04186512031135618 They
bolt their food and then stand solemnly about in circles, chewing their
cuds in a great community of thought. Perhaps }{ 15186512031135618 they
intercommunicate by a method we are unaware of. The }{16186512031135618
huge lower jaw rotates horizontally in a slow, grinding pro-}{
15186512031135618 cess -'}{86512031135618 }2300023006440878 8
{03186512031135618 The policeman had once more appeared in the
doorway.}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 The Secretary broke off,
and called, 'You have them all?"}{86512031135618 }{16186512031135618
'Yes, sir.'}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 'Do you have

}1735819195806440878 8 {02186512031135618 The crowd had gathered again
when the five Diaboli emerged from the Secretariat}{ 02114756080 . The
schedule was strict. At 3}{02186512031135618 :00 }{02186512031135618
p.m. }{02186512031135618 each day they left their suite and spent five
minutes walking to the }{01186512031135618 Secretariat. At 3 :35, they
emerged therefrom once again and re-}{15186512031135618 turned to their
suite, the way being kept clear by the police. }{02186512031135618 They
marched stolidly, almost mechanically, along the broad
}{0-4186512031135618 avenue.}{ 86512031135618 }1736219196206440878 8
{02186512031135618 Halfway in their trek there came the sounds of
shouting men. }{ 04186512031135618 To most of the crowd, the words were
not clear but there was }{186512031135618 the crackle of an energy-gun
and the pale blue fluorescence split }{ 01186512031135618 the air
overhead. Police wheeled, their own energy-guns drawn,
}{03186512031135618 hoppers springing seven feet into the air, landing
delicately in }{ 02186512031135618 the midst of groups of people,
touching none of them, jumping again almost instantly. People scattered
and their voices were joined to the general uproar.}{86512031135618
}17802929006440878 8 {15186512031135618 Through it all, the Diaboli,
either through defective hearing or excessive dignity, continued
marching as mechanically as }{0-4186512031135618 ever.}{86512031135618
}178555506440878 8 {03186512031135618 At the other end of the gathering,
almost diametrically op-}{02186512031135618 posing the region of
excitement, Richard Sayana Altmayer stro-}{03186512031135618 ked his
nose in a moment of satisfaction. The strict chronology of the Diaboli
had made a split-second plan possible. The first }{ 17186512031135618
diversionary disturbance was only to attract the attention of
}{04186512031135618 the police. It was now -}{86512031135618
}1870018706440878 8 {03186512031135618 And he fired a harmless sound
pellet into the air.}{86512031135618 }17810001006440878 8
{17186512031135618 Instantly, from four directions, concussion pellets
split the }{ 02186512031135618 air. From the roofs of buildings lining
the way, snipers fired.}{02114756080 }{17186512031135618 Each of the
Diaboli, torn by the shells, shuddered and ex-}{15186512031135618 ploded
as the pellets detonated within them. One by one, they
}{01186512031135618 toppled.}{ 86512031135618 }1682414142406440878 8
{04186512031135618 And from nowhere, the police were at Altmayer's side.
He }{03186512031135618 stared at them with some
surprise.}{86512031135618 }1821410101406440878 8 {16186512031135618
Gently, for in twenty years he had lost his fury and learned }{
02186512031135618 to be gentle, he said, 'You come quickly, but even so
you come too Iate.' He gestured in the direction of the shattered
Diaboli.}{86512031135618 }17814551406440878 8 {16186512031135618 The
crowd was in simple panic now. Additional squadrons }{04186512031135618
of police, arriving in record time, could do nothing more than
}{03186512031135618 herd them off into harmless
directions.}{86512031135618 }12514001406440878 8 {01186512031135618 .
The policeman, who now held Altmayer in a firm grip, taking }{
03186512031135618 the sound gun from him and inspecting him quickly for
further }{02186512031135618 weapons, was a captain by rank. He said,
stiffly, 'I think you've }{ 03186512031135618 made a mistake, Mr.
Altmayer. You'll notice you've drawn no }{01186512031135618 blood.' And
he, too, waved toward where the Diaboli lay motion-}{ 0-3186512031135618
less.}{86512031135618 }17814001406440878 8 {15186512031135618 Altmayer
turned, startled. The creatures lay there on their }{02186512031135618
sides, some in pieces, tattered skin shredding away, frames
dis-}{15186512031135618 torted and bent, but the police captain was
correct. There was }{01186512031135618 no blood, no flesh. Altmayer's
lips, pale and stiff, moved sound-}{0-2186512031135618
lessly.}{86512031135618 }1782410102406440878 8 {02186512031135618 The
police captain interpreted the motion accurately enough. }{
03186512031135618 He said, 'You are correct, sir, they are
robots.'}{86512031135618 }17819001906440878 8 {04186512031135618 And
from the great doors of the Secretariat of Defense, the
}{02186512031135618 true Diaboli emerged. Clubbing policemen cleared the
way, but }{04186512031135618 another way, so that they need not pass the
sprawled travesties }{15186512031135618 of plastic and aluminium which
for three minutes had played }{02186512031135618 the role of living
creatures.}{86512031135618 }18201919006440878 8 {02186512031135618 The
police captain said, 'I'll ask you to come witho ut trouble, Mr.
Altmayer. The Secretary of Defense would like to see
you.'}{86512031135618 }17352424506440878 8 {03186512031135618 'I am
coming, sir.' A stunned frustration was only now be-}{02186512031135618
ginning to overwhelm him.}{86512031135618 }19251414506440878 8
{03186512031135618 Geoffrey Stock and Richard Altmayer faced one another
for the first time in almost a quarter of a century, there in the
De-}{186512031135618 fense Secretary's private office. It was a rather
strait-laced office: }{ 02186512031135618 a desk, an armchair, and two
additional chairs. All were a dull }{01186512031135618 brown in color,
the chairs being topped by brown foamite which }{ 02186512031135618
yielded to the body enough for comfort, not enough for luxury. There was
a micro-viewer on the desk and a little cabinet big enough to hold
several dozen opto-spools. On the wall opposite }{ 01186512031135618 the
desk was a trimensional view of the old }{01186512031135618 Dauntless,
}{01186512031135618 the Sec-}{ 02186512031135618 retary's first
command.}{86512031135618 }18251414506440878 8 {03186512031135618 Stock
said, 'It is a little ridiculous meeting like this after so }{
04186512031135618 many years. I find I am sorry.'}{86512031135618
}{15186512031135618 'Sorry about what, Jeff?' Altmayer tried to force a
smile, 'I }{03186512031135618 am sorry about nothing but that you
tricked me with those ro-}{ 02186512031135618 bots.'}{86512031135618
}{03186512031135618 'You were not difficult to trick,' said Stock, 'and
it was an }{15186512031135618 excellent opportunity to break your party.
I'm sure it will be }{ 03186512031135618 quite discredited after this.
The pacifist tries to force war; the }{01186512031135618 apostle of

said, 'It's been a long journey for the two of us, Dick. We've

the results for you. - I was twenty-five when I first visited

enough. You wanted to force the }{0-1186512031135618 human governments

politically unrealistic and completely impossible. It wasn't even
}{0-1186512031135618 desirable. Humans are not Diaboli. Among the
Diaboli, indi-}{0-3186512031135618 vidual consciousness is low, almost
nonexistent. Ours is almost }{0-1186512031135618 overpowering. They have
no such thing as politics; we have nothing else. They can never
disagree, can have nothing ,but a }{0-4186512031135618 single
government. We can never agree; if we had a single island }{

point. To }{0-2186512031135618 be sure, Greece could never unite and was
therefore ultimately conquered. But even in her state of disunion, she
defeated the }{0-3186512031135618 gigantic Persian Empire.

untried. In fifty years, only such advances have been made by them as
they have been able to copy from the various human navies. Humanity, on
the other hand, has competed }{01186512031135618 ferociously in warfare.

over; and }{ 01186512031135618 henceforward the Diaboli will be confined

expansions as we permit.'}{ 86512031135618 }1920019206440878 8
{03186512031135618 Altmayer murmured incoherently.}{86512031135618
}197555506440878 8 {01186512031135618 Stock said, 'And now union becomes
necessary. After the de-}{02186512031135618 feat of Persia by the Greek

continued wars among themselves, so that first Macedon
}{03186512031135618 and then Rome conquered them. After Europe colonized
the }{02186512031135618 Americas, cut up Africa, and conquered Asia, a
series of con-}{04186512031135618 ti nued European wars led to European

writer, Toynbee, }{01186512031135618 first pointed out this difference
between what he called a "domi-}{04186512031135618 nant minority" and a

{02186512031135618 Easily the most frequently asked question put to any
writer of }{ 01186512031135618 science fiction stories is: 'Where do you
get your ideas?'}{86512031135618 }17824552406440878 8 {03186512031135618
I imagine the person who asks the question is sure that there }{
15186512031135618 is some mysterious kind of inspiration that can only
be pro-}{186512031135618 duced by odd and possibly illicit means, or
that the writer goes }{ 02186512031135618 through an eldritch ritual
that may even involve calling up the }{0-4186512031135618
devil.}{86512031135618 }18214551406440878 8 {16186512031135618 But the
answer is only, 'You can get an idea from anything }{ 03186512031135618
if you are willing to think hard enough and long
enough.'}{86512031135618 }1971014141006440878 8 {01186512031135618 That
long-and-hard bit seems to disillusion people. Their ad-}{
16186512031135618 miration for you drops precipitously and you get the
feeling }{03186512031135618 you have exposed yourself as an imposter.
After all, if long-}{ 02186512031135618 and-hard is all it takes,
}{02186512031135618 anyone }{02186512031135618 can do
it.}{86512031135618 }1870018706440878 8 {03186512031135618 Strange,
then, that so few do.}{86512031135618 }17801919006440878 8
{04186512031135618 Anyway, my wife once broke down and asked me that
ques-}{03186512031135618 tion even though she knows I dislike having it
asked. We had }{01186512031135618 moved to the Boston area in 1949, when
I took, my position with }{16186512031135618 Boston University School of
Medicine, and periodically we }{01186512031135618 made a train trip back
to New York to visit our respective fami-}{-1-6186512031135618 lies.}{
86512031135618 }17852929506440878 8 {16186512031135618 Once, on one of
those train trips, perhaps out of boredom, }{ 02186512031135618 she
asked The Question. I said, 'From anything. I can probably
}{04186512031135618 get one out of this train trip, if I
try.'}{86512031135618

}1820018206440878 8 {01186512031135618 'Go ahead,' she said, naturally
enough.}{86512031135618 }17803434006440878 8 {186512031135618 So I
thought hard and told her the story of a train trip which,
}{19186512031135618 when I got back home, I typed up in permanent form
and }{15186512031135618 called 'What If -'}{86512031135618
}18753838506440878 8 {01186512031135618 The story is unusual for me in
another respect, too. I am not }{ 16186512031135618 strong on romance in
my stories. Why that should be, I will }{02186512031135618 leave to the
parlor psychoanalyst. I merely state the fact.}{ 86512031135618
}17354343506440878 8 {15186512031135618 Sometimes, I do have women in my
stories. On rare occa-}{04186512031135618 sions, as in
}{04186512031135618 'Hostess', }{04186512031135618 the woman is even the
protagonist. But }{01186512031135618 even then romance is a minor
factor, if it appears at all.}{86512031135618 }1681053531006440878 8
{16186512031135618 In 'What if -,' however, the story is all romance.
Each time }{ 15186512031135618 I think of that, the fact startles me. I
believe it is the only one }{03186512031135618 of my many stories that
is all serious (as opposed to ribald) }{ 0-2186512031135618 romance.

{04186512031135618 Norman and Livvy were late, naturally, since catching
a train is always a matter of last-minute delays, so they had to take

toward the front; }{ 16186512031135618 the one with nothing before it
but the seat that faced wrong }{03186512031135618 way, with its back
hard against the front partition. While Nor-}{ 16186512031135618 man
heaved the suitcase onto the rack, Liwy found herself ,

nonsense.'}{86512031135618 }1785144144506440878 8 {03186512031135618
Liwy asked her favorite question: 'Norman, what if you had been one
minute later at the streetcar corner and had taken the
}{15186512031135618 next car? What }{15186512031135618 do you
}{15186512031135618 suppose would have happened?'}{86512031135618
}1820144144006440878 8 {02186512031135618 'And what if fish had wings
and all of them flew to the top of }{ 04186512031135618 the mountains?
What would we have to eat on Fridays then?'}{86512031135618
}18214001406440878 8 {03186512031135618 But they }{03186512031135618 had
}{ 03186512031135618 caught the streetcar, and fish }{03186512031135618
didn't }{03186512031135618 have wings, so that now they had been married
five years and ate fish on }{15186512031135618 Fridays. And because they
had been married five years, they }{03186512031135618 were going to
celebrate by spending a week in New York. }{86512031135618
}18219551906440878 8 {03186512031135618 Then she remembered the present
problem. 'I wish we could have found some other seat.'}{ 86512031135618
}18214551406440878 8 {04186512031135618 Norman said, 'Sure. So do I. But
no one has taken it yet, so }{02186512031135618 we'll have relative
privacy as far as Providence, anyway.'}{86512031135618
}18701010006440878 8 {01186512031135618 Livvy was unconsoled, and felt
herself justified when a plump }{ 15186512031135618 little man walked
down the central aisle of the coach. Now, }{01186512031135618 where had
he come from? The train was halfway between Boston }{ 02186512031135618
and Providence, and if he had had a seat, why hadn't he kept it?
}{04186512031135618 She took out her vanity and considered her
reflection. She had }{ 17186512031135618 a theory that if she ignored
the little man, he would pass by. }{04186512031135618 So she
concentrated on her light-brown hair which, in the rush }{
16186512031135618 of catching the train, had become disarranged just a
little; at }{02186512031135618 her blue eyes, and at her little mouth
with the plump lips w hich Norman said looked like a permanent
kiss.}{86512031135618 }1970019706440878 8 {03186512031135618 Not bad,
she thought.}{86512031135618 }19252424506440878 8 {03186512031135618
Then she looked up, and the little man was in the seat
oppo-}{04186512031135618 site. He caught her eye and grinned widely. A
series of lines }{02186512031135618 curled about the edges of his smile.
He lifted his hat hastily and }{16186512031135618 put it down beside him
on top of the little black box he had }{02186512031135618 been carrying.
A circle of white hair instantly sprang up stiffly }{15186512031135618
about the large bald spot that made the center of his skull a
}{0-2186512031135618 desert.}{86512031135618 }1782938382906440878 8
{02186512031135618 She could not help smiling back a little, but then
she caught }{ 16186512031135618 sight of the black box again and the
smile faded. She yanked }{186512031135618 at Norman's
elbow.}{86512031135618 }1782438382406440878 8 {15186512031135618 Norman
looked up from his newspaper. He had startlingly }{186512031135618 dark
eyebrows that almost met above the bridge of his nose,
giv-}{04186512031135618 ing him a formidable first appearance. But they
and the dark eyes beneath bent upon her now with only the usual look of
}{ 186512031135618 pleased and somewhat amused
affection.}{86512031135618 }1733448483406440878 8 {19186512031135618 He
said, What's up?' He did not look at the plump little }{186512031135618
man opposite.}{ 86512031135618 }1872943432906440878 8 {03186512031135618
Liwy did her best to indicate what she saw by a little unob-}{
02186512031135618 trusive gesture of her hand and head. But the little
man was }{16186512031135618 watching and she felt a fool, since Norman
simply stared at }{ 01186512031135618 her blankly.}{86512031135618
}168241010240666633 8 {210186512031135618 Finally she pulled him closer
and whispered, 'Don't you }{04186512031135618 see what's printed on his
box?'}{86512031135618 }1871455140666633 8 {03186512031135618 She looked
again as she said it, and there was no mistake. It }{16186512031135618
was not very prominent, but the light caught it slantingly and
}{02186512031135618 it was a slightly more glistening area on a black
background. In }{03186512031135618 fl owing script it said, 'What
If.'}{86512031135618 }1781400140666633 8 {03186512031135618 The little
man was smiling again. He nodded his head rapidly }{01186512031135618
and pointed to the words and then to himself several times
over.}{86512031135618 }192001920666633 8 {15186512031135618 Norman said
in an aside, 'Must be his name.'}{86512031135618 }197001970666633 8
{15186512031135618 Livvy replied, 'Oh, how could that be anybody's
name?'}{86512031135618 }178141010140666633 8 {03186512031135618 Norman
put his paper aside. 'I'll show you.' He leaned ovez? }{
16186512031135618 and said, 'Mr. If?'}{86512031135618 }197001970666633 8
{03186512031135618 The little man looked at him eagerly.}{86512031135618
}{16186512031135618 'Do you have the time, Mr. If?'}{86512031135618
}178141010140666633 8 {16186512031135618 The little man took out a large
watch from his vest pocket }{03186512031135618 and displayed the
dial.}{86512031135618 }1781455140666633 8 {15186512031135618 'Thank you,
Mr. If,' said Norman. And again in a whisper, }{17186512031135618 'See,
Liwy.'}{86512031135618 }18705500666633 8 {03186512031135618 He would
have returned to his paper, but the little man was }{15186512031135618
opening his box and raising a ringer periodically as he did so,
}{03186512031135618 to enforce their attention. It was just a slab of
frosted glass that he removed - about six by nine inches in length and
width and }{ 15186512031135618 perhaps an inch thick. It had beveled
edges, rounded corners, }{03186512031135618 and was completely
featureless. Then he took out a little wire }{ 04186512031135618 stand
on which the glass slab fitted comfortably. He rested the
}{03186512031135618 combination on his knees and looked proudly at
them.}{ 86512031135618 }1870101000666633 8 {03186512031135618 Liwy said,
with sudden excitement, 'Heavens, Norman, it's a }{04186512031135618
picture of some sort.'}{86512031135618 }1785141450666633 8
{03186512031135618 Norman bent close. Then he looked at the little man.
'What's }{04186512031135618 this? A new kind of
television?'}{86512031135618 }18201414001135618 8 {04186512031135618 The
little man shook his head, and Liwy said, 'No, Norman, it's }{
04186512031135618 us.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{17186512031135618 'What?'}{86512031135618 }187014140012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'Don't you see? That's the streetcar we met on. There
you are }{ 01186512031135618 in the back seat wearing that old fedora I
threw away three years }{04186512031135618 ago. And that's Georgette and
myself getting on. The fat lady's }{ 16186512031135618 in the way. Now!
Can't you see us?'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{04186512031135618 He muttered, 'It's some sort of
illusion.'}{86512031135618 }182514145012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'But
you see it too, don't you? That's why he calls this "What }{
210186512031135618 If." It will }{210186512031135618 show
}{210186512031135618 us what if. What if the streetcar hadn't }{
18186512031135618 swerved ...'}{86512031135618 }192105510012200168 8
{04186512031135618 She was sure of it. She was very excited and very
sure of it. }{ 02186512031135618 As she looked at the picture in the
glass slab, the late afternoon }{16186512031135618 sunshine grew dimmer
and the inchoate chatter of the pas-}{ 03186512031135618 sengers around
and behind them began fading.}{86512031135618 }182140014012200168 8
{03186512031135618 How she remembered that day. Norman knew Georgette
and }{01186512031135618 had been about to surrender his seat to her when
the car swerved }{04186512031135618 and threw Livvy into his lap. It was
such a ridiculously corny }{03186512031135618 situation, but it had
worked. She had been so embarrassed that }{16186512031135618 he was
forced first into gallantry and then into conversation.
}{02186512031135618 An introduction from Georgette was not even
necessary. By the time they got off the streetcar, he knew where she
worked.}{86512031135618 }19210101010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 She
could still remember Georgette glowering at her, sulkily }{
01186512031135618 forcing a smile when they themselves separated.
Georgette said, }{03186512031135618 'Norman seems to like
you.'}{86512031135618 }17810191910012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Livvy
replied, 'Oh, don't be silly! He was just being polite. }{
04186512031135618 But he is nice-looking, isn't he?'}{86512031135618
}18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 It was only six months after
that that they married.}{86512031135618 }182014140012200168 8
{15186512031135618 And now here was that same streetcar again, with
Norman }{17186512031135618 and herself and Georgette. As she thought
that, the smooth }{01186512031135618 train noises, the rapid clack-clack
of the wheels, vanished com-pletely. Instead, she was in the swaying
confines of the streetcar. }{ 02186512031135618 She had just boarded it
with Georgette at the previous stop.}{86512031135618 }187014140012200168
8 {02186512031135618 Livvy shifted weight with the swaying of the
streetcar, as did }{ 04186512031135618 forty others, sitting and
standing, all to the same monotonous }{03186512031135618 and rather
ridiculous rhythm. She said, 'Somebody's motioning }{ 04186512031135618
at you, Georgette. Do you know him?'}{86512031135618 }182519195012200168
8 {02186512031135618 'At me?' Georgette directed a deliberately casual
glance over }{ 03186512031135618 her shoulder. Her artificially long
eyelashes flickered. She said, }{04186512031135618 'I know him a little.
What do you suppose he wants?'}{ 86512031135618 }1870000012200168 8
{01186512031135618 'Let's find out,' said Liwy. She felt pleased and a
little wicked}{01112200168 . }{ 02186512031135618 Georgette had a
well-known habit of hoarding her male ac-}{03186512031135618
quaintances, and it was rather fun to annoy her this way. And }{
04186512031135618 besides, this one seemed quite ...
interesting.}{86512031135618 }187524245012200168 8 {01186512031135618
She snaked past the line of standees, and Georgette followed }{
03186512031135618 without enthusiasm. It was just as Livvy arrived
opposite the }{02186512031135618 young man's seat that the streetcar
lurched heavily as it rounded }{ 01186512031135618 a curve. Liwy
snatched desperately in the direction of the straps. }{03186512031135618
Her fingertips caught and she held on. It was a long moment }{
02186512031135618 before she could breathe. For some reason, it had
seemed that there were no straps close enough to be reached. Somehow,
she }{01186512031135618 felt that by all the laws of nature she should
have fallen.}{86512031135618 }182514145012200168 8 {02186512031135618
The young man did not look at her. He was smiling at
Georg-}{03186512031135618 ette and rising from his seat. He had
astonishing eyebrows that }{16186512031135618 gave him a rather
competent and self-confident appearance }{03186512031135618 Livvy
decided that she definitely liked him.}{86512031135618
}17310191910012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Georgette was saying, 'Oh no,
don't bother. We're getting off in about two stops.'}{ 86512031135618
}19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618 They did. Livvy said, 'I thought
we were going to Sach's.'}{86512031135618 }17314191914012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'We are. There's just something I remember having to
attend }{ 15186512031135618 to here. It won't take but a
minute.'}{86512031135618 }18214141414012200168 8 {03186512031135618
'Next stop, Providence!' the loud-speakers were blaring. The }{
15186512031135618 train was slowing and the world of the past had shrunk
itself }{01186512031135618 into the glass slab once more. The little man
was still smiling at }{ 186512031135618 them.}{86512031135618
}18214191914012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Liwy turned to Norman. She
felt a little frightened. 'Were }{ 04186512031135618 you through all
that, too?'}{86512031135618 }17319141419012200168 8 {03186512031135618
He said, 'What happened to the time? We can't be reaching
}{02186512031135618 Providence yet?' He looked at his watch. 'I guess we
are.' Then, }{04186512031135618 to Livvy, 'You didn't fall that
time.'}{86512031135618 }18714101014012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Then
you did see it?' She frowned. 'Now, that's like Georg-ette. I'm sure
there was no reason to get off the streetcar except }{04186512031135618
to prevent my meeting you. How long had you known
Georg-}{15186512031135618 ette before then, Norman?'}{ 86512031135618
}163295529012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Not very long. Just enough to
be able to recognize her at }{03186512031135618 sight and to feel that I
ought to offer her my seat.'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8
{16186512031135618 Liwy curled her lip.}{86512031135618
}17819101019012200168 8 {18186512031135618 Norman grinned, 'You can't be
jealous of a might-have-}{186512031135618 been, kid. Besides, what
difference would it have made? I'd have }{01186512031135618 been
sufficiently interested in you to work out a way of meeting
you.'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'You
didn't even look at me.'}{86512031135618 }{15186512031135618 'I hardly
had the chance.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {16186512031135618
'Then how would you have met me?'}{86512031135618 }18224101024012200168
8 {02186512031135618 'Some way. I don't know how. But you'll admit this
is a rather foolish argument we're having.'}{ 86512031135618
}182190019012200168 8 {16186512031135618 They were leaving Providence.
Liwy felt a trouble in her }{02186512031135618 mind. The little man had
been following their whispered con-versation, with only the loss of his
smile to show that he under-}{04186512031135618 stood. She said to him,
'Can you show us more?'}{ 86512031135618 }178245524012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Norman interrupted, "Wait now, Liwy. What are you
going }{16186512031135618 to try to do?'}{86512031135618
}18253101053012200168 8 {01186512031135618 She said, 'I want to see our
wedding day. What it would have }{ 04186512031135618 been if I had
caught the strap.'}{86512031135618 }178385538012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Norman was visibly annoyed. 'Now, that's not fair. We
might }{03186512031135618 not have been married on the same day, you
know.'}{86512031135618 }18729101029012200168 8 {04186512031135618 But
she said, 'Can you show it to me, Mr. If?' and the little }{
02186512031135618 man nodded.}{86512031135618 }182245524012200168 8
{04186512031135618 The slab of glass was coming alive again, glowing a
little. }{16186512031135618 Then the light collected and condensed into
figures. A tiny sound of organ music was in Livvy's ears, without there
ac-}{01186512031135618 tually being sound.}{86512031135618
}17819101019012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Norman said with relief,
'Well, there I am. That's our wed-}{ 02186512031135618 ding. Are you

The train sounds were disappearing again, and the last thing }{
02186512031135618 Livvy heard was her own voice saying, 'Yes, there
}{02186512031135618 you }{02186512031135618 are. But }{
16186512031135618 where am I?'}{86512031135618 }192014140012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Liwy was well back in the pews. For a while she had
not ex-}{18186512031135618 pected to attend at all. In the past months
she had drifted }{04186512031135618 further and further away from
Georgette, without quite know-}{17186512031135618 ing why. She had heard
of her engagement only through a }{04186512031135618 mutual friend, and,
of course, it was to Norman. She remem-}{15186512031135618 bered very
clearly that day, six months before, when she had }{02186512031135618
first seen him on the streetcar. It was the time Georgette had so
}{04186512031135618 quickly snatched her out of sight. She had met him
since on }{01186512031135618 several occasions, but each time Georgette
was with him, stand-ing between.}{86512031135618 }17310141410012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Well, she had no cause for resentment; the man was
certainly }{ 16186512031135618 none of hers. Georgette, she thought,
looked more beautiful }{03186512031135618 than she really was. And he
was very handsome indeed.}{86512031135618

}197014140012200168 8 {02186512031135618 She felt sad and rather empty,
as though something had gone wrong - something that she could not quite
outline in her mind. }{04186512031135618 Georgette had moved up the
aisle without seeming to see her, but earlier she had caught his eyes
and smiled at him. Liwy thought he had smiled in return.}{86512031135618
}187519195012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She heard the words distantly
as they drifted back to her, 'I }{ 15186512031135618 now pronounce you
-'}{86512031135618 }18751919506556944 8 {02186512031135618 The noise of
the train was back. A woman swayed down the }{03186512031135618 aisle,
herding a little boy back to their seats. There were
inter-}{02186512031135618 mittent bursts of girlish laughter from a set
of four teenage girls}{6556944 }{ 02186512031135618 halfway down the
coach. A conductor hurried past on some }{03186512031135618 mysterious
errand.}{86512031135618 }17800178012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Livvy
was frozenly aware of it all.}{86512031135618 }187105510012200168 8
{03186512031135618 She sat there, staring straight ahead, while the
trees outside }{ 04186512031135618 blended into a fuzzy, furious green
and the telephone poles }{01186512031135618 galloped
past.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She said,
'It was }{04186512031135618 she }{ 04186512031135618 you
married.'}{86512031135618 }182105510012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He
stared at her for a moment and then one side of his mouth }{
04186512031135618 quirked a little. He said lightly, 'I didn't really,
Olivia. You're }{01186512031135618 still my wife, you know. Just think
about it for a few minutes.'}{ 86512031135618 }1970550012200168 8
{04186512031135618 She turned to him. 'Yes, you married me - because I
fell in }{03186512031135618 your lap. If I hadn't, you would have
married Georgette. If she }{02186512031135618 hadn't wanted you, you
would have married someone else. You would have married anybody. So much
for your jigsaw puzzle }{ 186512031135618 pieces.'}{86512031135618
}1825005012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Norman said very slowly, 'Well -
I'll - be - darned! 'He put }{16186512031135618 both hands to his head
and smoothed down the straight hair }{15186512031135618 over his ears
where it had a tendency to tuft up. For the mo-}{03186512031135618 ment
it gave him the appearance of trying to hold his head
to-}{15186512031135618 gether. He said, 'Now, look here, Liwy, you're
making a silly }{04186512031135618 fuss over a stu pid magician's trick.
You can't blame me for something I haven't done.'}{86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'You would have done it.'

}{03186512031135618 'You've seen it.'}{86512031135618
}182140014012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'I've seen a ridiculous piece
of - of hypnotism, I suppose.' }{ 01186512031135618 His voice suddenly
raised itself into anger. He turned to the little }{03186512031135618
man opposite. 'Off with you, Mr. If, or whatever your name is. }{
17186512031135618 Get out of here. We don't want you. Get out before I
throw }{04186512031135618 your little trick out the window and you after
it.'}{86512031135618

}182105510012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Livvy yanked at his elbow.
'Stop it. Stop it! You're in a }{04186512031135618 crowded
train.'}{86512031135618 }187100010012200168 8 {16186512031135618 The
little man shrank back into the corner of the seat as far }{
02186512031135618 as he could go and held his little black bag behind
him. Norman }{04186512031135618 looked at him, then at Liwy, then at the
elderly lady across the }{ 03186512031135618 way who was regarding him
with patent disapproval.}{86512031135618 }178145514012200168 8
{04186512031135618 He turned pink and bit back a pungent remark. They
rode in frozen silence to and through New London.}{ 86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Fifteen minutes past New London,

{03186512031135618 She said nothing. She was looking out the window but
saw }{04186512031135618 nothing but the glass.}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {19186512031135618 He said again, 'Livvy! Livvy!
Answer me!'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She
said dully, 'What do you want?'}{86512031135618 }178014140012200168 8
{15186512031135618 He said, 'Look, this is all nonsense. I don't know
how the }{02186512031135618 fellow does it, but even granting it's
legitimate, you're not being }{04186512031135618 fair. Why stop where
you did? Suppose I had married Georg-ette, do you suppose you would have
stayed single? For all I }{ 03186512031135618 know, you were already
married at the time of my supposed }{04186512031135618 wedding. Maybe
that's why I married Georgette.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{15186512031135618 'I wasn't married.'}{86512031135618

were.'}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Then you

}178510105012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Liwy grew angrier. The fact
that a sane remnant within her }{04186512031135618 clamored at the
unreason of her anger did not soothe her. It }{03186512031135618
irritated her further, instead. She said, 'And if I did, it would be no
business of yours, certainly.'}{86512031135618

}182514145012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Of course it wouldn't. But it

right, then. You and Georgette would have gone to the

I would }{03186512031135618 have had nothing to do with it. Let him show
us the party as it }{04186512031135618 would have been if I had married

{04186512031135618 Liwy hesitated. She felt honestly afraid of just
that.}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 He said, 'Are you afraid to
take the chance?'}{86512031135618 }226000006556944 8 {16186512031135618
And that, of course, decided her. She turned on him
furi-}{03186512031135618 ously. 'No, I'm not! And I hope I am married.
There's no reason }{02186512031135618 I should pine for you. What's
more, I'd like to see what happens}{6556944 }{02186512031135618 when you
spill the shaker all over Georgette. She'll fill both
}{0-1186512031135618 your ears for you, and in public, too. I know her.
Maybe you'll see a certain difference in the jigsaw pieces then.' She
faced }{ 02186512031135618 forward and crossed her arms angrily and
firmly across her }{0-4186512031135618 chest.}{86512031135618
}178105510012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Norman looked across at the
little man, but there was no }{0-2186512031135618 need to say anything.
The glass slab was on his lap already. The }{186512031135618 sun slanted
in from the west, and the white foam of hair that }{0-1186512031135618
topped his head was edged with pink.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168

}18700187012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 Livvy nodded and let the noise
of the train slide away again.}{86512031135618 }187105510012200168 8
{0-1186512031135618 Livvy stood, a little flushed with recent cold, in
the doorway. }{ 0-2186512031135618 She had just removed her coat, with
its sprinkling of snow, and her bare arms were still rebelling at the
touch of open air.}{86512031135618 }1975005012200168 8 {186512031135618
She answered the shouts that greeted her with 'Happy New
}{0-1186512031135618 Years' of her own, raising her voice to make
herself heard over the squealing of the radio. Georgette's shrill tones
were almost }{01186512031135618 the first thing she heard upon entering,
and now she steered }{ 186512031135618 toward her. She hadn't seen
Georgette, or Norman, in weeks.}{86512031135618 }182100010012200168 8
{0-3186512031135618 Georgette lifted an eyebrow, a mannerism she had
lately culti-}{ 0-1186512031135618 vated, and said, 'Isn't anyone with
you, Olivia?' Her eyes swept }{01186512031135618 the immediate
surroundings and then returned to Liwy.}{ 86512031135618
}182105510012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Livvy said indifferently, 'I
think Dick will be around later. }{186512031135618 There was something
or other he had to do first.' She felt as }{0-2186512031135618
indifferent as she sounded.}{86512031135618 }187100010012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Georgette smiled tightly. 'Well, Norman's here. That
ought to keep you from being lonely, dear. At least, it's turned out
}{0-1186512031135618 that way before.'}{86512031135618 }1875555012200168
8 {0-2186512031135618 And as she said so. Norman sauntered in from the
kitchen. He }{ 0-1186512031135618 had a cocktail shaker in his hand, and
the rattling of ice cubes }{186512031135618 castanetted his words. 'Line
up, you rioting revelers, and get a }{ 01186512031135618 mixture that
will really revel your riots - Why, Livvy!'}{86512031135618
}182105510012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 He walked toward her, grinning
his welcome. 'Where've you }{0-3186512031135618 been keeping yourself? I
haven't seen you in twenty years, seems }{0-1186512031135618 like.
What's the matter? Doesn't Dick want anyone else to see
}{02186512031135618 you?'}{ 86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{0-1186512031135618 'Fill my glass, Norman,' said Georgette
sharply.}{86512031135618 }18210101010012200168 8 {01186512031135618
'Right away,' he said, not looking at her, 'Do you want one }{
0-1186512031135618 too, Liwy? I'll get you a glass.' He turned, and
everything hap-}{0-2186512031135618 pened at once.}{86512031135618
}1785005012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Livvy cried. 'Watch out!' She saw
it coming, even had a vague }{02186512031135618 feeling that all this
had happened before, but it played itself out inexorably. His heel
caught the edge of the carpet; he lurched, }{17186512031135618 tried to
right himself, and lost the cocktail shaker. It seemed }{
02186512031135618 to jump out of his hands, and a pint of ice-cold
liquor drenched }{15186512031135618 Livvy from shoulder to
hem.}{86512031135618 }1920000012200168 8 {02186512031135618 She stood
there, gasping. The noises muted about her, and for a few intolerable
moments she made futile brushing gestures at }{03186512031135618 her
gown, while Norman kept repeating, 'Damnation!' in rising }{
0-3186512031135618 tones.}{86512031135618 }1820550012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Georgette said coolly, 'It's too bad, Liwy. Just one
of those }{04186512031135618 things. I imagine the dress can't be very
expensive.'}{86512031135618 }1780000012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Livvy
turned and ran. She was in the bedroom, which was at }{16186512031135618
least empty and relatively quiet. By the light of the
fringe-}{03186512031135618 shaded lamp on the dresser, she poked among
the coats on the }{01186512031135618 bed, looking for her own.
}{86512031135618 }168055006556944 8 {19186512031135618 Norman had come
in behind her. 'Look, Livvy, don't pay }{16186512031135618 any attention

{18186512031135618 'That's all right. It wasn't your fault.' She blinked
rapidly }{04186512031135618 and didn't look at him. 'I'll just go home
and change.'}{86512031135618 }17800178012200168 8 {03186512031135618
'Are you coming back?'}{86512031135618 }{15186512031135618 'I don't

-}{86512031135618 }17300173012200168 8 {04186512031135618 - and the

{19186512031135618 Something }{19186512031135618 did }{
19186512031135618 go wrong with the time when she was in
}{15186512031135618 there - in the slab. It was deep twilight now. The
train lights }{ 02186512031135618 were on. But it didn't matter. She
seemed to be recovering from the wrench inside her.}{86512031135618
}16810101010012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Norman was rubbing his eyes

}{15186512031135618 stopped, then added slowly, 'It was as though I

didn't }{04186512031135618 want }{16186512031135618 to know what

it wouldn't matter. Nothing would matter. Her hands reached
}{16186512031135618 out and encircled his arm. She held it tightly, and
while she }{02186512031135618 held it she thought: 'Nothing in the
make-believe can take him }{03186512031135618 from me.'}{86512031135618
}17800178012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Norman said to the little man,

{15186512031135618 In the yellow light the process seemed to be slower.
Gently }{03186512031135618 the frosted slab cleared, like clouds being
torn apart and dis-persed by an unfelt wind.}{86512031135618
}1780550012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Norman was saying, 'There's

as we are now.'}{86512031135618 }173000006556944 8 {04186512031135618 He
was right. Two little figures were sitting in a train on the}{6556944 }{

was en-}{01186512031135618 larging now - they were merging into it.

}182345534012200168 8 {17186512031135618 Livvy was blindingly happy. She

fashion.}{86512031135618 }192385538012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Give a
Freudian cast of mind and sufficient ingenuity, it is }{186512031135618
possible, I think, to translate any collection of words (rational,
}{16186512031135618 irrational, or nonsensical) into sexual symbolism,
and then }{02186512031135618 prate learnedly about the writer's
unconscious.}{86512031135618 }18724141424012200168 8 {02186512031135618
I have said this before and I'll say it again. I don't know what }{

even know }{03186512031135618 for sure that I have one.}{86512031135618
}18714191914012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I am told that the contents

}{01186512031135618 study of those hidden mental factors under the

}18210191910012200168 8 {18186512031135618 Maybe so, but the only thing
about myself that I consider }{ 01186512031135618 to be severe enough to
warrant psychoanalytic treatment is my }{15186512031135618 compulsion to
write. Perhaps if I vacuumed my mentality and }{ 03186512031135618 got
rid of the compulsion, I could spend more time sleeping in the sun and
playing golf, or whatever it is that people do who have nothing better
to do.}{86512031135618 }17310383810012200168 8 {16186512031135618 But I

with a complete examination of my com-}{03186512031135618 pulsions and
hangups and neuroses and expect me to be,tear-}{ 02186512031135618 fully
grateful. I'm not in the market. Nor am I interested in the

keep them.}{ 86512031135618 }187048480012200168 8 {02186512031135618

{02186512031135618 Anyone reading 'Sally' can sense that I feel strongly

probably reflects some-}{02186512031135618 thing of my own life. Toward
the end of the story, in fact, Sally }{ 03186512031135618 does something
which will allow the amateur Freudian a field day. (Oh, find it for
yourself; it won't be hard.) The sexual }{186512031135618 sy mbolism is
blatant and the parlor psychoanalyst can chuckle }{02186512031135618

}{01186512031135618 you understand, but Sally's the prettiest one of the
lot. There }{186512031135618 just isn't any question about
it.}{86512031135618 }197010100012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 She moved
a little faster when I waved to her. Nothing undig-}{ 02186512031135618
nified. She was never that. She moved just enough faster to
}{0-2186512031135618 show that she was glad to see me,
too.}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 I turned
to the man standing beside me. 'That's Sally,' I said.}{86512031135618
}{186512031135618 He smiled at me and nodded.}{86512031135618
}182510105012200168 8 {186512031135618 Mrs. Hester had brought him in.
She said, 'This is Mr. Gell-}{0-1186512031135618 horn, Jake. You
remember he sent you the letter asking for an
appointment.'}{86512031135618 }{0-2186512031135618 That was just talk,
really. I have a million things to do around }{0-1186512031135618 the
Farm, and one thing I just can't waste my time on is mail. }{
02186512031135618 That's why I have Mrs. Hester around. She lives pretty
close by, she's good at attending to foolishness without running to
}{0-2186512031135618 me about it, and most of all, she likes Sally and
the rest. Some }{0-1186512031135618 people don't.}{86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {186512031135618 'Glad to see you, Mr. Gellhorn,' I
said.}{86512031135618 }17314141414012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618
'Raymond J, Gellhorn,' he said, and gave me his hand, which }{
0-2186512031135618 I shook and gave back.}{86512031135618
}17310001007997362 8 {186512031135618 He was a largish fellow, half a
head taller than I and wider, }{0-1186512031135618 too. He was about
half my age, thirtyish. He had black hair, }{0-2186512031135618
plastered down slick, with a part in the middle, and a thin mus-tache,
very neatly trimmed. His jawbones got big under his ears }{
15186512031135618 and made him look as if he had a slight case of mumps.
On}{7997362 }{04186512031135618 video he'd be a natural to play the
villain, so I assumed he was }{ 02186512031135618 a nice fellow. It goes
to show that video can't be wrong all the }{0-3186512031135618
time.}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'I'm Jacob
Folkers,' I said. 'What can I do for you?"}{86512031135618
}173519195012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He grinned. It was a big, wide,
white-toothed grin. 'You can tell me a little about your Farm here, if
you don't mind.'}{86512031135618 }182014140012200168 8
{15186512031135618 I heard Sally coming up behind me and I put out my
hand. }{03186512031135618 She slid right into it and the feel of the
hard, glossy enamel of her fender was warm in my palm.}{86512031135618
}17800178012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'A nice automatobile,' said
Gellhorn.}{86512031135618 }178010100012200168 8 {01186512031135618
That's one way of putting it. Sally was a 2045 convertible with }{
03186512031135618 a Hennis-Carleton positronic motor and an Armat
chassis. She had the cleanest, finest lines I've ever seen on any model,
bar none. For five years, she'd been my favorite, and I'd put every-
thing into her I could dream up. In all that time, there'd never been a
human being behind her wheel.}{86512031135618 }17800178012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Not once.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'Sally,' I said, patting her gently, 'meet Mr.
Gellhorn.'}{86512031135618 }1920000012200168 8 {02186512031135618
Sally's cylinder-purr keyed up a little. I listened carefully for }{
04186512031135618 any knocking. Lately, I'd been hearing motor-knock in
almost }{02186512031135618 all the cars and changing the gasoline hadn't
done a bit of good. Sally was as smooth as her paint job this time,
however.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Do you
have names for all your cars?' asked Gellhorn.}{86512031135618
}168510105012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He sounded amused, and Mrs.
Hester doesn't like people to sound as though they were making fun of
the Farm. She said, }{02186512031135618 sharply, 'Certainly. The cars
have real personalities, don't they, }{ 01186512031135618 Jake? The
sedans are all males and the convertibles are females.'}{86512031135618
}182510105012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Gellhorn was smiling again.
'And do you keep them in separ-ate garages, ma'am?'}{86512031135618

}18200182012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Mrs. Hester glared at
him.}{86512031135618 }17814141414012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Gellhorn
said to me, 'And now I wonder if I can talk to you }{ 03186512031135618
alone, Mr. Folkers?'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8
{15186512031135618 'That depends,' I said. 'Are you a
reporter?'}{86512031135618 }17819141419012200168 8 {01186512031135618
'No, sir. I'm a sales agent. Any talk we have is not for publica-}{
03186512031135618 tion. I assure you I am interested in strict
privacy.'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Let's
walk down the road a bit. There's a bench we can use.'}{86512031135618
}16819101019012200168 8 {04186512031135618 We started down. Mrs. Hester
walked away. Sally nudged }{01186512031135618 along after
us.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I said, 'You
don't mind if Sally comes along, do you?'}{86512031135618
}18219101019012200168 8 {01186512031135618 'Not at all. She can't repeat
what we say, can she?' He laughed }{ 02186512031135618 at his own joke,
reached over and rubbed Sally's grille.}{86512031135618
}18700187012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Sally raced her motor and
Gellhorn's hand drew away quickly.}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618
'She's not used to strangers,' I explained.}{86512031135618
}182014140012200168 8 {03186512031135618 We sat down on the bench under
the big oak tree where we }{02186512031135618 could look across the
small lake to the private speedway. It was the warm part of the day and
the cars were out in force, at least }{04186512031135618 thirty of them.
Even at this distance I could see that Jeremiah was pulling his usual
stunt of sneaking up behind some staid older model, then putting on a
jerk of speed and yowling past }{02186512031135618 with deliberately
squealing brakes. Two weeks before he had }{03186512031135618 crowded
old Angus off the asphalt altogether, and I had turned
}{02186512031135618 off his motor for two days.}{86512031135618
}18210101010012200168 8 {18186512031135618 It didn't help though, I'm
afraid, and it looks as though }{15186512031135618 there's nothing to be
done about it. Jeremiah is a sports model }{03186512031135618 to begin
with and that kind is awfully hot-headed.}{86512031135618
}182514145012200168 8 {01186512031135618 'Well, Mr. Gellhorn,' I said.
'Could you tell me why you want }{ 15186512031135618 the
information?'}{86512031135618 }187014140012200168 8 {02186512031135618
But he was just looking around. He said, 'This }{02186512031135618 is }{
02186512031135618 an amazing }{04186512031135618 place, Mr.
Folkers.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'I
wish you'd call me Jake. Everyone does.'}{86512031135618
}{03186512031135618 'All right, Jake. How many cars do you have
here?'}{86512031135618 }178510105012200168 8 {02186512031135618
'Fifty-one. We get one or two new ones every year. One year we got five.
We haven't lost one yet. They're all in perfect run-}{03186512031135618
ning order. We even have a '15 model Mat-O-Mot in working }{
02186512031135618 order. One of the original automatics. It was the
first car here.'}{86512031135618 }192510105012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Good old Matthew. He stayed in the garage most of the
day now, but then he was the granddaddy of all positronic-motored
}{02186512031135618 cars. Those were the days when blind war veterans,
paraplegics }{ 01186512031135618 and heads of state were the only ones
who drove automatics. But }{15186512031135618 Samson Harridge was my
boss and he was rich enough to be }{ 03186512031135618 able to get one.
I was his chauffeur at the time.}{86512031135618 }1870550012200168 8
{03186512031135618 The thought makes me feel old. I can remember when
there }{16186512031135618 wasn't an automobile in the world with brains
enough to find }{02186512031135618 its own way home. I chauffeured dead
lumps of machines that }{03186512031135618 needed a man's hand at their
controls every minute. Every year }{01186512031135618 machines like that
used to kill tens of thousands of people.}{86512031135618
}173100010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 The automatics fixed that. A
positronic brain can react much faster than a human one, of course, and
it paid people to keep }{16186512031135618 hands off the controls. You
got in, punched your destination }{ 03186512031135618 and let it go its
own way.}{86512031135618 }182500507997362 8 {16186512031135618 We take
it for granted now, but I remember when the first laws came out forcing
the old machines off the highways and }{7997362 }{03186512031135618
limiting travel to automatics. Lord, what a fuss. They called it
}{04186512031135618 everything from communism to fascism, but it emptied
the }{ 15186512031135618 highways and stopped the killing, and still
more people get }{02186512031135618 around more easily the new
way.}{86512031135618 }18710242410012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Of
course, the automatics were ten to a hundred times as ex-}{
16186512031135618 pensive as the hand-driven ones, and there aren't many
that }{02186512031135618 could afford a private vehicle. The industry
specialized in turn- ing out omnibus-automatics. You could always call a
company and have one stop at your door in a matter of minutes and take
}{04186512031135618 you where you wanted to go. Usually, you had to
drive with }{ 02186512031135618 others who were going your way, but
what's wrong with that?}{86512031135618 }18710292910012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Samson Harridge had a private car though, and I went
to him }{ 16186512031135618 the minute it arrived. The car wasn't
Matthew to me then. I }{15186512031135618 didn't know it was going to be
the dean of the Farm some day. }{ 02186512031135618 I only knew it was
taking my job away and I hated it.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{02186512031135618 I said, 'You won't be needing me any more, Mr.
Harridge?'}{86512031135618 }17324191924012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He
said, What are you dithering about, Jake? You don't think }{
16186512031135618 I'll trust myself to a contraption like that, do you?
You stay }{03186512031135618 right at the controls.'}{86512031135618
}18724191924012200168 8 {02186512031135618 I said, 'But it works by
itself, Mr. Harridge. It scans the road, }{ 03186512031135618 reacts
properly to obstacles, humans, and other cars, and
re-}{02186512031135618 members routes to travel.'}{86512031135618
}16838242438012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'So they say. So they say.
Just the same, you're sitting right behind the wheel in case anything
goes wrong.'}{ 86512031135618 }17834141434012200168 8 {03186512031135618
Funny how you can get to like a car. In no time I was calling }{
15186512031135618 it Matthew and was spending all my time keeping it
polished }{03186512031135618 and humming. A positronic brain stays in
condition best when }{ 01186512031135618 it's got control of its chassis
at all times, which means it's worth }{186512031135618 keeping the gas
tank filled so that the motor can turn over slowly }{ 03186512031135618
day and night. After a while, it got so I could tell by the sound of the
motor how Matthew felt.}{86512031135618 }216055007997362 8
{02186512031135618 In his own way, Harridge grew fond of Matthew, too.
He had no one else to like. He'd divorced or outlived three wives and
}{01186512031135618 outlived five children and three grandchildren. So
when he died, maybe it wasn't surprising that he had his estate
converted into a }{02186512031135618 Farm for Retired Automobiles, with
me in charge and Matthew the first member of a distinguished line.
}{86512031135618 }{15186512031135618 It's turned out to be my life. I
never got married. You can't }{01186512031135618 get married and still
tend to automatics the way you should.}{ 86512031135618 }245000007997362
8 {03186512031135618 The newspapers thought it was funny, but after a
while they }{01186512031135618 stopped joking about it. Some things you
can't joke about. Maybe you've never been able to afford an automatic
and maybe you }{03186512031135618 ne ver will, either, but take it from
me, you get to love them. They're hard-working and affectionate. It
takes a man with no heart to mistreat one or to see one
mistreated.}{7997362 }{18186512031135618 It got so that after a man had
an automatic for a while, he }{01186512031135618 would make provisions
for having it left to the Farm, if he didn't }{02186512031135618 have an
heir he could rely on to give it good care. }{04186512031135618 I
explained that to Gellhorn.}{86512031135618 }175500507997362 8
{15186512031135618 He said, 'Fifty-one cars! That represents a lot of
money.' }{16114890977 'Fifty thousand minimum }{16186512031135618 per
automatic, original invest-ment,' I said. 'The}{16114890977 y're worth a
lot more now. I've }{ 16186512031135618 done things }{04186512031135618
for them.'}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 'It must take a lot of
money to keep up the Farm.' }{0417997362 }{19186512031135618 'You're
right there. The Farm's a non-profit organization, }{03186512031135618
which gives us a break on taxes and, of course, new automatics }{
15186512031135618 that come in usually have trust funds attached. Still,
costs are }{17186512031135618 always going up. I have to keep the place
landscaped; I keep }{ 15186512031135618 laying down new asphalt and
keeping the old in repair; there's }{03186512031135618 gasoline, oil,
repairs, and new gadgets. It adds up.' }{ 0317997362 }{04186512031135618
'And you've spent a long time at it.' }{0417997362 }{15186512031135618
'I sure have, Mr. Gellhorn. Thirty-three years.' }{1517997362
}{03186512031135618 'You don't seem to be getting much out of it
yourself.' }{0317997362 }{18114890977 'I don't? }{18186512031135618 You
surprise me, Mr. Gellhorn. I've got Sally and }{04114890977 fifty
others. Look at }{ 04186512031135618 her.'}{86512031135618
}19714001407997362 8 {02186512031135618 I was grinning.I couldn't help
it. Sally was so clean, it almost }{ 17186512031135618 hurt. Some insect
must have died on her windshield or one }{04186512031135618 speck of
dust too many had landed, so she was going to work. }{ 15186512031135618
A little tube protruded and spurted Tergosol over the glass. It
}{186512031135618 spread quickly over the silicone surface film and
squeegees snap-}{ 01186512031135618 ped into place instantly, passing
over the windshield and forcing }{15186512031135618 the water into the
little channel that led it, dripping, down to }{ 02186512031135618 the
ground. Not a speck of water got on to her glistening
apple-}{16186512031135618 green hood. Squeegee and detergent tube
snapped back into }{ 02186512031135618 place and
disappeared.}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 Gellhorn said, 'I never
saw an automatic do that.' }{15186512031135618 'I guess not,' I said. 'I
fixed that up specially on our cars. }{ 04186512031135618 They're clean.
They're always scrubbing their glass. They like }{03186512031135618 it.
I've even got Sally fixed up with wax jets. She polishes her-}{
02186512031135618 self every night till you can see your face in any
part of her and shave by it. If I can scrape up the money, I'd be
putting it on the }{03186512031135618 rest of the girls. Convertibles
are very vain.'}{86512031135618 }18214383814012200168 8 {186512031135618

positronic motors. }{03186512031135618 I don't care which twenty-five
you choose. We'll load them on }{15186512031135618 the bus and take them
away. Once they're disposed of, I'll see }{03186512031135618 to it that
you get your fair share of the money.'}{86512031135618
}18700187012200168 8 {15186512031135618 'I have your word on that, I
suppose.'}{86512031135618 }16314242414012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He
didn't act as if he thought I was being sarcastic. He said,
}{186512031135618 'You have.' }{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8
{01186512031135618 I said, "No.'}{86512031135618 }17814141414012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'If you insist on saying no, we'll go about it in our
own way. I'll disconnect the motors myself, only I'll disconnect all
fifty-}{02186512031135618 one. Every one of them.'}{86512031135618
}18210141410012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'It isn't easy to disconnect
positronic motors, Mr. Gellhorn. Are you a robotics expert? Even if you
are, you know, these }{02186512031135618 motors have been modified by
me.'}{86512031135618 }17314101014012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'I know
that, Jake. And to be truthful, I'm not an expert. I }{
03186512031135618 may ruin quite a few motors trying to get them out.
That's why I'll have to work over all fifty-one if you don't cooperate.
You }{02186512031135618 see, I may only end up with twenty-five when I'm
through. The }{03186512031135618 first few I'll tackle will probably
suffer the most. Till I get the }{04186512031135618 hang of it, you see.
And if I go it myself, I think I'll put Sally }{02186512031135618 first
in line.'}{86512031135618 }20600206012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I
said, 'I can't believe you're serious, Mr. Gellhorn.'}{86512031135618
}17329101029012200168 8 {16186512031135618 He said, 'I'm serious, Jake.'
He let it all dribble in. 'If you }{ 03186512031135618 want to help, you
can keep Sally. Otherwise, she's liable to be hurt very badly.
Sorry.'}{86512031135618 }182345534012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I said,

trouble, Mr. Gellhorn.'}{ 86512031135618 }163580058012200168 8
{18186512031135618 He thought that was very funny. He was laughing very
}{02186512031135618 quietly as we went down the stairs
together.}{86512031135618 }230000008068929 8 {16186512031135618 There
was an automatobus waiting outside the driveway to}{8068929 }{
02186512031135618 the garage apartments. The shadows of three men waited
beside }{03186512031135618 it, and their flash beams went on as we
approached.}{86512031135618

}182529295012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Gellhorn said in a low voice,
'I've got the old fellow. Come on. Move the truck u p the drive and
let's get started.'}{86512031135618 }187524245012200168 8
{03186512031135618 One of the others leaned in and punched the proper
instruc-}{17186512031135618 tions on the control panel. We moved up the
driveway with }{01186512031135618 the bus following
submissively.}{86512031135618 }187019190012200168 8 {17186512031135618
'It won't go inside the garage,' I said. 'The door won't take }{
03186512031135618 it. We don't have buses here. Only private
cars.'}{86512031135618 }182514145012200168 8 {18186512031135618 'All
right,' said Gellhorn. 'Pull it over onto the grass and }{
03186512031135618 keep it out of sight.'}{86512031135618
}17314191914012200168 8 {16186512031135618 I could hear the thrumming of
the cars when we were still }{03186512031135618 ten yards from the
garage.}{86512031135618 }17810141410012200168 8 {03186512031135618
Usually they quieted down if I entered the garage. This time }{
15186512031135618 they didn't. I think they knew that strangers were
about, and }{02186512031135618 once the face of Gellhorn and the others
were visible they got noisier. Each motor was a warm rumble, and each
motor was }{03186512031135618 knocking irregularly until the place
rattled.}{86512031135618

}182010100012200168 8 {03186512031135618 The lights went up
automatically as we stepped inside. Gell-}{ 04186512031135618 horn
didn't seem bothered by the car noise, but the three men
}{16186512031135618 with him looked surprised and uncomfortable. They
had the }{ 04186512031135618 look of the hired thug about them, a look
that was not com-}{15186512031135618 pounded of physical features so
much as of a certain wariness }{ 03186512031135618 of eye and
hang-dogness of face. I knew the type and I wasn't }{01186512031135618
worried.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {04186512031135618 One of
them said, 'Damn it, they're burning gas.'}{86512031135618
}19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'My cars always do,' I replied
stiffly.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Not
tonight,' said Gellhorn. 'Turn them off.'}{86512031135618
}{15186512031135618 'It's not that easy, Mr. Gellhorn,' I
said.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Get
started!' he said.}{86512031135618 }182140014012200168 8
{16186512031135618 I stood there. He had his fist gun pointed at me
steadily. I }{ 15186512031135618 said, 'I told you, Mr. Gelhorn, that my
cars have been well-}{04186512031135618 treated while they've been at
the Farm. They're used to being }{ 03186512031135618 treated that way,
and they resent anything else.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'You have one minute,' he said. 'Lecture me some
other time.'}{86512031135618 }18214001408485737 8 {16186512031135618
'I'm trying to explain something. I'm trying to explain that
}{03186512031135618 my cars can understand what I say to them. A
positronic motor }{16186512031135618 will learn to do that with time and
patience. My cars have }{02186512031135618 learned. Sally understood
your proposition two days ago. You'll }{01186512031135618 remember she
laughed when I asked her opinion. She also knows}{8485737
}{16186512031135618 what you did to her and so do the two sedans you
scattered. }{02186512031135618 And the rest know what to do about
trespassers in general.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'Look, you crazy old fool -'}{86512031135618
}18700187012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'All I have to say is -' I
raised my voice. 'Get them!'}{86512031135618 }197010100012200168 8
{02186512031135618 One of the men turned pasty and yelled, but his voice
was }{17186512031135618 drowned completely in the sound of fifty-one
horns turned }{15186512031135618 loose at once. They held their notes,
and within the four walls }{01186512031135618 of the garage the echoes
rose to a wild, metallic call. Two cars }{15186512031135618 rolled
forward, not hurriedly, but with no possible mistake as
}{17186512031135618 to their target. Two cars fell in line behind the
first two. All }{03186512031135618 the cars were stirring in their
separate stalls.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618
The thugs stared, then backed.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{04186512031135618 I shouted, 'Don't get up against a
wall.'}{86512031135618 }17314141414012200168 8 {16186512031135618
Apparently, they had that instinctive thought themselves.
}{03186512031135618 They rushed madly for the door of the
garage.}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 At the door one of
Gellhorn's men turned, brought up a fist }{02186512031135618 gun of his
own. The needle pellet tore a thin, blue flash toward }{
04186512031135618 the first car. The car was Giuseppe.}{86512031135618
}17324141424012200168 8 {02186512031135618 A thin line of paint peeled
up Giuseppe's hood, and the right }{ 01186512031135618 half of his
windshield crazed and splintered but did not break
through.}{86512031135618 }17334101034012200168 8 {18186512031135618 The
men were out the door, running, and two by two the }{03186512031135618
cars crunched out after them into the night, their horns calling
}{186512031135618 the charge.}{86512031135618 }17838101038012200168 8
{17186512031135618 I kept my hand on Gellhorn's elbow, but I don't think
he }{02186512031135618 could have moved in any case. His lips were
trembling.}{86512031135618 }17843101043012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I
said, 'That's why I don't need electrified fences or guards. }{
03186512031135618 My property protects itself.'}{86512031135618
}17838101038012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Gellhorn's eyes swiveled back
and forth in fascination as, pair }{ 15186512031135618 by pair, they
whizzed by. He said, 'They're killers!'}{86512031135618
}22600226012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Don't be silly. They won't kill

'They'll just give your men a lesson. My cars have been
speci-}{03186512031135618 ally trained for cross-country pursuit for
just such an occasion; I think what your men will get will be worse than
an outright }{04186512031135618 quick kill. Have you ever been chased by
an automatobile?'}{ 86512031135618 }22600226012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Gellhorn didn't answer.}{86512031135618
}19724002408485737 8 {16186512031135618 I went on. I didn't want him to
miss a thing. 'They'll be }{03186512031135618 shadows going no faster
than your men, chasing them here, blocking them there, blaring at them,
dashing at them, missing }{04186512031135618 with a screech of brake and
a thunder of motor. They'll keep it}{ 8485737 }{03186512031135618 up
till your men drop, out of breath and half-dead, waiting for the wheels
to crunch over their breaking bones. The cars won't do that. They'll
turn away. You can bet, though, that your men }{04186512031135618 wi ll
never return here in their lives. Not for all the money you or ten like
you could give them. Listen -'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8
{04186512031135618 I tightened my hold on his elbow. He strained to
hear.}{86512031135618 }20600206012200168 8 {15186512031135618 I said,
'Don't you hear car doors slamming?'}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618
It was faint and distant, but unmistakable.}{86512031135618
}{04186512031135618 I said, 'They're laughing. They're enjoying
themselves.'}{86512031135618 }178145514012200168 8 {04186512031135618
His face crumpled with rage. He lifted his hand. He was still }{
02186512031135618 holding his fist gun.}{86512031135618
}20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I said, 'I wouldn't. One

{16186512031135618 I don't think he had noticed Sally till then. She had
moved }{03186512031135618 up so quietly. Though her right front fender
nearly touched me, }{15186512031135618 I couldn't hear her motor. She
might have.been holding her }{01186512031135618 breath.}{ 86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Gellhorn yelled.}{86512031135618
}178141413781414012200168 8 {19186512031135618 I said, 'She won't touch
you, as long as I'm with you. But}{1918485737 }{ 01186512031135618 if

}17810141410012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'All right, then,' he yelled,
and suddenly my arm was bent }{ 16186512031135618 behind my back and
twisted so I could hardly stand. He held }{04186512031135618 me between
Sally and himself, and his pressure didn't let up. }{ 17186512031135618
'Back out with me and don't try to break loose, old-tuner, or

stocket.'}{86512031135618 }17810242410012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I
had to move. Sally nudged along with us, worried, uncer-tain w hat to
do. I tried to say something to her and couldn't. I }{03186512031135618
could only clench my teeth and moan.}{86512031135618
}18210292910012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Gellhorn's automatobus was
still standing outside the garage. }{ 02186512031135618 I was forced in.

}18700187012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He said, 'All right, now. We'll
talk sense.'}{86512031135618 }187024240012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I
was rubbing my arm, trying to get life back into it, and
}{15186512031135618 even as I did I was automatically and without any
conscious }{03186512031135618 effort studying the control board of the
bus.}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I said,

{04186512031135618 'So?' he said caustically. 'It's a sample of my work.
I picked }{ 02186512031135618 up a discarded chassis, found a brain I
could use and spliced me }{04186512031135618 a private bus. What of
it?'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I tore at
the repair panel, forcing it aside.}{86512031135618 }173100010012200168
8 {03186512031135618 He said, 'What the hell. Get away from that.' The
side of his palm came down numbingly on my left shoulder.}{
86512031135618 }187105510012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I struggled with
him. 'I don't want to do this bus any harm. }{ 17186512031135618 What
kind of a person do you think I am? I just want to take

connections.'}{86512031135618 }1875005012200168 8 {03186512031135618 It
didn't take much of a look. I was boiling when I turned to him. I said,
"You're a hound and a bastard. You had no right }{04186512031135618
installing this motor yourself. Why didn't you get a robotics }{
15186512031135618 man?'}{86512031135618 }17800178012200168 8
{04186512031135618 He said, 'Do I look crazy?'}{86512031135618
}1825555012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Even if it was a stolen motor,
you had no right to treat it so. }{ 03186512031135618 I wouldn't treat a
man the way you treated that motor. Solder, }{16186512031135618 tape,
and pinch clamps! It's brutal!'}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8
{15186512031135618 'It works, doesn't it?'}{86512031135618
}1820550012200168 8 {18186512031135618 'Sure it works, but it must be

much of a life. This car is }{03186512031135618
suffering.'}{86512031135618

}1785555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Shut up!' For a moment he
glanced out the window at Sally, }{16186512031135618 who had rolled up
as close to the bus as she could. He made }{02186512031135618 sure the
door and windows were locked.}{86512031135618 }16810141410012200168 8
{02186512031135618 He said, 'We're getting out of here now, before the

away.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'How will
that help you?'}{86512031135618 }1780550012200168 8 {16186512031135618
'Your cars will run out of gas someday, won't they? You haven't got them
fixed up so they can tank tip on their own, }{03186512031135618 have

}178514145012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'They'll be looking for me,' I
said. 'Mrs. Hester will call the }{ 0-1186512031135618
police.'}{86512031135618 }168190019012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He was
past reasoning with. He just punched the bus in gear. }{
02186512031135618 It lurched forward. Sally followed.
}{04186512031135618 , He giggled. 'What can she do if you're here with
me?'}{86512031135618 }192140014012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Sally
seemed to realize that, too. She picked up speed, passed }{
02186512031135618 us and was gone. Gellhorn opened the window next to
him and spat through the opening.}{86512031135618 }178190019012200168 8
{03186512031135618 The bus lumbered on over the dark road, its motor
rattling unevenly. Gellhorn dimmed the periphery light until the
}{02186512031135618 phosphorescent green stripe down the middle of the
highway, }{ 01186512031135618 sparkling in the moonlight, was all that
kept us out of the trees. }{02186512031135618 There was virtually no
traffic. Two cars passed ours, going the }{ 01186512031135618 other way,
and there was none at all on our side of the highway,
}{02186512031135618 either before or behind.}{86512031135618
}17853292953012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I heard the door-slamming
first. Quick and sharp in the }{03186512031135618 silence, first on the
right and then on the left. Gellhorn's hands }{186512031135618 quivered
as he punched savagely for increased speed. A beam of
}{15186512031135618 light shot out from among a scrub of trees, blinding
us. Ano-}{17186512031135618 ther beam plunged at us from behind the
guard rails on the }{04186512031135618 other side. At a crossover, four
hundred yards ahead, there was }{03186512031135618 a sque-e-e-e-e as a
car darted across our path.}{86512031135618 }25000250012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'Sally went for the rest,' I said.
}{04186512031135618 !}{ 04186512031135618 I think you're
surrounded.'}{86512031135618 }24500245012200168 8 {15186512031135618 'So
what? What can they do?'}{86512031135618 }16872191972012200168 8
{16186512031135618 He hunched over the controls, peering through the
wind-}{0-3186512031135618 shield.}{86512031135618 }25000250012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'And don't }{04186512031135618 you }{
04186512031135618 try anything, old-timer,' he muttered.}{86512031135618
}18762141462012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I couldn't. I was bone-weary;
my left arm was on fire. The }{ 02186512031135618 motor sounds gathered
and grew closer. I could hear the motors }{19186512031135618 missing in
odd patterns; suddenly it seemed to me that my }{ 02186512031135618 cars
were speaking to one another.}{86512031135618 }18262242462012200168 8
{03186512031135618 A medley of horns came from behind. I turned and
Gellhorn }{02186512031135618 looked quickly into the rear-view mirror. A
dozen cars were following in both lanes.}{86512031135618
}25900259012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Gellhorn yelled and laughed
madly.}{86512031135618 }25400254012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I cried,
'Stop! Stop the car!'}{86512031135618 }17872191972012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Because not a quarter of a mile ahead, plainly
visible in the light beams of two sedans on the roadside was Sally, her
trim }{04186512031135618 body plunked square across the road. The cars
shot into the }{02186512031135618 opposite lane to our left, keeping
perfect time with us and pre-}{04186512031135618 venting Gellhorn from
turning out.}{86512031135618 }17382191982012200168 8 {04186512031135618
But he had no intention of turning out. He put his finger on }{
03186512031135618 the full-speed-ahead button and kept it
there.}{86512031135618 }18272141472012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He
said, 'There'll be no bluffing here. This bus outweighs her }{
15186512031135618 five to one, old-timer, and we'll just push her off
the road like }{03186512031135618 a dead kitten.'}{86512031135618
}18777101077012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I knew he could. The bus was
on manual and his finger was on the button. I knew he would.}{
86512031135618 }163960096012200168 8 {16186512031135618 I lowered the
window, and stuck my head out. 'Sally,' I }{15186512031135618 screamed.
'Get out of }{151106390231135618 way. }{151106390231135618
Sally!'}{15186512031135618 the }{86512031135618 }173910091012200168 8
{02186512031135618 It was drowned out in the agonized squeal of
maltreated brake-bands. I felt myself thrown forward and heard
Gellhorn's breath puff out of his body.}{86512031135618
}17396009608485737 8 {04186512031135618 I saidj 'What happened?' It was
a foolish question. We had }{15186512031135618 stopped. That was what
had happened. Sally and the bus were}{8485737 }{02186512031135618 five
feet apart. With five times her weight tearing down on her,
}{04186512031135618 she had not budged. The guts of her.}{86512031135618
}18710101010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Gellhorn yanked at the Manual
toggle switch. 'It's got to,' he }{ 04186512031135618 kept muttering.
'It's got to.'}{86512031135618 }173105510012200168 8 {17186512031135618
I said, 'Not the way you hooked up the motor, expert. Any
}{02186512031135618 of the circuits could cross over.'}{86512031135618
}1820000012200168 8 {17186512031135618 He looked at me with a tearing
anger and growled deep in }{03186512031135618 his throat. His hair was
matted over his forehead. He lifted his }{-1-5186512031135618
fist.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'That's
all the advice out of you there'll ever be, old-timer.'}{86512031135618
}{03186512031135618 And I knew the needle gun was about to
fire.}{86512031135618 }1780550012200168 8 {15186512031135618 I pressed
back against the bus door, watching the fist come }{03186512031135618
up, and when the door opened I went over backward and out,
}{15186512031135618 hitting the ground with a thud. I heard the door
slam closed }{-1-5186512031135618 again.}{ 86512031135618
}1820550012200168 8 {16186512031135618 I got to my knees and looked up
in time to see Gellhorn }{15186512031135618 struggle uselessly with the
closing window, then aim his fist }{01186512031135618 gun quickly
through the glass. He never fired. The bus got under }{04186512031135618
way with a tremendous roar, and Gellhorn lurched
backward.}{86512031135618 }182014140012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Sally
wasn't in the way any longer, and I watched the bus's
}{02186512031135618 rear lights flicker away down the
highway.}{86512031135618 }182010100012200168 8 {02186512031135618 I was
exhausted. I sat down right there, right on the highway, }{
03186512031135618 and put my head down in my crossed arms, trying to
catch my }{186512031135618 breath.}{86512031135618 }16319101019012200168
8 {02186512031135618 I heard a car stop gen tly at my side. When I
looked up, it was Sally. Slowly - lovingly, you might say - her front
door opened.}{86512031135618 }16810101010012200168 8 {02186512031135618
No one had driven Sally for five years - except Gellhorn, of course -
and I know how valuable such freedom was to a car. I }{04186512031135618
appreciated the gesture, but I said, 'Thanks, Sally, but I'll take }{
02186512031135618 one of the newer cars.'}{86512031135618
}18210101010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 I got up and turned away, but
skillfully and neatly as a pirou-}{ 04186512031135618 ette, she wheeled
before me again. I couldn't hurt her feelings. }{02186512031135618 I got
in. Her front seat had the fine, fresh scent of an automato-}{
01186512031135618 bile that kept itself spotlessly clean. I lay down
across it, thank-}{03186512031135618 fully, and with even, silent, and
rapid efficiency, my boys and }{ 02186512031135618 girls brought me
home.}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Mrs.
Hester brought me the copy of the radio transcript the
}{02186512031135618 next evening with great excitement.}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'It's Mr. Gellhorn,' she said.
'The man who came to see you.' '}{04186512031135618 What about
him?'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I dreaded
her answer.}{86512031135618 }178514145012200168 8 {17186512031135618
'They found him dead,' she said. 'Imagine that. Just lying
}{15186512031135618 dead in a ditch.'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168
8 {15186512031135618 'It might be a stranger,' I
mumbled.}{86512031135618 }182510105012200168 8 {18186512031135618
'Raymond J. Gellhorn,' she said, sharply. 'There can't be
}{04186512031135618 two, can there? The description fits, too. Lord,
what a way to }{17186512031135618 die? They found tire marks on his arms
and body. Imagine! }{15186512031135618 I'm glad it turned out to be a
bus; otherwise they might have }{03186512031135618 come poking around
here.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Did it
happen near here?' I asked, anxiously.}{86512031135618
}18210101010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'No ... Near Cooksville. But,
goodness, read about it yourself }{ 16186512031135618 if you - What
happened to Giuseppe?'}{86512031135618 }1970550012200168 8
{01186512031135618 I welcomed the diversion. Giuseppe was waiting
patiently for }{04186512031135618 me to complete the repaint job. His
windshield had been re-}{0-1186512031135618 placed.}{86512031135618
}17810101010012200168 8 {17186512031135618 After she left, I snatched up
the transcript. There was no }{ 16186512031135618 doubt about it. The
doctor reported he had been running and }{03186512031135618 was in a
state of totally spent exhaustion. I wondered for how }{
02186512031135618 many miles the bus had played with him before the
final lunge. }{04186512031135618 The transcript had no notion of
anything like that, of course.}{ 86512031135618 }17314141414012200168 8
{03186512031135618 They had located the bus and identified it by the
tire tracks. }{ 04186512031135618 The police had it and were trying to
trace its ownership.}{86512031135618 }178105510012200168 8
{04186512031135618 There was an editorial in the transcript about it. It
had been }{ 02186512031135618 the first traffic fatality in the state
for that year, and the paper }{03186512031135618 warned strenuously
against manual driving after night.}{ 86512031135618 }178145514012200168
8 {04186512031135618 There was no mention of Gellhorn's three thugs and
for that, at least, I was g rateful. None of our cars had been seduced
by }{02186512031135618 the pleasure of the chase into
killing.}{86512031135618 }18210101010012200168 8 {316186512031135618
That was all. I let the paper drop. Gellhorn had been
}{03186512031135618 a criminal. His treatment of the bus had been
brutal. There was no question in my mind he deserved death. But still I
felt a bit queasy over the manner of it.}{86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {03186512031135618 A month has passed now and I
can't get it out of my mind.}{86512031135618 }178140014012200168 8
{15186512031135618 My cars talk to one another. I have no doubt about it
any-}{18186512031135618 more. It's as though they've gained confidence;
as though }{02186512031135618 they're not bothering to keep it a secret
anymore. Their engines }{03186512031135618 rattle and knock
continuously.}{86512031135618 }182140014012200168 8 {02186512031135618
And they don't talk among themselves only. They talk to the
}{03186512031135618 cars and buses that come into the Farm on business.
How long have they been doing that?}{86512031135618 }1920000014890977 8
{19186512031135618 They must be understood, too. Gellhorn's bus
understood}{14890977 }{ 16186512031135618 them, for all it hadn't been
on the grounds more than an hour. }{01186512031135618 I can close my
eyes and bring back that dash along the highway, }{ 15186512031135618
with our cars flanking the bus on either side, clacking their
}{04186512031135618 motors at it till it understood, stopped, let me
out, and ran off }{ 212186512031135618 with Gellhorn. }{86512031135618
}{02186512031135618 Did my cars tell him to kill Gellhorn? Or was that
his idea?}{86512031135618 }17310292910012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Can
}{15186512031135618 cars have such ideas? The motor designers say no but
}{02186512031135618 they mean under ordinary conditions. Have they
foreseen }{02186512031135618 every-}{ 0-1186512031135618
thing?}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Cars get
ill-used, you know.}{86512031135618 }182529295012200168 8
{17186512031135618 Some }{17186512031135618 of them enter the Farm and
observe. They get told }{ 03186512031135618 things. They find out that
cars exist whose motors are never }{04186512031135618 stopped, whom no
one ever drives, whose every need is sup-}{ 0-2186512031135618
plied.}{86512031135618 }16819141419012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Then
maybe they go out and tell others. Maybe the word is }{03186512031135618
spreading quickly. Maybe they're going to think that the Farm
}{04186512031135618 way should be the way all over the world. They don't
under-stand. You couldn't expect them to understand about legacies }{
03186512031135618 and the whims of rich men.}{86512031135618
}17334141434012200168 8 {03186512031135618 There are millions of
automobiles on Earth, tens of millions. If the thought gets rooted in
them that they're slaves; that they }{02186512031135618 should do
something about it ... If they begin to think the way }{
18186512031135618 Gellhorn's bus did....}{86512031135618
}17329101029012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Maybe it won't be till after
my time. And then they'll have to }{ 01186512031135618 keep a few of us
to take care of them, won't they? They wouldn't }{186512031135618 kill
us all.}{86512031135618 }173380038012200168 8 {16186512031135618 And
maybe they would. Maybe they wouldn't understand }{03186512031135618
about how someone would have to care for them. Maybe they
}{01186512031135618 won't wait.}{86512031135618 }22100221012200168 8
{16186512031135618 Every morning I wake up and think, Maybe
today....}{86512031135618 }168535553012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I
don't get as much pleasure out of my cars as I used to. Lately, }{

{01186512031135618 In late 1949, a new magazine appeared on the

}{15186512031135618 F & SF }{ 15186512031135618 daunting at first. It
stressed style, it seemed }{01186512031135618 to me, even more than
idea, and I wasn't at all sure that I could }{ 04186512031135618 manage
style, or that I even knew what style might be. It was
}{03186512031135618 only a few months ago, indeed, that a reviewer,
referring to me }{ 02186512031135618 in her review of one of my books,
said, 'He is no stylist.' I wrote at once to ask what a stylist was, but
she never answered, so it }{03186512031135618 looks as though I'll never
find out.}{86512031135618 }182190019012200168 8 {16186512031135618 As it
happened, though, Anthony Boucher, the co-editor of }{186512031135618
the magazine, wrote me a letter after the appearance of
'Hostess}{186512031135618 1 }{17186512031135618 - the first
communication on record between us. In 'Hostess,' }{ 02186512031135618 I
had spoken of the 'the paler emotional surges of the late
thir-}{19186512031135618 ties' and Tony wrote in mild expostulation,
having himself }{ 04186512031135618 just turned forty at the time.
}{04186512031135618 (}{04186512031135618 I}{04186512031135618 }{
04186512031135618 had just turned thirty.) He told }{01186512031135618
me that I had a delightful surprise ahead of me, and he was en-}{
02186512031135618 tirely right.}{86512031135618 }206105510012200168 8
{04186512031135618 This initiated a pleasant correspondence and I lost
some of my fear of }{ 04186512031135618 F & SF. }{04186512031135618 I
thought I would try a story that stressed }{16186512031135618 style but
since I didn't (either then or now) know what style }{01186512031135618
was, or how one went about getting it, I hadn't the faintest idea
}{17186512031135618 whether I had succeeded or not. I guess I did,
though, for it }{03186512031135618 was 'Flies' I wrote and Mr. Boucher
accepted and published it.}{86512031135618 }182510105012200168 8
{15186512031135618 I had no way of telling it at the time, but this
began what }{186512031135618 turned out to be the happiest of all my
associations with science }{15186512031135618 fiction magazines. I have
no complaints about }{15186512031135618 Astounding, }{ 186512031135618
Galaxy, }{186512031135618 or any of the rest, heaven knows, but
}{186512031135618 F & SF }{186512031135618 has become }{
02186512031135618 something special to me, and it is only honest of me
to say so.}{86512031135618 }178514145012200168 8 {01186512031135618 By
the way, if anyone thinks I am so arrogant that I can never accept any
editorial correction, he is quite wrong. I don't enjoy editorial
correction (no writer does) but I accept it quite often.
}{02186512031135618 (This, actually, is intended for my brother, who is
a newspaper editor and who seems to think that all writers are
fiendishly }{03186512031135618 anti-editor out of sheer malevolent
stupidity.)}{ 86512031135618 }178019190012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Anyway, here is my example of how sweetly compliant I can }{
17186512031135618 be. When I first wrote 'Flies', I named it 'King Lear,
IV, i, }{02186512031135618 36-37.' Mr. Boucher wrote me, somewhat in
horror, and asked if }{ 04186512031135618 I insisted on the title
because nobody would look it up and it }{02186512031135618 would be
meaningless.}{86512031135618 }173340034012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I
thought it over and decided he was right and renamed the }{
02186512031135618 story 'Flies'. After you read the story, however,
}{02186512031135618 you're }{02186512031135618 welcome }{
04186512031135618 to look it up. You'll find out what started the train

was Casey, }{ 15186512031135618 bitter ex-man of the campus! Polen could
see that in the way }{02186512031135618 his finger tips moved aimlessly

certainty he }{16186512031135618 would never find. It was all there in
the quick smile he never}{15554355 }{ 02186512031135618 entirely
abandoned, as though he feared there would be nothing
}{16186512031135618 to take its place, that its absence would turn his

quivering, into the present.}{86512031135618 }182510105012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Polen tried it. He said, 'Are you still working in

}1825555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'In my own way, yes,' said Casey,
gruffly. 'I'm not the scien-}{ 17186512031135618 tist you're considered
to be. I do research on insecticides for }{15186512031135618 E. J. Link

}1825555012200168 8 {18186512031135618 Casey said, 'Can't get rid of

that he was joking, that he forgave past }{186512031135618
grudges.}{86512031135618 }178519195012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Damn,

something in your body odor, Casey. You could be a boon to
}{03186512031135618 science. Find but the nature of the odorous
chemical, concen-}{15186512031135618 trate it, mix it with DDT, and

}173010100012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Winthrop frowned and said with
a faint flavor of rhetoric, }{01186512031135618 'Beauty is not the only

}187010100012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Casey did not deign a direct

{04186512031135618 'It amounts to a pun,' said Winthrop. 'The ancient
Hebrews }{15186512031135618 used it as one of their many terms of

instantly. He held out a hand,, with which to pump Polen's. He was
always conscientiously eager to rejoice }{03186512031135618 in another's
good fortune. Casey often pointed that out.}{86512031135618
}16834191934012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Casey said, 'Cybernetics

now?}{86512031135618 }16814141414015554355 8 {04186512031135618 Polen

reason or }{03186512031135618 intellect. It's practic ally a truism, I
suppose. You can't tell what a baby thinks or even }{03186512031135618
if }{03186512031135618 it thinks, but it's perfectly obvious
that}{15554355 }{ 02186512031135618 it can be angry, frightened or

circumstances.'}{ 86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {04186512031135618

}1925005012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'I don't know yet. Right now, all
I can say is that emotions }{01186512031135618 are universals. Now
suppose we could properly analyze all the }{15186512031135618 actions of
men and certain familiar animals and equate them }{02186512031135618
with the visible emotion. We might find a tight relationship.

could }{01186512031135618 apply it to animals whose emotions we couldn't

triumph.}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8 {04186512031135618 He
went on. 'Go ahead, Johnny. I'll contribute the flies and }{

a basic necessity.}{86512031135618 }1870000015554355 8
{15186512031135618 Polen knew. His machines had by-passed the screen of

mother. For that matter, the }{04186512031135618 cat and the mouse or
the snake and the bird. The data rattled }{18186512031135618 together in
its universality and it had all poured into and }{01186512031135618
through Polen until he could no longer bear the touch of

instantly, 'How }{ 16186512031135618 would you summarize your first

even say that to an ant, }{01186512031135618 an anteater is a higher

would move among them like an unseen, inexplicable
whirl-}{19186512031135618 wind, visiting them with destruction and
death. But that }{03186512031135618 wouldn't spoil things for the ants.

even know he was a deity. Or care.'}{86512031135618 }{02186512031135618
Winthrop had gone white. He said, 'I know you're saying this

your soul for a moment's amusement. Let me tell you this,' his voice
}{17186512031135618 trembled a little, 'and let me say it very
seriously. The flies }{ 15186512031135618 that torment you are your
punishment in this life. Beelzebub, }{04186512031135618 like all the
forces of evil, may think he does evil, but it's only }{
15186512031135618 the ultimate good after all. The curse of Beelzebub is
on you }{02186512031135618 for }{02186512031135618 your }{

}18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 He ran from the
room.}{86512031135618 }1825555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Casey
watched him go. He said, laughing, 'I told you Win-}{04186512031135618
throp believed in Beelzebub. It's funny the respectable names you can
give to superstition.' His laughter died a little short of its natural
end.}{86512031135618 }178105510012200168 8 {02186512031135618 There were

him.}{86512031135618 }1825005012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Polen rose
and left in heavy depression. One year had taught }{03186512031135618
him little, but it was already too much, and his laughter was
}{02186512031135618 thinning. Only his machines could analyze the
emotions of ani-mals properly, but he was already guessing too deeply
concern-}{ 03186512031135618 ing the emotions of men.}{86512031135618
}173100010012200168 8 {01186512031135618 He did not like to witness wild
murder-yearnings where others }{ 03186512031135618 could see only a few
words of unimportant quarrel.}{86512031135618 }182100010012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Casey said, suddenly, 'Say, come to think of it, you
did try }{ 03186512031135618 some of my flies, the way Winthrop says.
How about that?'}{86512031135618 }18210101010012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'Did I? after twenty years, I scarcely remember,'
murmured }{186512031135618 Polen.}{ 86512031135618 }182019190012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Winthrop said, 'You must. We were in your laboratory
and }{02186512031135618 you complained that Casey's flies followed him
even there. He }{03186512031135618 suggested you analyze them and you
did. You recorded their }{17186512031135618 motions and buzzings and
wing-wiping for half an hour or }{02186512031135618 more. You played
with a dozen different flies.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Polen shrugged.}{86512031135618 }18214191914012200168
8 {03186512031135618 'Oh, well,' said Casey. 'It doesn't matter. It was
good seeing you, old man.' The hearty hand-shake, the thump on the
shoul-}{15186512031135618 der, the broad grin - to Polen it all
translated into sick disgust }{ 03186512031135618 on Casey's part that
Polen was a 'success' after all.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Polen said, 'Let me hear from you
sometimes.'}{86512031135618 }18214141414012200168 8 {16186512031135618
The words were dull thumps. They meant nothing. Casey
}{15186512031135618 knew that. Polen knew that. Everyone knew that. But
words }{04186512031135618 were meant to hide emotion and when they
failed, humanity }{02186512031135618 loyally maintained the
pretense.}{86512031135618 }18219191919012200168 8 {16186512031135618
Winthrop's grasp of the hand was gentler. He said, 'This
}{01186512031135618 brought back old times, Polen. If you're ever in
Cincinnati, why }{02186512031135618 don't you stop in at the
meeting-house? You'll always be wel-}{0-1186512031135618 come.'}{
86512031135618 }18224191924012200168 8 {01186512031135618 To Polen, it
all bre athed of the man's relief at Polen's obvious depression.
Science, too, it seemed, was not the answer, and }{03186512031135618
Winthrop's basic and ineradicable insecurity felt pleased at the }{
0-2186512031135618 company.}{86512031135618 }17829141429012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'I will,' said Polen. It was the usual polite way of
saying, I }{186512031135618 won't.}{ 86512031135618 }21100211012200168 8
{02186512031135618 He watched them thread separately to other,
groups.}{86512031135618 }17329101029012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Winthrop would never know. Polen was sure of that. He
}{01186512031135618 wondered if Casey knew. It would be the supreme joke
if Casey }{02186512031135618 did not.}{86512031135618
}17338101038012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He }{02186512031135618 had }{
02186512031135618 run Casey's flies, of course, not that once alone, but
}{01186512031135618 many times. Always the same answer! Always the same

}173485548012200168 8 {02186512031135618 With a cold shiver he could not
quite control, Polen was sud-}{ 01186512031135618 denly conscious of a
single fly loose in the room, veering aim-}{02186512031135618 lessly for
a moment, then beating strongly and reverently in the direction Casey
had taken a moment before.}{86512031135618 }182580058012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Could Casey }{01186512031135618 not }{
01186512031135618 know? Could it be the essence of the primal
}{03186512031135618 punishment that he never learn he was

}38585838012200168 8 {186512031135618 I suppose that one of those stock
phrases for which everyone is }{03186512031135618 responsible at one
time or another is: 'Well, whatever does he }{186512031135618 see in

{16186512031135618 It's a ridiculous question because the sort of thing
that he }{ 01186512031135618 sees in her or she sees in him that isn't
visible to the general }{03186512031135618 population is probably

{04186512031135618 Just the same, I'm as prone to sneer as the next
fellow and }{ 03186512031135618 when I see a movie in which the girl
falls in love with a fellow }{186512031135618 who has no visible
advantages outside of being tall, lean, strong, }{ 01186512031135618
fearless, and incredibly handsome, I am naturally disgusted.
}{03186512031135618 'Whatever does she see in him?' I
ask.}{86512031135618 }17358242458012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Pressed
for a reason for the sneer, I can point out that this tall, lean,
strong, fearless, and incredibly handsome fellow almost invariably has
the brain capacity of a gnat. He speaks }{186512031135618 in an
occasional grunt and views the world with dim eyes backed by a
lackluster brain. He is known to all and sundry, and
par-}{03186512031135618 ticularly to the girl who is trying to mask her
mad passion for }{ 186512031135618 him, as a 'big lug', or, possibly, as
a 'big galoot'.}{86512031135618 }19267242467012200168 8 {186512031135618
These lugs or galoots are particularly impervious to even

we got out of uniform, Cliff and I have been work-}{02186512031135618
ing on calculating machines. You know what they are. Norbert
}{15186512031135618 Wiener popularized them in his book,
}{15186512031135618 Cybernetics. }{ 15186512031135618 If you've
}{03186512031135618 seen pictures of them, you know that they're great
big things. }{02186512031135618 They take up a whole wall and they're
very complicated; also }{0-3186512031135618 expensive.}{86512031135618
}1735555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 But Cliff and I had ideas. You
see, what makes a thinking }{02186512031135618 machine so big and"
expensive is that it has to be full of relays and vacuum tubes just so
that microscopic electric currents can }{04186512031135618 be controlled
and made to flicker on and off, here and there. }{ 15186512031135618 Now
the really important things are those little electric
cur-}{03186512031135618 rents, so -}{86512031135618
}17810101010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I once said to Cliff, 'Why
can't we control the currents with-out all the salad dressing?'}{
86512031135618 }17314101014012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Cliff said,
'Why not, indeed,' and started working on the }{ 0-2186512031135618
mathematics.}{86512031135618 }17810101010012200168 8 {01186512031135618
How we got where we did in two years is no matter. It's what }{
16186512031135618 we got after we finished that made the trouble. It
turned out }{15186512031135618 that we ended with something about this
high and maybe so }{ 04186512031135618 wide and just about this deep
-}{86512031135618 }17314101014012200168 8 {01186512031135618 No, no. I
forget that you can't see me. I'll give you the figures. }{
04186512031135618 It was about three feet high, six feet long, and two
feet deep. }{03186512031135618 Got that? It took two men to carry it but
it could be carried and }{ 16186512031135618 that was the point. And
still, mind you, it could do anything }{01186512031135618 the wall-size
calculators could. Not as fast, maybe, but we were }{ 0-2186512031135618
still working.}{86512031135618 }102900090011732623 8 {01186512031135618
We had big ideas about that thing, the very biggest. We could}{11732623
}{ 04186512031135618 put it on ships or airplanes, After a while, if we
could make it }{02186512031135618 small enough, an automobile could
carry one.}{86512031135618

}182524245012200168 8 {02186512031135618 We were especially interested
in the automobile angle. Sup-}{01186512031135618 pose you had a little
thinking machine on the dashboard, hooked }{02186512031135618 to the
engine and battery and equipped with photo-electric eyes.
}{04186512031135618 It cou ld choose an ideal course, avoid cars, stop
at red lights, }{03186512031135618 pick the optimum speed for the
terrain. Everybody could sit in the back seat and automobile accidents
would vanish.}{ 86512031135618 }182019190012200168 8 {16186512031135618
All of it was fun. There was so much excitement to it, so
}{04186512031135618 many thrills every time we worked out another
consolidation, }{03186512031135618 that I could still cry when I think
of the time I picked up the }{04186512031135618 telephone to call our
lab and tumbled everything into the dis-}{186512031135618
card.}{86512031135618 }18710242410012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I was
at Mary Ann's house that evening - Or have I told you }{
15186512031135618 about Mary Ann yet? No. I guess I
haven't.}{86512031135618 }18210242410012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mary
Ann was the girl who would have been my fiancee but }{02186512031135618
for two ifs. One, if she were willing, and two, if I had the nerve
}{04186512031135618 to ask her. She has red hair and crams something
like two tons }{03186512031135618 of energy into about 110 pounds of
body which fills out very }{15186512031135618 nicely from the ground to
five and a half feet up. I was dying }{16186512031135618 to ask her, you
understand, but each time I'd see her coming }{15186512031135618 into
sight, setting a match to my heart with every movement,
}{04186512031135618 I'd just break down.}{ 86512031135618
}18214101014012200168 8 {15186512031135618 It's not that I'm not
good-looking. People tell me I'm ade-}{ 03186512031135618 quate. I've
got all my hair; I'm nearly six feet tall; I can even
}{17186512031135618 dance. It's just that I've nothing to offer. I don't
have to tell }{ 03186512031135618 you what college teachers make. With
inflation and taxes, it amounts to just about nothing. Of course, if we
got the basic }{15186512031135618 patents rolled up on our little
thinking machine, things would }{02186512031135618 be different. But I
couldn't ask her to wait for that, either. May-}{04186512031135618 be,
after it was all set -}{86512031135618 }16819242419012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Anyway, I just stood there, wishing, that evening, as
she came into the living room. My arm was groping blindly for the
phone.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Mary Ann
said, 'I'm all ready, Bill. Let's go.'}{86512031135618
}21100211012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I said, 'Just a minute. I want
to ring up Cliff.'}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 She frowned a
little, 'Can't it wait?'}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 'I was
supposed to call him two hours ago,' I explained.}{86512031135618
}187240024011731217 8 {04186512031135618 It only took two minutes. I
rang the lab. Cliff was putting in }{ 16186512031135618 an evening of
work and so he answered. I asked something, }{04186512031135618 then he
said something, I asked some more and he explained. }{ 16186512031135618
The details don't matter, but as I said, he's the
mathematician}{11731217 }{03186512031135618 of the combination. When I
build the circuits and put things }{ 02186512031135618 together in What
look like impossible ways, he's the guy who shuffles the symbols and
tells me whether they're really impos-}{04186512031135618 sible. Then,
just as I finished and hung up, there was a ring at }{02186512031135618
the door.}{86512031135618 }178014140012200168 8 {03186512031135618 For a
minute, I thought Mary Ann had another caller and got
}{02186512031135618 sort of stiff-backed as I watched her go to the
door. I was scrib-}{01186512031135618 bling down some of what Cliff had
just told me while I watched. }{15186512031135618 But then she opened
the door and it was only Cliff Anderson }{186512031135618 after
all.}{86512031135618 }16810101010012200168 8 {19186512031135618 He said,
'I thought I'd find you here - Hello, Mary Ann. }{02186512031135618 Say,
weren't you going to ring me at six? You're as reliable as a
}{16186512031135618 cardboard chair.' Cliff is short and plump and
always willing }{04186512031135618 to start a fight, but I know him and
pay no attention.}{86512031135618 }17319141419012200168 8
{04186512031135618 I said, 'Things turned up and it slipped my mind. But
I just }{ 02186512031135618 called, so what's the
difference?'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {17186512031135618
'Called? Me? When?'}{86512031135618 }173195519012200168 8
{17186512031135618 I started to point to the telephone and gagged. Right
then, }{02186512031135618 the bottom fell out of things. Exactly five
seconds before the }{15186512031135618 doorbell had sounded I had been
on the phone talking to Cliff in the lab, and the lab was six miles away
from Mary Ann's }{ 0-3186512031135618 house.}{86512031135618
}20600206012200168 8 {15186512031135618 I said, 'I - just spoke to
you.'}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 I wasn't getting across. Cliff
just said, 'To me?' again.}{86512031135618 }178245524012200168 8
{15186512031135618 I was pointing to the phone with both hands now, 'On
the }{16186512031135618 phone. I called the lab. On this phone here!

esty.}{86512031135618 }178340034012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I sat
down, I tried to be very quiet and clear. I said, 'Cliff, }{

phone, I }{03186512031135618 asked you if you had the details worked
out, you said yes, and }{ 02186512031135618 gave them to me. Here they
are. I wrote them down. Is this cor-}{15186512031135618 rect or
not?'}{86512031135618 }173380038012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I handed

tions.}{86512031135618 }168535553012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Cliff
looked at them. He said, 'They're correct. But where }{04186512031135618
could you have gotten them? You didn't work them out
your-}{186512031135618 self, did you?'}{86512031135618
}23500235012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'I just told you. You gave them

{16186512031135618 Cliff shook his head. 'Bill, I haven't been in the
lab since }{ 03186512031135618 seven fifteen. There's nobody
there.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'I spoke
to somebody, I tell you.'}{86512031135618 }173519195012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Mary Ann was fiddling with her gloves. We're getting
late.' }{186512031135618 she said.}{ 86512031135618 }182510105012200168
8 {01186512031135618 I waved my hands at her to wait a bit, and said to
Cliff, 'Look, }{ 0-3186512031135618 are you sure '}{86512031135618
}1785555012200168 8 {17186512031135618 'There's nobody there, unless you
want to count Junior.' }{03186512031135618 Junior was what we called our
pint-sized mechanical brain.}{86512031135618 }16814101014012200168 8
{03186512031135618 We stood there, looking at one another. Mary Ann's
toe was still hitting the floor like a time bomb waiting to
explode.}{86512031135618 }1820550012200168 8 {19186512031135618 Then
Cliff laughed. He said, 'I'm thinking of a cartoon I }{01186512031135618
saw, somewhere. It shows a robot answering the phone and
say-}{15186512031135618 ing, "Honest, boss, there's nobody here but us
complicated }{16186512031135618 thinking machines."'}{ 86512031135618
}18700187012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I didn't think that was funny. I
said, 'Let's go to the lab.'}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Mary Ann said, 'Hey! We won't make the
show.'}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8 {02186512031135618 I said,
'Look, Mary Ann, this is very important. It's just going }{
15186512031135618 to take a minute. Come along with us and we'll go
straight to }{04186512031135618 the show from there.'}{86512031135618
}18210101010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 She said, 'The show starts -'
And then she stopped talking, because I grabbed her wrist and we left!}{
86512031135618 }178105510012200168 8 {16186512031135618 That j ust shows
how excited I was. Ordinarily, I wouldn't ever have dreamed of shoving
her around. I mean, Mary Ann }{15186512031135618 is quite a lady. It's
just that I had so many things on my mind. }{ 03186512031135618 I don't
even really remember grabbing her wrist, come to think
}{15186512031135618 of it. It's just that the next thing I knew, I was
in the auto and }{ 01186512031135618 so was Cliff and so was she, and
she was rubbing her wrist and }{04186512031135618 muttering under her
breath about big gorillas.}{86512031135618

}19200192012200168 8 {17186512031135618 I said, 'Did I hurt you, Mary

'No, of course not. I have my arm yanked out of }{15186512031135618 its
socket every day, just for fun.' Then she kicked me in the
}{0-1186512031135618 shin.}{86512031135618 }{02186512031135618 She only
does things like that because she has red hair. Ac-}{15186512031135618
tually, she has a very gentle nature, but she tries very hard to }{
03186512031135618 live up to the redhead mythology. I see right through
that, of }{04186512031135618 course, but I humor her, poor
kid.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618 We were at
the laboratory in twenty minutes.}{86512031135618 }192000006837027 8
{15186512031135618 The Institute is empty at night. It's emptier than a
building }{16186512031135618 would ordinarily be. You see, it's designed
to have crowds of}{6837027 }{01186512031135618 students rushing through
the corridors and when they aren't }{186512031135618 there, it's
unnaturally lonely. Or maybe it was just that I was }{0-1186512031135618
afraid to see what might be sitting in our laboratory upstairs.
}{186512031135618 Either way, footsteps were uncomfortably loud and the
self-}{0-3186512031135618 service elevator was downright
dingy.}{86512031135618 }182034340012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 I said
to Mary Ann, 'This won't take long.' But she just snif-}{

}18200182012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 She can't help looking
beautiful.}{86512031135618 }178029290012200168 8 {0-3186512031135618
Cliff had the key to the laboratory and I looked over his shoul-}{
0-1186512031135618 der when he opened the door. There was nothing to
see. Junior }{0-4186512031135618 was there, sure, but he looked just as
}{ 0-4186512031135618 he }{0-4186512031135618 had when I saw him last.
}{186512031135618 The dials in front registered nothing and except for
that, there was just a large box, with a cable running back into the
wall }{-1-9186512031135618 socket.}{86512031135618 }178524245012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Cliff and I walked up on either side of Junior. I
think we }{0-2186512031135618 were planning to grab it if it made a
sudden move. But then we }{186512031135618 stopped because Junior just
wasn't doing anything. Mary Ann }{0-2186512031135618 was looking at it,
too. In fact, she ran her middle finger along its top and then looked at
the finger tip and twiddled it against her }{186512031135618 thumb to
get rid of the dust.}{86512031135618 }17814242414012200168 8
{0-1186512031135618 'I said, 'Mary Ann, don't you go near it. Stay at

}{0-2186512031135618 realize that a laboratory wasn't the same thing as
a baby's bed-}{186512031135618 room, if you know what I mean. The
janitor comes in twice a day and all he does is empty the wastebaskets.
About once a week, he comes in with a dirty mop, makes mud on the floor,
}{0-1186512031135618 and shoves i t around a little.}{86512031135618

Junior. }{ 0-2186512031135618 I swallowed and said, 'Maybe you don't
remember right.' I tried }{0-1186512031135618 to laugh without sounding

are you going to do?'}{86512031135618 }{0-1186512031135618 'Just take a
look inside. For laughs.'}{86512031135618 }178385538012200168 8
{0-1186512031135618 Mary Ann said, 'You'll get yourself all dirty.' So I
put on my lab coat. She's a very thoughtful girl, Mary Ann.}
{86512031135618 }226000006837027 8 {0-2186512031135618 I got to work
with a screw driver. Of course, once Junior was}{6837027 }{
15186512031135618 really perfected, we were going to have models
manufactured }{02186512031135618 in welded, one-piece cases. We were
even thinking of molded }{ 15186512031135618 plastic in colors, for home
use. In the lab model, though, we }{04186512031135618 held it together
with screws so that we could take it apart and put it together as often
as we wanted to.}{86512031135618 }18210343410012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Only the screws weren't coming out. I grunted and
yanked }{02186512031135618 and said, 'Some joker was putting his weight
on these when he }{01186512031135618 screwed, these things
in.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Cliff said,
'You're the only one who ever touches the thing.'}{86512031135618
}17814292914012200168 8 {15186512031135618 He was right, too, but that
didn't make it any easier. I stood }{ 16186512031135618 up and passed
the back of my hand over my forehead. I held }{15186512031135618 out the
screw driver to him, 'Want to try?'}{86512031135618
}18210292910012200168 8 {04186512031135618 He did, and didn't get any
further than I did. He said, 'That's funny.'}{86512031135618
}20200202012200168 8 {16186512031135618 I said, 'What's
funny?'}{86512031135618 }16829242429012200168 8 {04186512031135618 He
said, 'I had a screw turning just now. It moved about an eighth of an
inch and then the screw driver slipped.'}{86512031135618
}20200202012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'What's funny about
that?'}{86512031135618 }18719191919012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Cliff
backed away and put down the screw driver with two }{15186512031135618
fingers, 'What's funny is that I saw the screw move back an
}{04186512031135618 eighth of an inch and tighten up
again.'}{86512031135618 }18724141424012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mary
Ann was fidgeting again. She said, 'Why don't your }{01186512031135618
scientific minds think of a blowtorch, if you're so anxious.' There
}{17186512031135618 was a blowtorch on one of the benches and she was
pointing }{02186512031135618 to it.}{ 86512031135618
}17834101034012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Well, ordinarily, I wouldn't
think any more of using a blow-}{ 04186512031135618 torch on Junior than
on myself. But I was thinking something }{16186512031135618 and Cliff
was thinking something and we were both thinking }{ 04186512031135618
the same thing }{04186512031135618 Junior didn't want to be opened
up.}{86512031135618 }21600216012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Cliff said,
'What do you think, Bill?'}{86512031135618 }21100211012200168 8
{04186512031135618 And I said, 'I don't know, Cliff.'}{86512031135618
}16843101043012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Mary Ann said, 'Well, hurry
up, lunkhead, we'll miss the }{186512031135618 show.'}{ 86512031135618
}18738101038012200168 8 {03186512031135618 So I picked up the blowtorch
and adjusted the gauge on the oxygen cylinder. It was going to be like
stabbing a friend.}{86512031135618 }173430043012200168 8
{01186512031135618 But Mary Ann stopped the proceedings by saying,
'Well, how stupid can men be? These screws are loose. You must have been
}{04186512031135618 turning the screw driver the wrong
way.'}{86512031135618 }216055006837027 8 {04186512031135618 Now there
isn't much chance of turning a screw driver the wrong way. Just the
same, I don't like to contradict Mary Ann,}{6837027 }{16186512031135618
so I just said, 'Mary Ann, don't stay too close to Ju nior. Why
}{04186512031135618 don't you wait by the door.'}{86512031135618
}168100010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 But she just said, 'Well,
look!' And there was a screw in her }{ 03186512031135618 hand and an
empty hole in the front of Junior's case. She had }{02186512031135618
removed it by hand.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Cliff said, 'Holy Smoke!'}{86512031135618
}182105510012200168 8 {03186512031135618 They were turning, all dozen
screws. They were doing it by }{15186512031135618 themselves, like
little forms crawling out of their holes, turn-ing round and round, then
dropping out. I scrabbled them up }{03186512031135618 and only one was
left. It hung on for a while, the front panel sagging fr om it, till I
reached out. Then the last screw dropped }{02186512031135618 and the
panel fell gently into my arms. I put it to one side.}{86512031135618
}182145514012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Cliff said, 'It did that on
purpose. It heard us mention the }{ 16186512031135618 blowtorch and gave
up.' His face is usually pink, but it was }{01186512031135618 white
then.}{86512031135618 }168245524012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I was
feeling a little queer myself. I said, 'What's it trying to }{
02186512031135618 hide?'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'I don't know.'}{86512031135618 }15834101034012200168
8 {01186512031135618 We bent before its open insides and for a while we
just looked. }{186512031135618 I could hear Mary Ann's toe begin to tap
the floor again. I looked }{02186512031135618 at my wrist watch and I
had to admit to myself we didn't have }{03186512031135618 much time. In
fact, we didn't have any time left.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{15186512031135618 And then I said, 'It's got a
diaphragm.'}{86512031135618 }{02186512031135618 Cliff said, 'Where?' and
bent closer.}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 I pointed, 'And a loud
speaker.'}{86512031135618 }{16186512031135618 'You didn't put them
in?'}{86512031135618 }16824141424012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Of
course I didn't put them in. I ought to know what I put }{
15186512031135618 in. If I put it in, I'd remember.'}{86512031135618
}20200202012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Then how did it get
in?'}{86512031135618 }24101024012200168 8 {16186512031135618 We were
squatting and arguing. I said, 'It made them itself, }{03186512031135618
I suppose. Maybe it grows them. Look at that.' I pointed again. Inside
the box at two different places, were }{01186512031135618 coils of
something that looked like thin garden hose, except that }{
04186512031135618 they were of metal. They spiraled tightly so that they
lay flat. }{02186512031135618 At the end of each coil, the metal divided
into five or six thin filaments that were in little
sub-spirals.}{86512031135618 }21100211012200168 8 {04186512031135618
'You didn't put those in either?'}{86512031135618 }20600206012200168 8
{15186512031135618 'No, I didn't put those in either.'}{86512031135618
}{04186512031135618 'What are they?'}{86512031135618
}1733419193406837027 8 {03186512031135618 He knew what they were and I
knew what they were. Some- thing had to reach out to get materials for
Junior to make parts}{6837027 }{01186512031135618 for itself; something
had to snake out for the telephone. I picked }{ 02186512031135618 up the
front panel and looked at it again. There were two
circu-}{03186512031135618 lar bits of metal cut out and hinged so that
they could swing forward and leave a hole for something to come
through.}{86512031135618 }17810141410012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I
poked a finger through one and held it up for Cliff to see, }{
15186512031135618 and said, 'I didn't put this in
either.'}{86512031135618 }178510105012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mary
Ann was looking over my shoulder now, and without }{02186512031135618
warning she reached out. I was wiping my fingers with a paper towel to
get off the dust and grease and didn't have time to stop
}{03186512031135618 her. I should have known Mary Ann, though; she's
always so }{ 01186512031135618 anxious to help.}{86512031135618
}1825144190145012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Anyway, she reached in to
to}{0416837027 uch one of the - well, we might }{ 04186512031135618 as
well say it - tentacles. I don't know if she actually
touched}{0416837027 }{02186512031135618 them or not. Later on she
claime}{ 0216837027 d she hadn't. But anyway, what }{02186512031135618
happened then was that she let out a little yell and suddenly
sat}{0216837027 }{ 03186512031135618 down and began rubbing her
arm.}{186512031135618 }{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'The same one,' she whimpered. 'First you, and then
}{04186512031135618 that.'}{ 86512031135618 }18710141410012200168 8
{02186512031135618 I helped her up. 'It must have been a loose
connection, Mary }{ 16186512031135618 Ann. I'm sorry, but I told you
-'}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Cliff said,
'Nuts! That was no loose connection. Junior's just }{ 02186512031135618
protecting himself.'}{86512031135618 }192014140012200168 8
{03186512031135618 I had thought the same thing, myself. I had thought
lots of }{15186512031135618 things. Junior was a new kind of machine.
Even the mathe-}{03186512031135618 matics that controlled it were
different from anything anybody }{02186512031135618 had worked with
before. Maybe it had something no machine }{01186512031135618 previously
had ever had. Maybe it felt a desire to stay alive and }{186512031135618
grow. Maybe it would have a desire to make more machines until
}{04186512031135618 there were millions of them all over the earth,
fighting with }{03186512031135618 human beings for
control.}{86512031135618 }18710191910012200168 8 {03186512031135618 I
opened my mouth and Cliff must have known what I was going to say,
because he yelled, 'No. No, don't say it!'} {86512031135618
}18210101010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 But I couldn't stop myself.
It just came out and I said, 'Well, }{ 15186512031135618 look, let's
disconnect Junior - What's the matter?'}{86512031135618
}187140014012200168 8 {186512031135618 Cliff said bitterly, 'Because
he's listening to what we say, you }{15186512031135618 jackass. He heard
about the blowtorch, didn't he? I was going to sneak up behind it, but
now it will probably electrocute me }{16186512031135618 if I
try.'}{86512031135618 }182195519012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Mary Ann
was still brushing at the back of her dress and say-}{ 02186512031135618
ing how dirty the floor was, even though I kept telling her I had
}{04186512031135618 nothing to do with that. I mean, it's the janitor
that makes the }{ 02186512031135618 mud.}{86512031135618
}18724676724012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 Anyway, she
said}{0-2186512031135618 , }{ 0-2186512031135618 'Why don't you put on
rubber gloves and yank the cord out?"}{86512031135618
}18238626238012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I could see Cliff was trying
to think of reasons why that }{ 0-1186512031135618 wouldn't work. He
didn't think of any, so he put on the rubber }{0-3186512031135618 gloves
and walked towards Junior.}{86512031135618 }22600226012200168 8
{0-2186512031135618 I yelled, 'Watch out!'}{86512031135618
}19729626229012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 It was a stupid thing to
say. He }{0-1186512031135618 had }{ 0-1186512031135618 to watch out; he
had no }{02186512031135618 choice. One of the tentacles moved and there
was no doubt }{01186512031135618 what they were now. It whirled out and
drew a line between }{186512031135618 Cliff and the power cable. It
remained there, vibrating a little }{0-3186512031135618 with its six
finger-tendrils splayed out. Tubes inside Junior were
}{0-2186512031135618 beginning to glow. Cliff didn't try to go past that
tentacle. He backed way and after a while, it spiraled inward again. He
took }{ 0-4186512031135618 off his rubber gloves.}{86512031135618
}182140014012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Bill,' he said, 'we're not
going to get anywhere. That's a }{ 0-1186512031135618 smarter gadget
than we dreamed we could make. It was smart enough to use my voice as a
model when it built its diaphragm. }{186512031135618 It may become smart
enough to learn how to-' He looked over }{0-3186512031135618 his
shoulder, and whispered, 'how to generate its own power and

}18210676710012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 Cliff snook his head, 'We
can't have anyone else find out. }{ 03186512031135618 They'll build

}19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Then what do we

}187567675012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I felt a sharp blow on my
chest. I looked down and it was }{0-1186512031135618 Mary Ann, getting
ready to spit fire. She said, 'Look, lunkhead, }{0-3186512031135618 if
we've got a date, we've got one, and if we haven't, we haven't.

}18714101014012200168 8 {03186512031135618 She wasn't listening; she was
talking. I wish I could remem-}{ 16186512031135618 ber what she said
after that. Or maybe I don't; maybe it's just }{01186512031135618 as
well I can't remember, since none of it was very compliment-}{
03186512031135618 ary. Every once in a while I would manage a 'But, Mary

swallowed up.}{ 86512031135618 }178105510012200168 8 {03186512031135618
Actually, as I said, she's a very gentle creature and it's only when she
gets excited that she's ever talkative or unreasonable.
}{01186512031135618 Of course, with red hair, she feels she ought to get
excited rather }{ 04186512031135618 often. That's my theory, anyway. She
just feels she has to live }{15186512031135618 up to her red
hair.}{86512031135618 }182100010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Anyway,

clearly is Mary Ann }{16186512031135618 finishing with a stamp on my
right foot and then turning to }{02186512031135618 leave. I ran after
her, trying once again, 'But, Mary Ann -'}{86512031135618
}178105510012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Then Cliff yelled at us.
Generally, he doesn't pay any atten-}{ 16186512031135618 tion to us, but
this time he was shouting. 'Why don't you ask }{04186512031135618 her to
marry you, you lunkhead?'}{86512031135618 }18210101010012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Mary Ann stopped. She was in the doorway by then but
she }{15186512031135618 didn't turn around. I stopped too, and felt the
words get thick and clogged up in my throat. I couldn't even manage a
'But, }{18186512031135618 Mary Ann -'}{86512031135618
}18210141410012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Cliff was yelling in the
background. I heard him as though he were a mile away. He was shouting,
'I got it! I got it!' over and }{186512031135618 over
again.}{86512031135618 }187514145012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Then
Mary Ann turned and she looked so beautiful - Did I }{02186512031135618
tell you that she's got green eyes with a touch of blue in them? Anyway
she looked so beautiful that all the words in my throat jammed together
very tightly and came out in that funny sound }{01186512031135618 you
make when you swallow.}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8
{02186512031135618 She said, 'Were you going to say something,
Bill?'}{86512031135618 }16814141414012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Well,
Cliff had put it in my head. My voice was hoarse and }{
04186512031135618 I said, 'Will you marry me, Mary Ann?'}{86512031135618
}1870550012200168 8 {18186512031135618 The minute I said it, I wished I
hadn't, because I thought }{03186512031135618 she would never speak to
me again. Then two minutes after that I was glad I had, because she
threw her arms around me and }{04186512031135618 reached up to kiss me.
It was a while before I was quite clear }{ 01186512031135618 what was
happening, and then I began to kiss back. This went on
}{15186512031135618 for quite a long time, until Cliff's banging on my
shoulder }{ 03186512031135618 managed to attract my
attention.}{86512031135618 }17814141414012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I
turned and said, snappishly, 'What the devil do you want?' }{
03186512031135618 It was a little ungrateful. After all, he had started
this.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {210186512031135618 He
said,'Look!'}{86512031135618 }18210141410012200168 8 {04186512031135618
In his hand, he held the main lead that had connected Junior }{
02186512031135618 to the power supply.}{86512031135618
}16814141414012200168 8 {15186512031135618 I had forgotten about Junior,
but now it came back. I said, }{ 03186512031135618 'He's disconnected,
then.'}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {18186512031135618
'Cold!'}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 'How did you do
it?'}{86512031135618 }182014140012200168 8 {16186512031135618 He said,
'Junior was so busy watching you and Mary Ann }{15186512031135618 fight
that I managed to sneak up on it. Mary Ann put on one }{186512031135618
good show.'}{86512031135618 }182519195012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I
didn't like that remark because Mary Ann is a very dignified }{
02186512031135618 and self-contained sort of girl and doesn't put on
'shows'. How-}{03186512031135618 ever, I had too much in hand to take
issue with him.}{ 86512031135618 }18210141410012200168 8
{04186512031135618 I said to Mary Ann, 'I don't have much to offer, Mary
Ann; }{ 01186512031135618 just a school teacher's salary. Now that we've
dismantled Junior, }{04186512031135618 there isn't even any chance of
-'}{86512031135618 }17314191914012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Mary Ann
said, 'I don't care, Bill. I just gave up on you, you }{
03186512031135618 lunkhead darling. I've tried practically everything
-'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'You've been
kicking my shins and stamping on my toes.'}{86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'I'd run out of everything else.
I was desperate.'}{86512031135618 }16814141414012200168 8
{04186512031135618 The logic wasn't quite clear, but I didn't answer
because I remembered about the show. I looked at my watch and said,
}{01186512031135618 'Look, Mary Ann, if we hurry we can still make the
second act.'}{ 86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {03186512031135618
She said, 'Who wants to see the show?'}{86512031135618
}17829191929012200168 8 {03186512031135618 So I kissed her some more;
and we never did get to see the }{ 0-2186512031135618 show at
all.}{86512031135618 }18229101029012200168 8 {02186512031135618 There's
only one thing that bothers me now. Mary Ann and I }{ 16186512031135618
are married, and we're perfectly happy. I just had a
promo-}{02186512031135618 tion; I'm an associate professor now. Cliff
keeps working away at plans for building a controllable Junior and he's
making pro-}{0-4186512031135618 gress.}{86512031135618
}21100211012200168 8 {02186512031135618 None of that's
it.}{86512031135618 }17834101034012200168 8 {02186512031135618 You see,
I talked to Cliff the next evening, to tell him Mary Ann and I were
going to marry and to thank him for giving me }{186512031135618 the
idea. And after staring at me for a minute, he swore he hadn't
}{03186512031135618 said it; he hadn't shouted for me to propose
marriage.}{86512031135618 }187295529012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Of
course, there was something else in the room with Cliff's }{
0-4186512031135618 voice.}{86512031135618 }211000004677271 8
{16186512031135618 I keep worrying Mary Ann will find out. She's the
gentlest}{4677271 }{ 16186512031135618 girl I know, but she
}{16186512031135618 has }{16186512031135618 got red hair. She can't help
trying to }{ 04186512031135618 live up to that, or have I said that
already?}{86512031135618 }{15186512031135618 Anyway, what will she say
if she ever finds out that I didn't }{03186512031135618 have the sense
to propose till a }{ 03186512031135618 machine }{03186512031135618 told
me to?}{0318651203 }{46772711135618 }10191910012200168 8
{02186512031135618 We all have our lovable eccentricities and I have a
few that are }{ 01186512031135618 all my own.}{86512031135618
}182010100012200168 8 {01186512031135618 For instance, I hate nice days.
Show me a day in which the }{186512031135618 temperature is just 78, and
a light breeze has the lush foliage of }{15186512031135618 June, or the
just turning leaves of September, rustling with a }{17186512031135618
soft murmur; a day in which there is a drowsy softness over
}{0-2186512031135618 the landscape, and a sweet freshness to the air,
and a general }{16186512031135618 pea cefulness over the world, and I'll
show you one unhappy }{03186512031135618 fellow }{03186512031135618 -
}{03186512031135618 namely, me.}{ 86512031135618 }197010100012200168 8
{04186512031135618 There's a reason for it, a good one. (You don't think
I'm }{186512031135618 irrational, do you?) As I said in the preface-to
'Sally', I am a }{04186512031135618 compulsive writer. That means that
my idea of a pleasant time }{15186512031135618 is to go up to my attic,
sit at my electric typewriter (as I am }{16186512031135618 doing right
now), and bang away, watching the words take }{15186512031135618 shape
like magic before my eyes. To minimize distractions, I
}{16186512031135618 keep the window-shades down at all times and work
exclu-}{186512031135618 sively by artificial light.}{ 86512031135618
}173510105012200168 8 {186512031135618 No one has any particular
objection to this as long as we have }{02186512031135618 the sleet of a
typical New England late fall day darting through the air, or the
blustering wind of a typical New England early }{01186512031135618
spring day, or the leaden weight of Gulf air that splats out over New
England in the summer, or the dancing flakes of that third
}{15186512031135618 foot of snow that blankets New England in the
winter. Every-}{03186512031135618 one says, 'Boy, you're lucky you don't
have to go out in that }{0-2186512031135618 weather.'}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {15186512031135618 And I agree with
them.}{86512031135618 }163190019012200168 8 {03186512031135618 But then
comes a beautiful day in May-June or September-October and everyone says
to me, 'What are you doing indoors }{04186512031135618 on a day like
this, you creep?' Sometimes out of sheer indig-}{ 01186512031135618
nation they pick me up and throw me out of the window so I can enjoy the
nice day.}{86512031135618 }187340034012200168 8 {17186512031135618 The
niceness of being a writer, of course, is that you take }{
02186512031135618 all your frustrations and annoyances and spread them
out on }{01186512031135618 paper. This prevents them from building up to
dangerous levels }{ 02186512031135618 and explains why writers in
general are such lovable, normal people and are a joy to all who know
them.}{86512031135618 }182290029012200168 8 {02186512031135618 For
instance, I wrote a novel in 1953 which pictured a world in which
everyone lived in underground cities, comfortably en-}{01186512031135618
closed away from the open air.}{86512031135618 }182240024012200168 8
{01186512031135618 People would say, 'How could you imagine such a
night-}{ -1-7186512031135618 marish situation?}{-1-7186512031135618
1}{86512031135618 }182558585012200168 8 {04186512031135618 And I would
answer in astonishment, 'What nightmarish }{0-1186512031135618
situation?'}{86512031135618 }17310585810012200168 8 {15186512031135618
But with me everything becomes a challenge. Having made }{
16186512031135618 my pitch in favor of enclosure, I wondered if I could
reverse }{02186512031135618 the situation.}{86512031135618
}18210484810012200168 8 {04186512031135618 So I wrote 'It's Such a
Beautiful Day' - and did such a good }{ 17186512031135618 job at
convincing myself, that very often these days, some-}{15186512031135618
times twice in one week, when I feel I've put in a good day's }{
01186512031135618 work, I go out in the late afternoon and take a walk
through the neighborhood.}{86512031135618 }17329484829012200168 8

2117, the field-modulator brake-valve in the Door belonging to Mrs.
Richard Hanshaw depolarized for reasons un-}{03186512031135618 known. As
a result, Mrs. Hanshaw's day was completely upset }{ 02186512031135618
and her son, Richard, Jr., first developed his strange
neurosis.}{86512031135618 }19248141448012200168 8 {01186512031135618 It
was not the type of thing you would find listed as a neurosis }{
03186512031135618 in the usual textbooks and certainly young Richard
behaved, in }{01186512031135618 most respects, just as a well-brought-up
twelve-year-old in pros-}{ 03186512031135618 perous circumstances ought
to behave.}{86512031135618 }178585558012200168 8 {03186512031135618 And
yet from April 12 on, Richard Hanshaw, Jr., could only with regret ever
persuade himself to go through a Door. }{86512031135618
}18762006209255599 8 {04186512031135618 Of all this, on April 12, Mrs.
Hanshaw had no premonition. }{15186512031135618 She woke in the morning
(an ordinary morning) as her mek-}{03186512031135618 kano slithered
gently into her room, with a cup of coffee on a small tray. Mrs. Hanshaw
was planning a visit to New York in }{ 16186512031135618 the afternoon
and she had several things to do first that could}{9255599
}{03186512031135618 not quite be trusted to a mekkano, so after one or
two sips, she }{ 02186512031135618 stepped out of bed.}{86512031135618
}187048480012200168 8 {02186512031135618 The mekkano backed away, moving
silently along the dia-magnetic field that kept its oblong body half an
inch above the }{01186512031135618 floor, and moved back to the kitchen,
where its simple computer }{ 04186512031135618 was quite adequate to set
the proper controls on the various kitchen appliances in order that an
appropriate breakfast might }{02186512031135618 be prepared.}{
86512031135618 }17310434310012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw,
having bestowed the usual sentimental glance }{ 04186512031135618 upon
the cubograph of her dead husband, passed through the
}{15186512031135618 stages of her morning ritual with a certain
contentment. She }{ 16186512031135618 could hear her son across the hall
clattering through his, but }{15186512031135618 she knew she need not
interfere with him. The mekkano was }{ 03186512031135618 well adjusted
to see to it, as a matter of course, that he was }{17186512031135618
showered, that he had on a change of clothing, and that he }{
01186512031135618 would eat a nourishing breakfast. The tergo-shower she
had had }{15186512031135618 installed the year before made the morning
wash and dry so quick and pleasant that, really, she felt certain Dickie
would }{02186512031135618 wash even without supervision.}{86512031135618
}17319242419012200168 8 {16186512031135618 On a morning like this, when
she was busy, it would cer-}{02186512031135618 tainly not be necessary
for her to do more than deposit a casual }{01186512031135618 peck on the
boy's cheek before he left. She heard the soft chime }{03186512031135618
the mekkano sounded to indicate approaching school time and
}{02186512031135618 she floated, down the force-lift to the lower floor
(her hair-style for the day only sketchily designed, as yet) in order to
perform }{ 03186512031135618 that motherly duty.}{86512031135618
}18229292929012200168 8 {15186512031135618 She found Richard standing at
the door, with his text-reels }{ 02186512031135618 and pocket projector
dangling by their strap and a frown on his }{-1-6186512031135618
face.}{86512031135618 }17338292938012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Say,

}17848191948012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She said, almost
automatically, 'Nonsense, Dickie. I never }{ 03186512031135618 heard of
such a thing.'}{86512031135618 }22600226012200168 8 {02186512031135618
'Well, you try.'}{86512031135618 }16358101058012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw tried a number of times. Strange, the
school }{02186512031135618 door was always set for general reception.
She tried other co-ordinates. Her friends' Doors might not be set for
reception, but }{01186512031135618 there would be a signal at least, and
then she could explain.}{ 86512031135618 }244000009255599 8
{03186512031135618 But nothing happened at all. The Door remained an
inactive }{15186512031135618 gray barrier despite all her manipulations.
It was obvious that}{9255599 }{186512031135618 the Door was out of order
- and only five months after its an-}{0-1186512031135618 nual fall
inspection by the company.}{86512031135618 }{0-1186512031135618 She was
quite angry about it.}{86512031135618 }182010100012200168 8
{02186512031135618 It }{02186512031135618 would }{ 02186512031135618
happen on a day when she had so much planned. }{0-1186512031135618 She
thought petulantly of the fact that a month earlier she had
}{186512031135618 decided against installing a subsidiary Door on the
ground that }{0-3186512031135618 it was an unnecessary expense. How was
she to know that Doors }{0-1186512031135618 were getting to be so
}{0-1186512031135618 shoddy?}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8
{186512031135618 She stepped to the visiphone while the anger still
burned in }{01186512031135618 her and said to Richard, "You just go down
the road, Dickie, }{186512031135618 and use the Williamsons'
Door.'}{86512031135618 }1870000012200168 8 {01186512031135618
Ironically, in view of later developments, Richard balked.
}{186512031135618 'Aw, gee, Mom, I'll get dirty. Can't I stay home till
the Door is fixed?'}{86512031135618 }1820550012200168 8
{0-2186512031135618 And, as ironically, Mrs. Hanshaw insisted. With her
finger on }{186512031135618 the combination board of the phone, she
said, 'You won't get }{0-1186512031135618 dirty if you put flexies on
your shoes, and don't forget to brush yourself well before you go into
their house.'}{ 86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618

{0-2186512031135618 'No back-talk, Dickie. You've got to be in school.

late.'}{86512031135618 }16814141414012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 The
mekkano, an advanced model and very responsive, was already standing
before Richard with flexies in one appendage.}{86512031135618
}182105510012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 Richard pulled the transparent
plastic shields over his shoes and moved down the hall with visible
reluctance. 'I don't even }{186512031135618 know how to work this thing,
Mom.'}{86512031135618 }178514145012200168 8 {01186512031135618 'You just
push that button,' Mrs. Hanshaw called. 'The red }{0-2186512031135618

no,' he called back, morosely, 'what do you think I }{
0-2186512031135618 am? A baby? Gosh!' His muttering was cut off by a
slam.}{86512031135618 }{0-1186512031135618 With flying fingers, Mrs.
Hanshaw punched the appropriate }{0-2186512031135618 combination on the
phone board and thought of the things she }{ 0-1186512031135618 intended
saying to the Company about this.}{86512031135618 }178510105012200168 8
{0-2186512031135618 Joe Bloom, a reasonable young man, who had gone
through }{0-3186512031135618 technology school with added training in
force-field mechanics, }{0-2186512031135618 was at the Hanshaw residence
in less than half an hour. He was }{02186512031135618 really quite
competent, though Mrs. Hanshaw regarded his }{0-1186512031135618 youth
with deep suspicion.}{86512031135618 }1821014141009255599 8
{0-1186512031135618 She opened the movable house-panel when he first
signaled }{186512031135618 and her sight of him was as he stood there,
brushing at himself}{9255599 }{02186512031135618 vigorously to remove
the dust of the open air. He took off his }{01186512031135618 flexies
and dropped them where he stood. Mrs. Hanshaw closed }{03186512031135618
the house-panel against the flash of raw sunlight that had
en-}{15186512031135618 tered. She found herself irrationally hoping that
the step-by-}{04186512031135618 step trip from the public Door had been
an unpleasant one. Or }{01186512031135618 perhaps that the public Door
itself had been out of order and the }{04186512031135618 youth had had
to lug his tools even farther than the necessary }{02186512031135618 two
hundred yards. She wanted the Company, or its
representa-}{04186512031135618 tive at least, to suffer a bit. It would
teach them what broken }{01186512031135618 Doors meant.}{ 86512031135618
}16814292914012200168 8 {04186512031135618 But he seemed cheerful and
unperturbed as he said, 'Good }{03186512031135618 morning, ma'am. I came
to see about your Door.'}{86512031135618 }17314343414012200168 8
{16186512031135618 'I'm glad someone did,' said Mrs. Hanshaw,
ungraciously. }{04186512031135618 'My day is quite
ruined.'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Sorry,

}17810242410012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'It just won't work. Nothing
at all happens when you adjust }{ 16186512031135618 co-ords,' said Mrs.
Hanshaw. 'There was no warning at all. I had to send my son out to the
neighbors through that - that }{02186512031135618 thing.'}{

the entrance through which the repair man }{186512031135618 had come.}{
86512031135618 }17319191919012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He smiled and
spoke out of the conscious wisdom of his own }{ 03186512031135618
specialized training in Doors. 'That's a door, too, ma'am. You don't
give that kind a capital letter when you write it. It's a hand-door,
sort of. It used to be the only kind once.'}{ 86512031135618
}17824242424012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Well, at least it works. My

germs.'}{86512031135618 }17329141429012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'It's
not bad outside today, ma'am,' he said, with the con-}{
04186512031135618 noisseur-like air of one whose profession forced him
into the }{03186512031135618 open nearly every day. 'Sometimes it }{
03186512031135618 is }{03186512031135618 real unpleasant. But I
}{15186512031135618 guess you want I should fix this here Door, ma'am,
so I'll get }{ 02186512031135618 on with it.'}{86512031135618
}17338101038012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He sat down on the floor,
opened the large tool case he had brought in with him and in half a
minute, by use of a point-demagnetizer, he had the control panel removed
and a set of in-}{186512031135618 tricate vitals exposed.}{
86512031135618 }18243101043012200168 8 {01186512031135618 He whistled to
himself as he placed the fine electrodes of the field-analyzer on
numerous points, studying the shifting needles }{03186512031135618 on
the dials. Mrs. Hanshaw watched him, arms folded.}{ 86512031135618
}178480048012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Finally, he said, 'Well, here's
something,' and with a deft }{02186512031135618 twist, he disengaged the
brake-valve.}{86512031135618 }187067670012200168 8 {17186512031135618 He
tapped it with a fingernail and said, 'This here
brake-}{15186512031135618 valve is depolarized, ma'am. There's your
whole trouble.' He }{04186512031135618 ran his finger along the little
pigeonholes in his tool case and }{02186512031135618 liften out a
duplicate of the object he had taken from the door }{16186512031135618
mechanism. 'These things just go all of a sudden. Can't
pre-}{04186512031135618 dict it.'}{ 86512031135618 }18219626219012200168
8 {03186512031135618 He put the control panel back and stood up. 'It'll
work now, }{ 04186512031135618 ma'am.'}{86512031135618
}182195343585319012200168 8 {19186512031135618 He punched a reference
combination, blanked it, then}{1919255599 }{ 17186512031135618 punched
another. Each time, the dull gray of the Door gave}{1719255599
}{01186512031135618 way to a deep, velvety blackness. He said, 'Will you
sign here,}{0119255599 }{03186512031135618 ma'am? and put down your
charge number, too, please? Thank}{0319255599 }{ 02186512031135618 you,
ma'am.'}{86512031135618 }17834434334012200168 8 {17186512031135618 He
punched a new combination, that of his home factory, }{01186512031135618
and with a polite touch of finger to forehead, he stepped through
}{02186512031135618 the Door. As his body entered the blackness, it cut
off sharply. }{01186512031135618 Less and less of him was visible and
the tip of his tool case was the last thing that showed. A second after
he had passed through }{03186512031135618 completely, the Door turned
back to dull gray.}{ 86512031135618 }18234383834012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Half an hour later, when Mrs. Hanshaw had finally
completed }{ 04186512031135618 her interrupted preparations and was
fuming over the misfor-}{02186512031135618 tune of the morning, the
phone buzzed annoyingly and her real troubles began.}{ 86512031135618
}17353343453012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Miss Elizabeth Robbins was
distressed. Little Dick Hanshaw }{ 01186512031135618 had always been a
good pupil. She hated to report him like this. }{02186512031135618 And
yet, she told herself, his actions were certainly queer. And }{
03186512031135618 she would talk to his mother, not to the
principal.}{86512031135618 }18758141458012200168 8 {18186512031135618
She slipped out to the phone during the morning study
}{15186512031135618 period, leaving a student in charge. She made her
connection }{03186512031135618 and found herself staring at Mrs.
Hanshaw's handsome and }{02186512031135618 somewhat formidable head.}{
86512031135618 }17367101067012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Miss Robbins
quailed, but it was too late to turn back. She }{ 02186512031135618
said, diffidently, 'Mrs. Hanshaw, I'm Miss Robbins.' She ended
}{03186512031135618 on a rising note.}{86512031135618
}17377101077012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw looked blank,
then said, 'Richard's teacher?' }{ 04186512031135618 That, too, ended on
a rising note.}{86512031135618 }178820082012200168 8 {15186512031135618
'That's right. I called you, Mrs. Hanshaw,' Miss Robbins
}{16186512031135618 plunged right into it, 'to tell you that Dick was
quite late to }{03186512031135618 school this morning.'}{86512031135618
}26400264012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'He was? But that couldn't be. I
saw him leave.'}{86512031135618 }17810100101012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Miss }{15186512031135618 Robbins looked astonished.
She said, 'You mean you }{04186512031135618 saw him use the
Door?'}{86512031135618 }17886141486012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mrs.
Hanshaw said quickly, 'Well, no. Our Door was tem- porarily out of
order. I sent him to a neighbor and he used that }{02186512031135618
Door.'}{86512031135618 }26400264012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Are you
sure?'}{86512031135618 }26900269012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Of
course I'm sure. I wouldn't lie to you.'}{86512031135618
}17886141486012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'No, no, Mrs. Hanshaw. I
wasn't implying that at all. I meant are yo u sure he found the way to
the neighbor? He might have }{01186512031135618 got
lost.'}{86512031135618 }18282191982012200168 8 {03186512031135618
'Ridiculous. We have the proper maps, and I'm sure Richard }{
04186512031135618 knows the location of every house in District A-3.'
Then, with the quiet pride of one who knows what is her due, she added,
}{03186512031135618 'Not th at he ever needs to know, of course. The
co-ords are all that are necessary at any time.'}{86512031135618
}17877242477012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Miss Robbins, who came from a
family that had always had }{01186512031135618 to economize rigidly on
the use of its Doors (the price of power }{03186512031135618 being what
it was) and who had therefore run errands on foot }{02186512031135618
until quite an advanced age, resented the pride. She said, quite
}{03186512031135618 clearly, 'Well, I'm afraid, Mrs. Hanshaw, that Dick
did not use }{16186512031135618 the neighbor's Door. He was over an hour
late to school and }{186512031135618 the condition of his flexies made
it quite obvious that he tramped }{04186512031135618 cross-country. They
were }{ 04186512031135618 muddy.'}{86512031135618 }17877383877012200168
8 {03186512031135618 'Muddy?' }{03186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw repeated
the emphasis on the word. 'What did he say? What was his
excuse?'}{86512031135618 }17377292977012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Miss
Robbins couldn't help but feel a little glad at the dis-}{
02186512031135618 comfiture of the other woman. She said, 'He wouldn't
talk about }{01186512031135618 it. Frankly, Mrs. Hanshaw, he seems ill.
That's why I called you. }{ 03186512031135618 Perhaps you might want to
have a doctor look at him.'}{86512031135618 }25000250012200168 8
{02186512031135618 'Is he running a temperature?' The mother's voice
went shrill.}{86512031135618 }16886343486012200168 8 {04186512031135618
'Oh, no. I don't mean physically ill. It's just his attitude and }{
01186512031135618 the look in his eyes.' She hesitated, then said with
every attempt at delicacy, 'I thought perhaps a routine checkup with a
psychic }{03186512031135618 probe -'}{ 86512031135618
}17896383896012200168 8 {03186512031135618 She didn't finish. Mrs.
Hanshaw, in a chilled voice and with }{ 01186512031135618 what was as
close to a snort as her breeding would permit, said, }{02186512031135618
'Are you implying that Richard is }{ 02186512031135618
neurotic}{02186512031135618 ?'}{86512031135618 }27800278012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'Oh, no, Mrs. Hanshaw, but -'}{86512031135618
}27804343009255599 8 {03186512031135618 'It certainly sounded so. The
idea! He has always been per-}{17186512031135618 fectly healthy. I'll
take this up with him when he gets home.}{9255599 }{03186512031135618
I'm sure there's a perfectly normal explanation which he'll give }{
420186512031135618 me'}{86512031135618 }192190019012200168 8
{15186512031135618 The connection broke abruptly, and Miss Robbins felt
hurt and uncommonly foolish. After all she had only tried to help,
}{02186512031135618 t o fulfill what she considered an obligation to her
students. - She hurried back to the classroom with a glance at the metal
face of the wall clock. The study period was drawing to an end. English
Composition next.}{86512031135618 }182240024012200168 8
{02186512031135618 But her mind wasn't completely on English
Composition. Automatically, she called the students to have them read
selec-}{01186512031135618 tions from their literary creations. And
occasionally she punched }{04186512031135618 one of those selections on
tape and ran it through the small }{02186512031135618 vocalizer to show
the students how English }{02186512031135618 should }{ 02186512031135618
be read.}{86512031135618 }187145514012200168 8 {01186512031135618 The
vocalizer's mechanical voice, as always, dripped
perfec-}{186512031135618 tion, but, again as always, lacked character.
Sometimes, she won-}{02186512031135618 dered if it was wise to try to
train the students into a speech that }{04186512031135618 was divorced
from individuality and geared only to a mass-}{02186512031135618 average
accent and intonation.}{86512031135618 }18710101010012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Today, however, she had no thought for that. It was
Richard }{ 16186512031135618 Hanshaw she watched. He sat quietly in his
seat, quite ob-}{15186512031135618 viously indifferent to his
surroundings. He was lost deep in }{ 04186512031135618 himself and just
not the same boy he had been. It was obvious to her that he had had some
unusual experience that morning and, really, she was right to call his
mother, although perhaps }{ 17186512031135618 she ought not to have made
the remark about the probe. Still }{02186512031135618 it was quite the
thing these days. All sorts of people got probed. }{ 03186512031135618
There wasn't any disgrace attached to it. Or there shouldn't be,
}{0-3186512031135618 anyway.}{86512031135618 }192534345012200168 8
{04186512031135618 She called on Richard, finally. She had to call
twice, before }{ 03186512031135618 he responded and rose to his
feet.}{86512031135618 }187029290012200168 8 {17186512031135618 The
general subject assigned had been: 'If you had your }{01186512031135618
choice of traveling on some ancient vehicle, which would you
}{02186512031135618 choose, and why?' Miss Robbins tried to use the
topic every }{01186512031135618 semester. It was a good one because it
carried a sense of history }{15186512031135618 with it. It forced the

people in past ages.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8
{01186512031135618 She listened while Richard Hanshaw read in a low
voice.}{86512031135618 }18252929509255599 8 {02186512031135618 'If I had
my choice of ancient vehicles,' he said, pronouncing }{
16186512031135618 the 'h' in vehicles, 'I would choose the stratoliner.
It travels }{01186512031135618 slow like all vehicles but it is clean.
Because it travels in the }{ 15186512031135618 stratosphere, it must be
all enclosed so that you are not likely}{9255599 }{03186512031135618 to
catch disease. You can see the stars if it is night time almost
}{02186512031135618 as good as in a planetarium. If you look down you
can see the }{03186512031135618 Earth like a map or maybe see clouds -'
He went on for several hundred more words.}{86512031135618
}192024240012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She said brightly when he had
finished reading, 'It's pro-}{02186512031135618 nounced vee-ick-ulls,
Richard. No "h". Accent on the first syl-lable. And you don't say
"travels slow" or "see good". What do you say, class?'}{86512031135618
}173524245012200168 8 {17186512031135618 There was a small chorus of
responses and she went on, }{04186512031135618 That's right. Now what is
the difference between an adjective }{15186512031135618 and an adverb?
Who can tell me?'}{86512031135618 }16810191910012200168 8
{16186512031135618 And so it went. Lunch passed. Some pupils stayed to
eat; }{03186512031135618 some went home. Richard stayed. Miss Robbins
noted that, as usually he didn't.}{86512031135618 }17319191919012200168
8 {04186512031135618 The afternoon passed, too, and then there was the
final bell }{ 02186512031135618 and the usual upsurging hum as
twenty-five boys and girls rat-}{03186512031135618 tled their belongings
together and took their leisurely place in }{ -1-5186512031135618
line.}{86512031135618 }15834242434012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Miss
Robbins clapped her hands together. 'Quickly, children. }{
01186512031135618 Come, Zelda, take your place.'}{86512031135618
}17329141429012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'I dropped my tape-punch,
Miss Robbins,' shrilled the girl, }{ 0-4186512031135618
defensively.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618
'Well, pick it up, pick it up. Now children, be brisk, be
brisk.'}{86512031135618 }17329191929012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She
pushed the button that slid a section of the wall into a recess and
revealed the gray blankness of a large Door. It was }{15186512031135618
not the usual Door that the occasional student used in going home for
lunch, but an advanced model that was one of the }{02186512031135618
prides of this well-to-do private school.}{86512031135618
}16838141438012200168 8 {03186512031135618 In addition to its double
width, it possessed a large and im-}{186512031135618 pressively
gear-filled 'automatic serial finder' which was capable
}{01186512031135618 of adjusting the door for a number of different
co-ordinates at }{186512031135618 automatic intervals.}{ 86512031135618
}16843101043012200168 8 {186512031135618 At the beginning of the
semester, Miss Robbins always had to }{02186512031135618 spend an
afternoon with the mechanic, adjusting the device for
}{01186512031135618 the co-ordinates of the home of the new class. But
then, thank }{15186512031135618 goodness, it rarely needed attention for
the remainder of the }{0-2186512031135618 term.}{86512031135618
}173580058012200168 8 {03186512031135618 The class lined up
alphabetically, first girls, then boys. The }{ 15186512031135618 Door
went velvety black and Hester Adams waved her hand }{03186512031135618
and stepped through. 'By-y-y -'}{86512031135618 }24000240012200168 8
{186512031135618 The 'bye' was cut off in the middle, as it almost
always was.}{86512031135618 }1825005012200168 8 {15186512031135618 The
Door went gray, then black again, and Theresa Cant-}{186512031135618
rocchi went through. Gray, black, Zelda Charlowicz. Gray, black,
}{03186512031135618 Patricia Coombs. Gray, black, Sara May
Evans.}{86512031135618 }1870000012200168 8 {01186512031135618 The line
grew smaller as the door swallowed them one by one, }{02186512031135618
depositing each in her home. Of course, an occasional mother forgot to
leave the house Door on special reception at the ap-}{03186512031135618
propriate time and then the school Door remained gray. Auto-}{
16186512031135618 matically, after a minute-long wait, the Door went on
to the }{04186512031135618 next combination in line and the pupil in
question had to wait }{ 16186512031135618 till it was all over, after
which a phone call to the forgetful }{01186512031135618 parent would set
things right. This was always bad for the pupils involved, especially
the sensitive ones who took seriously the }{02186512031135618
implication that they were little thought of at home. Miss Rob-}{
03186512031135618 bins always tried to impress this on visiting parents,
but it hap-}{02186512031135618 pened at least once every semester just
the same.}{ 86512031135618 }17314101014012200168 8 {03186512031135618

}187010100012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Of course, another trouble, and
a more frequent one was the }{15186512031135618 boy or girl who got into
line out of place. They }{15186512031135618 would }{15186512031135618 do
it }{03186512031135618 despite the teacher's sharpest watch,
particularly at the begin-}{16186512031135618 ning of the term when the
proper order was less familiar to }{01186512031135618 them.}{
86512031135618 }178514145012200168 8 {16186512031135618 When that
happened, children would be popping into the }{01186512031135618 wrong
houses by the half-dozen and would have to be sent back.
}{17186512031135618 It always meant a mixup that took minutes to
straighten out }{03186512031135618 and parents were invariably
irate.}{86512031135618 }17314191914012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Miss

to the boy at the head of the line. -}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168

}178510105012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Well, whose it is?' She looked
impatiently down the line of }{ 02186512031135618 five remaining boys.
Who was out of place?}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{15186512031135618 'It's Dick Hanshaw's, Miss Robbins.'}{86512031135618

{01186512031135618 Another boy answered, with the rather repulsive tone
of self-}{02186512031135618 righteousness all children automatically
assume in reporting the }{17186512031135618 deviations of their friends
to elders in authority, 'He went }{03186512031135618 through the fire
door, Miss Robbins.'}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8

{04186512031135618 The schoolroom Door had passed on to another
combination}{9255599 }{ 15186512031135618 and Samuel Jones passed
through. One by one, the rest fol-}{-1-6186512031135618
lowed.}{86512031135618 }17819434319012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Miss
Robbins was alone in the classroom. She stepped to the }{
01186512031135618 fire door. It was a small affair, manually operated,
and hidden }{02186512031135618 behind a bend in the wall so that it
would not break up the uni-for m structure of the room.}{86512031135618
}192048480012200168 8 {01186512031135618 She opened it a crack. It was
there as a means of escape from }{186512031135618 the building in case
of fire, a device which was enforced by an }{03186512031135618
anachronistic law that did not take into account the modern
}{16186512031135618 methods of automatic fire-fighting that all public
buildings }{15186512031135618 used. There was nothing outside, but the -
outside. The sun-}{03186512031135618 light was harsh and a dusty wind
was blowing.}{86512031135618 }173038380012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Miss Robbins closed the door. She was glad she had called Mrs. Hanshaw.
She had done her duty. More than ever, it was }{16186512031135618
obvious that something was wrong with Richard. She sup-}{
02186512031135618 pressed the impulse to phone again.}{86512031135618
}16810383810012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw did not go to
New York that day. She re-}{15186512031135618 mained home in a mixture
of anxiety and an irrational anger, }{03186512031135618 the latter
directed against the impudent Miss Robbins.}{86512031135618
}187019190012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Some fifteen minutes before
school's end, her anxiety drove }{15186512031135618 her to the Door.
Last year she had had it equipped with an }{03186512031135618 automatic
device which activated it to the school's co-ordinates
}{02186512031135618 at five of three and kept it so, barring manual
adjustment, until }{01186512031135618 Richard arrived.}{86512031135618
}17810292910012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Her eyes were fixed on the
Door's dismal gray (why couldn't }{186512031135618 an inactive
force-field be any other color, something more lively
}{03186512031135618 and cheerful?) and waited. Her hands felt cold as
she squeezed }{02186512031135618 them together.}{ 86512031135618
}17819141419012200168 8 {04186512031135618 The Door turned black at the
precise second but nothing }{17186512031135618 happened. The minutes
passed and Richard was late. Then }{03186512031135618 quite late. Then
very late.}{86512031135618 }17334141434012200168 8 {16186512031135618 It
was a quarter of four and she was distracted. Normally, }{
18186512031135618 she would have phoned the school, but she couldn't,
she }{03186512031135618 couldn't. Not after that teacher had
deliberately cast doubts on Richard's mental well-being. How could
she?}{86512031135618 }16838003809255599 8 {15186512031135618 Mrs.
Hanshaw moved about restlessly, lighting a cigarette }{02186512031135618
with fumbling fingers, then smudging it out. Could it be
some-}{03186512031135618 thing quite normal? Could Richard be staying
after school for }{16186512031135618 some reason? Surely he would have
told her in advance. A }{210186512031135618 gleam of light struck her;
he knew she was planning to go}{9255599 }{18186512031135618 to New York
and might not be back till late in the evening -}{86512031135618
}17800178012200168 8 {03186512031135618 No, he would surely have told
her. Why fool herself?}{86512031135618 }182567675012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Her pride was breaking. She would have to call the
school, or }{ 02186512031135618 even (she closed her eyes and teardrops
squeezed through be-tween the lashes) the police.}{86512031135618
}17310626210012200168 8 {16186512031135618 And when she opened her eyes,
Richard stood before her, }{01186512031135618 eyes on the ground and his
whole bearing that of someone wait-}{02186512031135618 ing for a blow to
fall.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Hello,

Hanshaw's anxiety transmitted itself instantly (in a }{04186512031135618
manner known only to mothers) into anger. 'Where have you been,
Richard?'}{86512031135618 }17824343424012200168 8 {03186512031135618 And
then, before she could go further into the refrain con- cerning
careless, unthinking sons and broken-hearted mothers,
}{01186512031135618 she took note of his appearance in greater detail,
and gasped in }{04186512031135618 utter horror.}{ 86512031135618
}22100221012200168 8 {03186512031135618 She said, 'You've been in the
open.'}{86512031135618 }17834434334012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Her
son looked down at his dusty shoes (minus flexies), at }{
16186512031135618 the dirt marks that streaked his lower arms and at the
small, }{02186512031135618 but definite tear in his shirt, He said,
'Gosh, Mom, I just thought }{ 0319255599 I'd }{03186512031135618 and he
faded out.}{86512031135618 }23000230012200168 8 {02186512031135618 She
said, 'Was there anything wrong with the school Door?'}{86512031135618
}21600216012200168 8 {186512031135618 'No, Mom.'}{86512031135618

worried sick about you?' She waited }{ 15186512031135618 vainly for an
answer. 'Well, I'll talk to you afterward, young }{02186512031135618
man. First, you're taking a bath, and every stitch of your cloth-}{
04186512031135618 ing is being thrown out. Mekkano!'}{86512031135618
}17843343443012200168 8 {02186512031135618 But the mekkano had already
reacted properly to the phrase }{ 01186512031135618 'taking a bath' and
was off to the bathoom in its silent glide.}{86512031135618
}17848292948012200168 8 {17186512031135618 'You take your shoes off

Richard did as he was told with a resignation that placed him beyond
futile protest.}{ 86512031135618 }17853101053012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw picked up the soiled shoes between thumb
and }{03186512031135618 forefinger and dropped them down the disposal
chute which }{17186512031135618 hummed in faint dismay at the unexpected
load. She dusted }{02186512031135618 her hands carefully on a tissue
which she allowed to float down }{03186512031135618 the chute after the
shoes.}{86512031135618 }18762006209255599 8 {03186512031135618 She did
not join Richard at dinner but let him eat in the }{210186512031135618
worse-than-lack-of-company of the mekkano. This, she }{04186512031135618
thought, would be an active sign of her displeasure and would}{9255599
}{04186512031135618 do more than any amount of scolding or punishment to
make }{16186512031135618 him realize that he had done wrong. Richard,
she frequently }{01186512031135618 told herself, was a sensitive
boy.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {03186512031135618 But she
went up to see him at bedtime.}{86512031135618 }187105510012200168 8
{04186512031135618 She smiled at him and spoke softly. She thought that
would }{02186512031135618 be the best way. After all, he had been
punished already.}{86512031135618 }182510105012200168 8

called him that when he was a baby and just the sound of the name
softened her nearly to tears.}{86512031135618 }178010100012200168 8
{17186512031135618 But he only looked away and his voice was stubborn
and }{03186512031135618 cold. 'I just don't like to go through those

her.}{86512031135618 }1870550012200168 8 {01186512031135618 She said,
despairingly, 'Oh, well, you have a good sleep and }{03186512031135618
tomorrow morning you'll feel much better.'}{86512031135618
}182010100012200168 8 {02186512031135618 She kissed him and left the
room, automatically passing her }{03186512031135618 hand through the
photo-cell beam and in that manner dimming }{01186512031135618 the
room-lights.}{86512031135618 }178105510012200168 8 {02186512031135618
But she had trouble sleeping herself that night. Why should
}{16186512031135618 Dickie dislike Doors so suddenly? They had never
bothered }{02186512031135618 him before. To be sure, the Door had broken
down in the morn-ing but that should make him appreciate them all the
more.}{ 86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Dickie
was behaving so unreasonably.}{86512031135618 }173190019012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Unreasonably? That reminded her of Miss Robbins and
her }{02186512031135618 diagnosis and Mrs. Hanshaw's soft jaw set in the
darkness and }{03186512031135618 privacy of her bedroom. Nonsense! The
boy was upset and a }{02186512031135618 night's sleep was all the
therapy he needed.}{86512031135618 }187190019012200168 8
{02186512031135618 But the next morning when she arose, her son was not
in the house. The Mekka no could not speak but it could answer
ques-tions with gestures of its appendages equivalent to a yes or no,
}{04186512031135618 and it did not take Mrs. Hanshaw more than half a
minute to }{ 16186512031135618 ascertain that the boy had arisen thirty
minutes earlier than }{02186512031135618 usual, skimped his shower, and
darted out of the house.}{ 86512031135618 }21100211012200168 8
{02186512031135618 But not by way of the Door.}{86512031135618
}21600216012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Out the other way - through the
door. Small 'd'.}{86512031135618 }182010100012200168 8
{01186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw's vi}{0119255599 siphone signaled
genteelly at 3}{ 01186512031135618 :10 p.m. that }{02186512031135618
day. Mrs. Hanshaw guessed the caller and having activated the
}{03186512031135618 receiver, saw that she had guessed correctly. A
quick glance in }{02186512031135618 the mirror to see that she was
properly calm after a day of ab-stracted concern and worry and then she
keyed in her own }{ 01186512031135618 transmission.}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Yes, Miss Robbins,' she said
coldly.}{86512031135618 }1825005012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Richard's
teacher was a bit breathless. She said, 'Mrs. Han-}{04186512031135618
shaw, Richard has deliberately left through the fire door
al-}{03186512031135618 though I told him to use the regular Door. I do
not know where he went.'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw said, carefully, 'He left to come
home.'}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 Miss Robbins looked dismayed,
'Do you approve of this?'}{86512031135618 }1825555012200168 8
{16186512031135618 Pale-faced, Mrs. Hanshaw set about putting the
teacher in her place. 'I don't think it is up to you to criticize. If my
son }{01186512031135618 does not choose to use the Door, it is his
affair and mine. I don't }{ 17186512031135618 think there is any school
ruling that would force him to use }{02186512031135618 the Door, is
there?' Her breathing quite plainly intimated that if there were she
would see to it that it was changed.}{86512031135618 }182510105012200168
8 {02186512031135618 Miss Robbins flushed and had time for one quick
remark be-}{01186512031135618 fore contact was broken. She said, 'I'd
have him probed. I really }{02186512031135618 would.'}{86512031135618
}17310101010012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw remained
standing before the quartzinium }{186512031135618 plate, staring blindly
at its blank face. Her sense of family placed }{03186512031135618 her
for a few moments quite firmly on Richard's side. Why
}{03186512031135618 did }{ 15186512031135618 he have to use the Door if
he chose not to? And then she set-}{03186512031135618 tled down to wait
and pride battled with gnawing anxiety that }{ 02186512031135618
something after all was wrong with Richard.}{86512031135618
}17810101010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He came home with a look of
defiance on his face, but his }{17186512031135618 mother, with a
strenuous effort at self-control, met him as }{03186512031135618 though
nothing were out of the ordinary.}{86512031135618 }17814101014012200168
8 {04186512031135618 For weeks, she followed that policy. It's nothing,
she told }{ 03186512031135618 herself. It's a vagary. He'll grow out of
it.}{86512031135618 }187140014012200168 8 {17186512031135618 It grew
into an almost normal state of affairs. Then, too, }{03186512031135618
every once in a while, perhaps three days in a row, she would
}{02186512031135618 come down to breakfast to find Richard waiting
sullenly at the }{01186512031135618 Door, then using it when school time
came. She always refrained }{03186512031135618 from commenting on the
matter.}{86512031135618 }17819001909255599 8 {02186512031135618 Always,
when he did that, and especially when he followed it }{17186512031135618
up by arriving home via the Door, her heart grew warm and
}{02186512031135618 she thought, 'Well, it's over.' But always with the
passing of one}{9255599 }{02186512031135618 day, two or three, he would
return like an addict to his drug and drift silently out by the door -
small 'd' - before she woke.}{86512031135618 }178053530012200168 8
{02186512031135618 And each time she thought despairingly of
psychiatrists and }{03186512031135618 probes, and each time the vision
of Miss Robbins' low-bred }{15186512031135618 satisfaction at (possibly)
learning of it, stopped her, although }{02186512031135618 she was
scarcely aware that that was the true motive.}{86512031135618
}173538385012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Meanwhile, she lived with it
and made the best of it. The }{03186512031135618 mekkano was instructed
to wait at the door - small 'd' - with a }{01186512031135618 Tergo kit
and a change of clothing. Richard washed and changed }{02186512031135618
without resistance. His underthings, socks and flexies were
dis-}{04186512031135618 posable in any case, and Mrs. Hanshaw bore
uncomplainingly }{15186512031135618 the expense of daily disposal of
shirts. Trousers she finally }{01186512031135618 allowed to go a week
before disposal on condition of rigorous nightly
cleansing.}{86512031135618 }18214383814012200168 8 {03186512031135618
One day she suggested that Richard accompany her on a trip to New York.
It was more a vague desire to keep him in sight }{16186512031135618 than
part of any purposeful plan. He did not object. He was }{
04186512031135618 even happy. He stepped right through the Door,
unconcerned. }{15186512031135618 He didn't hesitate. He even lacked the
look of resentment he }{ 01186512031135618 wore on those mornings he
used the Door to go to school.}{86512031135618 }17819242419012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw rejoiced. This could be a way of weaning
him }{03186512031135618 back into Door usage, and she racked her
ingenuity for excuses }{04186512031135618 to make trips with Richard.
She even raised her power bill to }{18186512031135618 quite unheard-of
heights by suggesting, and going through }{03186512031135618 with, a
trip to Canton for the day in order to witness a Chinese
}{0-2186512031135618 festival.}{ 86512031135618 }17834191934012200168 8
{210186512031135618 That was on a Sunday, and the next morning Richard
}{04186512031135618 marched directly to the hole in the wall he always
used. Mrs. }{15186512031135618 Hanshaw, having wakened particularly
early, witnessed that. }{03186512031135618 For once, badgered past
endurance, she called after him plain-}{04186512031135618 tively, 'Why
not the Door, Dickie?'}{86512031135618 }16853191953012200168 8
{17186512031135618 He said, briefly, 'It's all right for Canton,' and
stepped out }{ 01186512031135618 of the house.}{86512031135618
}182625562012200168 8 {16186512031135618 So that plan ended in failure.
And then, one day, Richard }{02186512031135618 came home soaking wet.
The mekkano hovered about him un-}{16186512031135618 certainly and Mrs.
Hanshaw, just returned from a four-hour }{04186512031135618 visit with
her sister in Iowa, cried, 'Richard Hanshaw!'}{86512031135618
}178725572012200168 8 {02186512031135618 He said, hang-dog fashion, 'It
started raining. All of a sudden, }{ 03186512031135618 it started
raining.'}{86512031135618 }255000009255599 8 {15186512031135618 For a
moment, the word didn't register with her. Her own }{04186512031135618
school days and her studies of geography were twenty years in}{9255599
}{15186512031135618 the past. And then she remembered and caught the
vision of }{03186512031135618 water pouring recklessly and endlessly
down from the sky - a }{02186512031135618 mad cascade of water with no
tap to turn off, no button to push, }{03186512031135618 no contact to
break.} {86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {15186512031135618 She
said, 'And you stayed out in it?'}{86512031135618 }178100010012200168 8
{17186512031135618 He said, 'Well, gee, Mom, I came home fast as I
could. I }{03186512031135618 didn't know it was going to
rain."}{86512031135618 }173145514012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Mrs.
Hanshaw had nothing to say. She was appalled and the }{02186512031135618
sensation filled her too full for words to find a place.}{86512031135618
}178100010012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Two days later, Richard found
himself with a running nose, }{18186512031135618 and a dry, scratchy
throat. Mrs. Hanshaw had to admit that }{03186512031135618 the virus of
disease had found a lodging in her house, as though it were a miserable
hovel of the Iron Age.}{86512031135618

}187100010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 It was over that that her
stubbornness and pride broke and she }{ 16186512031135618 admitted to
herself that, after all, Richard had to have psy-}{02186512031135618
chiatric help.}{86512031135618 }1825555012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Mrs. Hanshaw chose a psychiatrist with care. Her first
im-}{02186512031135618 pulse was to find one at a distance. For a while,
she considered }{04186512031135618 stepping directly into the San
Francisco Medical Center and }{02186512031135618 choosing one at
random.}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 And then it occurred to her
that by doing that she would be-}{02186512031135618 come merely an
anonymous consultant. She would have no way }{ 01186512031135618 of
obtaining any greater consideration for herself than would be
}{17186512031135618 forthcoming to any public-Door user of the city
slums. Now }{ 04186512031135618 if she remained in her own community,
her word would carry }{15186512031135618 weight -}{86512031135618
}192510105012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She consulted the district map.
It was one of that excellent }{ 16186512031135618 series prepared by
Doors, Inc., and distributed free of charge }{18186512031135618 to their
clients. Mrs. Hanshaw couldn't quite suppress that }{ 03186512031135618
little thrill of civic pride as she unfolded the map. It wasn't a
fine-print directory of Door co-ordinates only. It was an actual
}{02186512031135618 map, with each house carefully
located.}{86512031135618 }1870000012200168 8 {16186512031135618 And why
not? District A-3 was a name of moment in the }{02186512031135618 world,
a badge of aristocracy. It was the first community on the
}{03186512031135618 planet to have been established on a completely
Doored basis. }{04186512031135618 The first, the largest, the
wealthiest, the best-known. It needed }{15186512031135618 no factories,
no stores. It didn't even need roads. Each house }{03186512031135618 was
a little secluded castle, the Door of which had entry any-where the
world over where other Doors existed.}{86512031135618 }187000009255599 8
{17186512031135618 Carefully, she followed down the keyed listing of the
five}{9255599 }{ 0-2186512031135618 thousand families of District A-3.
She knew it included several psychiatrists. The learned professions were
well represented in }{0-4186512031135618 A-3.}{ 86512031135618
}16810343410012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Doctor Hamilton Sloane was
the second name she arrived }{0-3186512031135618 at and her finger
lingered upon the map. His office was scarcely two miles from the
Hanshaw residence. She liked his name. The }{0-2186512031135618 fact
that he lived in A-3 was evidence of worth. And he was a }{
01186512031135618 neighbor, practically a neighbor. He would understand
that it }{0-1186512031135618 was a matter of urgency - and
confidential.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {0-3186512031135618
Firmly, she put in a call to his office to make an
appointment.}{86512031135618 }16824292924012200168 8 {0-3186512031135618
Doctor Hamilton Sloane was a comparatively young man, not }{
0-2186512031135618 quite forty. He was of good family and he had indeed
heard of }{0-3186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw.}{86512031135618
}17319343419012200168 8 {186512031135618 He listened to her quietly and
then said, 'And this all began }{0-1186512031135618 with the Door
breakdown.'}{86512031135618 }19700197012200168 8 {01186512031135618
'That's right, doctor.'}{86512031135618 }{186512031135618 'Does he show
any fear of the Doors?'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8
{0-1186512031135618 'Of course not. What an idea!' She was plainly
startled.}{86512031135618 }16334242434012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618
'It's possible, Mrs. Hanshaw, it's possible. After all, when you }{
02186512031135618 stop to think of how a Door works it is rather a
frightening }{03186512031135618 thing, really. You step into a Door, and
for an instant your }{ 0-1186512031135618 atoms are converted into field
energies, transmitted to another }{04186512031135618 part of space and
reconverted into matter. For that instant }{ 0-3186512031135618 you're
not alive.'}{86512031135618 }21600216012200168 8 {01186512031135618 'I'm

}17843191943012200168 8 {0-3186512031135618 'But your son may. He
witnessed the breakdown of the Door. }{186512031135618 He may be saying
to himself, "What if the Door breaks down }{02186512031135618 just as
I'm half-way through?"'}{86512031135618 }{01186512031135618 'But that's
nonsense. He still uses the Door. He's even been to Canton with me;
Canton, China. And as I told you, he uses }{0-2186512031135618 it for
school about once or twice a week.'}{86512031135618 }22100221012200168 8
{186512031135618 'Freely? Cheerfully?'}{86512031135618
}17838101038012200168 8 {186512031135618 'Well,' said Mrs. Hanshaw,
reluctantly, 'he does seem a bit put out by it. But really, Doctor,
there isn't much use talking }{ 0-2186512031135618 about it, is there?
If you would do a quick probe, see where the trouble was,' and she
finished on a bright note, 'why, that would }{01186512031135618 b e all.

}17834101034012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Dr. Sloane sighed. He
detested the word 'probe' and there }{ 0-1186512031135618 was scarcely
any word he heard oftener.}{86512031135618 }221000009255599 8
{02186512031135618 'Mrs. Hanshaw,' he said patiently, 'there is no such

mag-strips are full of it and }{04186512031135618 it's a rage in some
circles, but it's much overrated.'}{86512031135618

'Quite. The probe is very complicated and the theory is that

And even then, the results must be sent to the Central Psycho-}{

weeks. And }{03186512031135618 on top of all that, Mrs. Hanshaw, there
are many psychiatrists }{ 02186512031135618 who think the theory of

}18724141424012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw compressed her

'That often happens,' the psychiatrist assured her. 'A child }{

ready.'}{86512031135618 }182430043012200168 8 {17186512031135618 She
made a dignified exit. Dr. Sloane accompanied her }{01186512031135618
through the small reception room to his office Door and waited
}{15186512031135618 while she punched the co-ordinates of her house. He
watched }{03186512031135618 her pass through. She became a half-woman, a
quarter-woman, }{02186512031135618 an isolated elbow and foot, a
nothing.}{86512031135618 }23500235012200168 8 {02186512031135618 It
}{02186512031135618 was }{02186512031135618 frightening.}{86512031135618
}187345534012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Did a Door ever break down
during passage, leaving half a }{15186512031135618 body here and half
there? He had never heard of such a case, }{03186512031135618 but he
imagined it could happen.}{86512031135618 }18724101024012200168 8
{02186512031135618 He returned to his desk and looked up the time of his
next }{ 04186512031135618 appointment. It was obvious to him that Mrs.
Hanshaw was }{02186512031135618 annoyed and disappointed at not having
arranged for a psychic probe treatment.}{ 86512031135618
}17819141419012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Why, for God's sake? Why
should a thing like the probe, an }{ 04186512031135618 obvious piece of
quackery in his own opinion, get such a hold }{03186512031135618 on the
general public? It must be part of this general trend to-}{
02186512031135618 ward machines. Anything man can do, machines can do
better. }{03186512031135618 Machines! More machines! Machines for
anything and every-}{ 04186512031135618 thing ! O tempora! O
mores!}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Oh,

resentment of the probe was beginning to bother him. }{04186512031135618
Was it fear of technological unemployment, a basic insecurity on his
part, a mechanophobia, if that was the word -}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {01186512031135618 He made a mental note to discuss
this with his own analyst.}{86512031135618 }18210242410012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Dr. Sloane had to feel his way. The boy wasn't a
patient who }{ 04186512031135618 had come to him, more or less anxious
to talk, more or less }{01186512031135618 anxious to be
helped.}{86512031135618 }178529295012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Under
the circumstances it would have been best to keep his
}{15186512031135618 first meeting with Richard short and noncommittal.
It would }{0-1186512031135618 have been sufficient merely to establish
himself as something less }{02186512031135618 than a total stranger. The
next time he would be someone Rich-}{04186512031135618 ard had seen
before. The time after he would be an acquaint-}{02186512031135618 ance,
and after that a friend of the family.}{86512031135618
}17310343410012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Unfortunately, Mrs. Hanshaw
was not likely, to accept a long-}{ 17186512031135618 drawn-out process.
She would go searching for a probe and, }{01186512031135618 of course,
she would find it.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8
{03186512031135618 And harm the boy. He was certain of
that.}{86512031135618 }18210383810012200168 8 {02186512031135618 It was
for that reason he felt he must sacrifice a little of the proper caution
and risk a small crisis.}{ 86512031135618 }187038380012200168 8
{04186512031135618 An uncomfortable ten minutes had passed when he
decided }{02186512031135618 he must try. Mrs. Hanshaw was smiling in a
rather rigid way, }{17186512031135618 eyeing him narrowly, as though she
expected verbal magic }{03186512031135618 from him. Richard wriggled in
his seat, unresponsive to Dr. Sloane's tentative comments, overcome with
boredom and un-}{02186512031135618 able not to show it.}{86512031135618
}178245524012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Dr. Sloane said, with casual
suddenness, 'Would you like to }{04186512031135618 take a walk with me,
Richard?'}{86512031135618 }182240024012200168 8 {02186512031135618 The
boy's eyes widened and he stopped wriggling. He looked
}{04186512031135618 directly at Dr. Sloane. 'A walk,
sir?'}{86512031135618 }20600206012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'I mean,
outside.'}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {16186512031135618 'Do
you go - outside?'}{86512031135618 }{03186512031135618 'Sometimes. When
I feel like it.'}{86512031135618 }18219101019012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Richard was on his feet, holding down a squirming
eager-ness. 'I didn't think anyone did.'}{ 86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'I do. And I like
company.'}{86512031135618 }{15186512031135618 The boy sat down,
uncertainly. 'Mom? -'}{86512031135618 }17814101014012200168 8
{03186512031135618 Mrs. Hanshaw had stiffened in her seat, her
compressed lips }{ 18186512031135618 radiating horror, but she managed
to say, 'Why certainly, }{02186512031135618 Dickie. But watch
yourself.'}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8 {02186512031135618 And
she managed a quick and baleful glare at Dr. Sloane.}{86512031135618
}192519195012200168 8 {03186512031135618 In one respect, Dr. Sloane had
lied. He did }{03186512031135618 not }{ 03186512031135618 go outside
}{01186512031135618 'sometimes'. He hadn't been in the open since early
college days. }{15186512031135618 True, he had been athletically
inclined (still was to some ex-tent) but in his time the indoor
ultra-violet chambers, swim-}{17186512031135618 ming pools and tennis
courts had flourished. For those with }{ 03186512031135618 the price,
they were much more satisfactory than the outdoor equivalents, open to
the elements as they were, could possibly be. There was no occasion to
go outside.}{86512031135618

}187529295012200168 8 {17186512031135618 So there was a crawling
sensation about his skin when he }{04186512031135618 felt wind touch it,
and he put down his flexied shoes on bare }{02186512031135618 grass with
a gingerly movement.}{86512031135618 }182524245012200168 8
{04186512031135618 'Hey, look at that.' Richard was quite different now,
laugh-}{ 02186512031135618 ing, his reserve broken down.}{86512031135618
}182529295012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Dr. Sloane had time only to
catch a flash of blue that ended }{ 03186512031135618 in a tree. Leaves
rustled and he lost it.}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8
{16186512031135618 'What was it?'}{86512031135618 }{04186512031135618 'A
bird,' said Richard. 'A blue kind of bird.'}{86512031135618
}182024240012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Dr. Sloane looked about him in
amazement. The Hanshaw residence was on a rise of ground, and he could
see for miles. }{02186512031135618 The area was only lightly wooded and
between clumps of trees, }{ 03186512031135618 grass gleamed brightly in
the sunlight.}{86512031135618 }182029290012200168 8 {16186512031135618
Colors set in deeper green made red and yellow patterns.
}{02186512031135618 They were flowers. From the books he had viewed in
the course }{03186512031135618 of his lifetime and from the old video
shows, he had learned }{02186512031135618 enough so that all this had an
eerie sort of familiarity.}{86512031135618 }17810383810012200168 8
{186512031135618 And yet the grass was so trim, the flowers so
patterned. Dimly, }{03186512031135618 he realized he had been expecting
something wilder. He said, '}{02186512031135618 Who takes care of all
this?'}{86512031135618 }18700187012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Richard
shrugged. 'I dunno. Maybe the mekkanos do it.'}{86512031135618
}18200182012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'Mekkanos?'}{86512031135618
}182038380012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'There's loads of them around.
Sometimes they got a sort of }{03186512031135618 atomic knife they hold
near the ground. It cuts the grass. And }{16186512031135618 they're
always fooling around with the flowers and things. }{04186512031135618
There's one of them over there.'}{86512031135618 }178524245012200168 8
{15186512031135618 It was a small object, half a mile away. Its metal
skin cast }{ 01186512031135618 back highlights as it moved slowly over
the gleaming meadow, }{02186512031135618 engaged in some sort of
activity that Dr. Sloane could not iden-}{ 0-2186512031135618
tify.}{86512031135618 }17810292910012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Dr.
Sloane was astonished. Here it was a perverse sort of
}{03186512031135618 estheticism, a kind of conspicuous consumption
-}{86512031135618 }18200182012200168 8 {04186512031135618 'What's that?'
he asked suddenly.}{86512031135618 }16324191924012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Richard looked. He said, 'That's a house. Belongs to
the }{17186512031135618 Froehlichs. Co-ordinates, A-3, 23, 461. That
little pointy }{03186512031135618 building over there is the public
Door.'}{86512031135618 }16829191929012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Dr.
Sloane was staring at the house. Was that what it looked }{
04186512031135618 like from the outside? Somehow he had imagined
something }{02186512031135618 much more cubic, and
taller.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Come
along,' shouted Richard, running ahead.}{86512031135618
}16334191934012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Dr. Sloane followed more
sedately. 'Do you know all the }{03186512031135618 houses about
here?'}{86512031135618 }20600206012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Just
about.'}{86512031135618 }21100211012200168 8 {01186512031135618 'Where
is A-23, 26,475?' It was his own house, of course.}{86512031135618
}16348141448012200168 8 {16186512031135618 Richard looked about. 'Let's
see. Oh, sure, I know where it }{ 04186512031135618 is - you see that
water there?'}{86512031135618 }17348141448012200168 8 {04186512031135618
'Water?' Dr. Sloane made out a line of silver curving across }{
0-1186512031135618 the green.}{86512031135618 }16353141453012200168 8
{03186512031135618 'Sure. Real water. Just sort of running over rocks
and things. }{ 04186512031135618 It keeps running all the time. You can
get across it if you step }{03186512031135618 on the rocks. It's called
a river.'}{86512031135618 }17358101058012200168 8 {02186512031135618
More like a creek, thought Dr. Sloane. He had studied geo-}{
15186512031135618 graphy, of course, but what passed for the subject
these days }{186512031135618 was really economic and cultural geography.
Physical geography }{ 01186512031135618 was almost an extinct science
except among specialists. Still, he }{186512031135618 knew what rivers
and creeks were, in a theoretical sort of way.}{86512031135618

}18762006208397639 8 {03186512031135618 Richard was still talking.
'Well, just past the river, over that }{ 211186512031135618 hill with

}197010100012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 Some small animal disturbed
the grass in its anxiety to avoid }{ 0-1186512031135618 the oncoming
feet. Richard looked after it and shrugged. 'You }{01186512031135618
can't catch them. I tried.'}{86512031135618 }182014140012200168 8
{0-2186512031135618 A butterfly flitted past, a wavering bit of yellow.
Dr. Sloane's }{ 0-4186512031135618 eyes followed it.}{86512031135618
}1820550012200168 8 {01186512031135618 There was a low hum that lay over
the fields, interspersed }{0-1186512031135618 with an occasional harsh,
calling sound, a rattle, a twittering, a }{0-3186512031135618 chatter
that rose, then fell. As his ear accustomed itself to
listen-}{0-1186512031135618 ing, Dr. Sloane heard a thousand sounds, and
none were man-}{-1-5186512031135618 made.}{86512031135618
}178510105012200168 8 {0-2186512031135618 A shadow fell upon the scene,
advancing toward him, cover- ing him. It was suddenly cooler and he
looked upward, startled.}{86512031135618 }1825005012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Richard said, 'It's just a cloud. It'll go away in a
minute -}{0-1186512031135618 look at these flowers. They're the kind
that smell.'}{86512031135618 }1785555012200168 8 {01186512031135618 They
were several hundred yards from the Hanshaw resi-}{02186512031135618
dence. The cloud passed and the sun shone once more. Dr.
}{0-2186512031135618 Sloane looked back and was appalled at the distance
they had covered. If they moved out of sight of the house and if Richard
ran off, would he be able to find his way back?}{86512031135618
}182010100012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 He pushed the thought away

(nearer now) and past it to where his }{186512031135618 own house must

'Mrs. Hanshaw, he's as normal as need be right now. Right now, he's
tasting the joys of the for-bidden. If you co-operate with him, show
that you don't disap-prove, it will lose some of its attraction right
there. Then, as he }{ 01186512031135618 grows older, he will become more
aware of the expectations and }{15186512031135618 demands of society. He
will learn to conform. After all, there }{ 04186512031135618 is a little
of the rebel in all of us, but it generally dies down as

}{17186512031135618 He turned and said vehemently, 'No, definitely not!

}5555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Surprises work both ways, I
explained in my introduction to }{15186512031135618 'Nightfall' that its
success had been completely unexpected. }{04186512031135618 Well, in the
case of 'Strikebreaker', I thought I had a block-}{03186512031135618
buster. It seemed to me to be fresh and original; I felt it
con-}{02186512031135618 tained a stirring sociological theme, with lots
of meaning, and }{01186512031135618 with considerable pathos. Yet, as
nearly as I can make out, it }{04186512031135618 dropped silently into
the sea of audience reaction without as }{01186512031135618 much as
marki ng out a single circular ripple on its surface.}{86512031135618
}16810101010012200168 8 {16186512031135618 But I can be stubborn about
such things. If I like a story, I }{186512031135618 like it, and I
include it here to give the audience a second chance.}{86512031135618
}1875555012200168 8 {186512031135618 This is one of those stories where
I can remember the exact oc-}{03186512031135618 casion that put it into
my mind. It involved one of my periodic }{15186512031135618 trips to New
York which have, more and more, become a kind }{03186512031135618 of
highlight to my life. They are the only occasions on which I
}{04186512031135618 can stop writing for as much as three or four days
at a time }{02186512031135618 without feeling either guilty or
restless.}{86512031135618 }1780000012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Naturally, anything that would tend to interfere with one of }{

sang-froid. }{15186512031135618 Actually, I would throw a fit. It was
bad enough when some-}{ 186512031135618 thing enormous would get in my
way - a hurricane or a blizzard, }{01186512031135618 for instance. But a
subway strike? And not of all the subway }{ 03186512031135618 employees,
but only a few key men, say thirty-five. They would }{210186512031135618
stall the entire subway and, with that, the entire city. And }{
01186512031135618 if the strike came to pass, I could scarcely venture
into a stalled }{0-2186512031135618 city.}{86512031135618
}178100010012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Where will this all end?' I
apostrophized the heavens in my }{ 01186512031135618 best tragical
manner, one fist raised high and the other clenched }{186512031135618 in
my hair. 'A mere handful of men can paralyze an entire mega-lopolis.
Where will it end?"}{ 86512031135618 }163190019012200168 8
{15186512031135618 My gesture remained frozen as, in thought, I carried
the }{ 04186512031135618 situation to its logical extreme. I carefully
unhooked the ges-}{02186512031135618 ture, went upstairs, and wrote
'Strikebreaker.'}{86512031135618

}182295529012200168 8 {04186512031135618 The happy ending is that the

{01186512031135618 (Lamorak thought of his first view of Elsevere from
the }{0-3186512031135618 spaceship visiplate. It was a jagged, airless
planetoid, some hun-}{0-1186512031135618 dred miles in diameter - just a
dust-gray rough-hewn rock, }{0-2186512031135618 glimmering dully in the
light of its sun, 200,000,000 miles dis-}{186512031135618 tant. It was
the only object more than a mile in diameter that }{01186512031135618
circled that sun, and now men had burrowed into that
minia-}{0-2186512031135618 ture world and constructed a society in it.
And he himself, as a sociologist, had come to study the world and see
how humanity }{ 0-1186512031135618 had made itself fit into that queerly
specialized niche.)}{86512031135618 }187019190012200168 8

us by two-dimen-}{0-3186512031135618 sional standards. The surface area
of Elsevere is only three quar-}{ 04186512031135618 ters that of the
State of New York, but that's irrelevant. }{0-1186512031135618 Remember,
we can occupy, if we wish, the entire interior of }{ 0-3186512031135618
Elsevere. A sphere of 50 miles radius has a volume of well over
}{0-1186512031135618 half a million cubic miles. If all of Elsevere were
occupied by }{ 0-2186512031135618 levels 50 feet apart, the total
surface area within the planetoid would be 56,000,000 square miles, and
that is equal to the total }{01186512031135618 land area of Earth. And
none of these square miles, Doctor, }{0-1186512031135618 would be
unproductive.'}{86512031135618 }17810101010012200168 8

interest. It was an eight-page tabloid of synthetic paper. One

habitable volume (not area! three dimensions!). The remainder included
scholarly essays, }{ 01186512031135618 educational material, and

for what sight Blei might be }{186512031135618 evading. His gaze swept
over the close-by horizons of lined rock }{02186512031135618 and the

alone made it note-}{02186512031135618 worthy. He had already seen th at

on WGBH, }{02186512031135618 Boston's educational TV station. With me
were John Hansen, a }{15186512031135618 technical writer of directions
for using machinery, and David }{04186512031135618 O. Woodbury, the
well-known science writer.}{86512031135618 }197145514012200168 8
{01186512031135618 We all bemoaned the inadequacy of most science
writing and }{ 15186512031135618 technical writing and the}{15113525150
re was some comment on my proli}{15186512031135618 ficity. With my usual
modesty, I attributed my success entirely }{01186512031135618 to an
incredible fluency of ideas and a delightful facility in
writ-}{15186512031135618 ing. I stated incautiously that I could write a
story anywhere, }{02186512031135618 any time, under any conditions

there with the television cameras on me.}{86512031135618
}197010100012200168 8 {04186512031135618 I accepted the challenge and

discussion. The other two did not try to }{01186512031135618 make life
easier for me, either. They deliberately kept interrupt-}{
04186512031135618 ing in order to drag me into their discussion and
interrupt my }{01186512031135618 'line of thought, and I was just vain

Before that half-hour program was over I had finished and }{
15186512031135618 read the story (which is why it is so short, by the
way) and it was the one you see here as 'Insert Knob A in Hole B.' In
his }{03186512031135618 own introduction to the story, when it appeared
in F &SF, Mr. }{15186512031135618 Boucher said he was printing it just
as it was (I had sent him }{04186512031135618 the handwritten script,
after typing a copy for myself) 'even to }{16186512031135618 the
retention of its one grammatical error.' I have kept that

finding.}{86512031135618 }17824101024012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I
cheated, though. (Would I lie to you?) The three of us were }{
02186512031135618 talking before the program started and somehow I got
the idea }{04186512031135618 they might ask me to write a story on the
program. So, just in }{ 01186512031135618 case they did, I spent a few
minutes before its start blocking out something.}{86512031135618
}18224191924012200168 8 {03186512031135618 Consequently, when they asked
me, I had it roughly in mind. }{ 01186512031135618 All I had to do was
work out the details, write it down, and then }{15186512031135618 read
it. After all, I had twenty minutes.}{86512031135618

{02186512031135618 I have frequently (rather to my own uneasy surprise)
been ac-}{04186512031135618 cused of writing humorously. Oh, I try, I
try, but only very cautiously, and for a long time I thought nobody
noticed.}{86512031135618 }17810434310012200168 8 {15186512031135618 You
see, there is no margin for error in humor. You can try }{
04186512031135618 to write suspense and not quite hit the mark, and have
a story }{03186512031135618 that is only moderately suspenseful. In
analogous manner, you }{ 01186512031135618 can have a story be only
moderately romantic, moderately excit-}{02186512031135618 ing,
moderately eerie, even moderately science-fictiony.}{ 86512031135618
}17814343414012200168 8 {03186512031135618 But what happens when you
miss the mark in humor? Is the result moderately humorous? Of course
not! The not-quite-humorous remark, the not-quite-witty rejoinder, the
not-quite-}{01186512031135618 farcical episode are, respectively,
dreary, stupid, and ridiculous.}{86512031135618 }17824292924012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Well, with a target that is all bull's-eye and no
larger than a }{186512031135618 bull's-eye at that, am I going to blaze
away carelessly? Certainly }{04186512031135618 not! I'm fantastically
courageous, but I'm not stupid.}{86512031135618 }17324242424012200168 8
{15186512031135618 So I have tried being funny only occasionally, and
usually }{ 18186512031135618 only gently and unobtrusively (as in
'Nobody Here But ') }{04186512031135618 On the few occasions in which I
tried to write a purely funny }{ 03186512031135618 story, I wasn't
completely satisfied.}{86512031135618 }17334242434012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Mostly, therefore, I kept my stories grave and sober
(as you }{ 0-1186512031135618 can tell).}{86512031135618
}18234141434012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Yet, I never quite gave up,
either. One day, at the prodding }{ 18186512031135618 of Mr. Boucher, I
tried my hand at a Gilbert and Sullivan }{02186512031135618 parody and
finally (in my own eyes, at any rate) I clicked with- out reservation. I
read the story over and laughed heartily.}{86512031135618
}19238191938012200168 8 {18186512031135618 That was it. I had found my
metier in humor. All I had to }{ 01186512031135618 do was to assume a
very slightly exaggerated pseudo-Victorian }{04186512031135618 style and
I found I had no trouble at all in being funny.}{ 86512031135618
}178435543012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Did I enter a full-fledged
career as science fiction humorist }{ 01186512031135618 at once? Not at
all. I kept the humor at the previous level and }{15186512031135618
remained, for the most part, grave and sober. That's still what I do
best.}{ 86512031135618 }197290029012200168 8 {03186512031135618 However,
in the middle 1960s, I took to writing a series of }{ 02186512031135618
articles for }{02186512031135618 TV Guide }{02186512031135618 which are
nothing but this kind of humor, }{ 18186512031135618 and I love them. (I
am sometimes taken to task, by the way, }{04186512031135618 for saying,
in my artless way, that I like my own material, but why shouldn't I? Is
it conceivable that I would spend seventy }{16186512031135618 hours a

family, present on some pretext. He is }{03186512031135618 a Justice of

{15186512031135618 The Senior Dance was, of course, the event of the
year. The }{18186512031135618 young men shone and the young ladies
glittered. The music }{04186512031135618 lilted and the dancing feet
touched the ground only at intervals. }{01186512031135618 Joy was
unrestrained.}{ 86512031135618 }17843919143012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Or, rather, it was unrestrained in most cases.
Alexander Dex-}{186512031135618 ter stood in one corner, eyes hard,
expression icily bleak. Straight }{04186512031135618 and handsome he
might be, but no young woman approached }{02186512031135618 him. He was
known to belong to Alice S anger, and under such }{03186512031135618
circumstances, no college girl would dream of poaching. Yet

Alexander and Alexander's pride pre-}{ 16186512031135618 vented him from

only watch the circulating couples cautiously.}{86512031135618

clothes that did not fit although }{ 03186512031135618 made to measure,
approached him. He said, 'I will add my hor}{18186512031135618 mone to

{02186512031135618 'I saw him a moment ago. In his capacity as chaperon

}173290029012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Alexander, despite his sore

along those principles firmly adhered to by all. }{17186512031135618
young college students. It contains only the purest of fruit

'Good,' said the professor. 'Now I have added to the hormone }{

of the opposite sex }{15186512031135618 - will inspire that individual

Alexander, depressed nearly to tears, stepped out to the bal-}{

}17382343482012200168 8 {03186512031135618 They crowded about the punch

round.}{86512031135618 }17386141486012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'To

15186512031135618 thusiasm of young college students, downed the fiery
mixture }{16186512031135618 of pure fruit juices, sugar, and lemon peel,
with - of course -}{ 03186512031135618 the professor's sedated

{01186512031135618 As the fumes rose to their brains, they slowly
crumpled to the }{ -1-5186512031135618 floor.}{86512031135618
}180014140015991070 8 {01186512031135618 Alice stood there alone, still
holding her drink, eyes wet with }{ 02186512031135618 unshed tears. 'Oh,
Alexander, Alexander, though you doubt, yet}{15991070
}{04186512031135618 are you my only love. You wish me to drink and I
shall drink.' }{ 03186512031135618 Then she, too, sank gracefully
downward.}{86512031135618 }1730000012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Nicholas Nitely had gone in search of Alexander, for whom
}{03186512031135618 his warm heart was concerned. He had seen him arrive
without }{02186512031135618 Alice and he could only assume that a
lovers' quarrel had taken place. Nor did he feel any dismay at leaving
the party to its own }{ 03186512031135618 devices. These were not wild
youngsters, but college boys and }{17186512031135618 girls of good
family and gentle upbringing. They could be }{ 15186512031135618 trusted
to the full to observe the four-finger limit, as he well

}1785555012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Alexander, my boy.' He put his

chut.'}{86512031135618 }1735005012200168 8 {03186512031135618
Alexander's head bowed at the sound of the good old man's
}{02186512031135618 voice. 'It is unmanly, I know, but I yearn for
Alice. I have been cruel to her and I am justly treated now. And yet,
Mr. Nitely, if you could but know -' He placed his clenched fist on his
chest, }{04186512031135618 next his heart. He could say no
more.}{86512031135618 }168105510012200168 8 {15186512031135618 Nitely

Time was when I, too, knew love and heartbreak. But do not do as I did
once and allow pride to prevent your re-}{01186512031135618 union. Seek
her out, my boy, seek her out and apologize. Do not }{02186512031135618
allow yourself to become a solitary old bachelor such as I,

{03186512031135618 Then go on in. For shortly before I came out, I
believe I saw her there.'}{86512031135618

}178195519012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Alexander's heart leaped.

But, no. Go you first, Mr. Nitely, while I stay }{01186512031135618
behind to recover myself. I would not have her see me a prey to womanish

{02186512031135618 Nitely stopped at the door into the ballroom in
astonishment. Had a universal catastrophe struck all low? Fifty couples
were }{01186512031135618 lying on the floor, some heaped together most
indecorously.}{ 86512031135618 }178562625012200168 8 {04186512031135618
But before he could make up his mind to see if the nearest
}{186512031135618 were dead, to sound the fire alarm, to call the
police, to anything, }{04186512031135618 they were rousing and
struggling to their feet.}{86512031135618 }182538385012200168 8
{02186512031135618 Only one still remained. A lonely girl in white, one
arm out-}{ 03186512031135618 stretched gracefully beneath her fair head.
It was Alice Sanger }{02186512031135618 and Nitely hastened to her,
oblivious to the rising clamor about }{ 01186512031135618
him.}{86512031135618 }178538385012200168 8 {01186512031135618 He sank to
his knees. 'Miss Sanger. My dear Miss Sanger. Are }{ 18186512031135618
you hurt?'}{86512031135618 }17819626219012200168 8 {04186512031135618
She opened her beautiful eyes slowly, and said, 'Mr. Nitely! }{

loveliness.'}{86512031135618 }17814292914012200168 8 {03186512031135618
'I?' Nitely started back with horror, but she had now risen to }{
02186512031135618 her feet and there was a light in her eyes such as
Nitely had not seen in a maiden's eyes for thirty years - and then only
weakly.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 She
said, 'Mr. Nitely, surely you will not leave me?'}{86512031135618
}19700197012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'No, no,' said Nitely, confused.

{02186512031135618 'I need you. I need you with all my heart and soul. I

}17814141414012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Nitely, still backing away,
looked about hastily, to see if any- one could be hearing this unusual
declaration, but no one seemed }{03186512031135618 to be paying any
attention. As nearly as he could make out, the }{01186512031135618 air
was filled with other declarations of similar sort, some being
}{03186512031135618 even more forceful and direct.}{86512031135618
}178240024012200168 8 {02186512031135618 His back was up against a wall,
and Alice approached him so }{186512031135618 closely as to break the
four-finger rule to smithereens. She broke, }{04186512031135618 in fact,
the no-finger rule, and at the resulting mutual pressure, a certain
indefinable something seemed to thud away within }{ 01186512031135618
Nitely.}{86512031135618 }21600216012200168 8 {03186512031135618 'Miss

{02186512031135618 'Miss Sanger? Am I Miss Sanger to you?' exclaimed
Alice, }{03186512031135618 passionately. 'Mr. Nitely! Nicholas! Make me
your Alice, your }{17186512031135618 own. Marry me. Marry
me!'}{86512031135618 }182380038012200168 8 {03186512031135618 All around
there was the cry of 'Marry me. Marry me!' and young men and women
crowded ar ound Nitely, for they knew }{04186512031135618 well that he
was a Justice of the Peace. They cried out, 'Marry }{18186512031135618
us, Mr Nitely. Marry us!'}{ 86512031135618 }22100221012200168 8

They parted to let him leave on that errand of mercy. Only }{

turned}{15991070 }{ 15186512031135618 him back toward the open and fresh
air. Professor Johns came }{04186512031135618 at that moment to join
them all.}{86512031135618 }15814676714012200168 8 {04186512031135618
Nitely said, 'Alexander}{04115991070 .}{ 04186512031135618 Professor

}173058580012200168 8 {02186512031135618 'Yes,' said the professor, his
mild face beaming with joy. 'The experiment has been a success. The
principle is far more effect-}{04186512031135618 ive on the human being,
in fact, than on any of my experimen-}{ 02186512031135618 tal animals.'
Noting Nitely's confusion, he explained what had }{03186512031135618
occurred in brief sentences.}{86512031135618 }17310484810012200168 8
{15186512031135618 Nitely listened and muttered, 'Strange, strange.
There is a }{ 03186512031135618 certain elusive familiarity about this.'
He pressed his forehead }{15186512031135618 with the knuckles of both
hands, but it did not help.}{ 86512031135618 }17314434314012200168 8
{04186512031135618 Alexander approached Alice gently, yearning to clasp
her to }{ 17186512031135618 his strong bosom, yet knowing that no gently
nurtured girl }{04186512031135618 could consent to such an expression of
emotion from one who }{ 03186512031135618 had not yet been

there, my - my }{04186512031135618 dear.' He patted Alice's head in a
most fatherly way and when }{ 02186512031135618 she held her enticing
face up toward his, swooningly, he con-sidered whether it might not be a

hand (his right }{ 01186512031135618 arm being firmly in the clutch of

your hold the merest trifle, my child, so that circulation

tenderness that made her beauty as bewitching as moonlight

{0-1186512031135618 But Nitely walked rapidly into his study, and she
was forced }{ 0-2186512031135618 to run with him. His face was white,
his lips firm, as he reached }{0-3186512031135618 for a volume from the

{02186512031135618 'Professor,' said Nitely. 'This dear child referred

in-}{01186512031135618 tention of gauging the direction of the
inevitable thunderbolt and }{03186512031135618 dodging. He said in a
hoarse whisper, 'Sir William Schwenck Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan
wrote, respectively, the words }{ 02186512031135618 and music of the
greatest musical comedies the world has ever }{03186512031135618 seen.
One of these is entitled }{03186512031135618 The Sorcerer.
}{03186512031135618 In it, too, a philtre }{16186512031135618 was used:
a highly moral one which did not affect married }{186512031135618
people, but which did manage to deflect the young heroine away
}{02186512031135618 from her handsome young lover and into the arms of
an elderly }{03186512031135618 man.'}{ 86512031135618
}173485548012200168 8 {186512031135618 'And,' Asked Professor Johns,

fictional plot to real life, perhaps the solution in }{02186512031135618

{03186512031135618 'There is something', said Nitely, 'to be said for

solution in the play, Professor Johns, and it is for that reason
}{02186512031135618 that I most particularly wanted to talk to you.' He
smiled with a }{01186512031135618 gentle benevolence. 'In the play, the
effects of the potion were }{02186512031135618 completely neutralized by
the actions of the gentleman who ad-}{03186512031135618 ministered the
potion in the first place: the gentleman, in other }{02186512031135618

recovered his equilibrium }{02186512031135618 and said in the most
sepulchrally forceful tone that could be }{03186512031135618 imagined,
'My dear sir, may I state instantly that, despite my }{02186512031135618
affection for t he young persons involved in this sad dilemma, I
}{15186512031135618 cannot under any circumstances consent to
self-immolation. }{01115991070 Such }{ 01186512031135618 a procedure
might be extremely efficacious in connection }{16186512031135618 with
love potions of ordinary vintage, but my amatogenic }{ 01186512031135618
principle, I assure you, would be completely unaffected by my

{02186512031135618 Nitely sighed. 'I feared that. As a matter of fact,
between our-}{186512031135618 selves, it was a very poor ending for the
play, perhaps the poorest }{03186512031135618 in the canon,' and he
looked up briefly in mute apology to the }{15186512031135618 spirit of
William S. Gilbert. 'It was pulled out of a hat. It had
}{03186512031135618 not been properly foreshadowed earlier in the play.
It punished an individual who did not deserve the punishment. In short,
it was, alas, completely unworthy of Gilbert's powerful
genius.'}{86512031135618 }15872141472012200168 8 {16186512031135618
Professor Johns said, 'Perhaps it was not Gilbert. Perhaps }{

{02186512031135618 But Professor Johns, his scientific mind keenly
aroused by an}{15991070 }{ 0-3186512031135618 unsolved puzzle, said at
once, "We can test this. Let us study the }{01186512031135618 mind of

}1825005012200168 8 {04186512031135618 To be sure,' muttered Professor
Johns, who realized that }{0-3186512031135618 such an eventuality
frequently befell bad baronets and was even }{186512031135618 inclined
to think it served them right.}{86512031135618 }173510105012200168 8

does not affect mar-ried people - loses its power over them. Those who

were subjected, the incidence }{0-1186512031135618 of undue pressure

my head in pity and sympathy. Obviously, the poor }{0-4186512031135618

one reason or another, were enamored of him. At the }{0-1186512031135618
thought of this horrible fate, I downed my own drink at a gulp }{

Boucher retired as editor of F & SF, and was succeeded in

}1780550012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Mr. Mills proceeded to do me the
largest single favor of my }{ 02186512031135618 writing life since Mr.
Campbell had started the discussion that }{03186512031135618 had led to
'Nightfall'. Mr. Mills asked me to write a monthly }{ 01186512031135618
column on science for F & SF and I complied at once. Since the
}{186512031135618 November 1958 issue, in which my first column
appeared, I have }{ 15186512031135618 kept right on going, month after
month, and, as I write this, I }{02186512031135618 am about to celebrate
my tenth anniversary as monthly column-}{ 03186512031135618 ist for the
magazine.}{86512031135618 }1970000012200168 8 {01186512031135618 Of all
the writing I do, fiction, non-fiction, adult, or juvenile, }{
02186512031135618 these F & SF articles are by far the most fun, and in
them, dur-}{19186512031135618 ing Mr. Mills' tenure I never referred to
him as other than }{ 15186512031135618 the 'Kindly
Editor'.}{86512031135618 }1780550012200168 8 {02186512031135618 Anyway,
over lunch one day, Mr. Mills said he had seen the }{ 15186512031135618
name Lefkowitz on several different and unrelated occasions
}{04186512031135618 that day, which struck him as a curious coincidence.
Could I }{ 16186512031135618 make a story out of it? In my usual offhand
manner, I said, }{03186512031135618 'Sure!' and gave it a little
thought.}{86512031135618 }197014140012200168 8 {186512031135618 The
result was a story that served as a tribute to Mr. Boucher,
}{04186512031135618 too. He was, you see, a devout Catholic. (I must say
'was', for }{02186512031135618 he died in April 1968 to the heartfelt
grief of all who knew him. }{17186512031135618 He was so kind a man that
he was loved by the very authors }{01186512031135618 he rejected, even
while he was rejecting them, and there simply isn't any harsher test of
true love than that.) And because Mr. }{ 186512031135618 Boucher was a
sincere Catholic, there was very often a faintly }{01186512031135618
Catholic air about F & SF under his leadership; always a plea-}{
15186512031135618 sant and liberal one, though, for that was the kind of
man he }{0-4186512031135618 was.}{86512031135618 }1735005012200168 8
{16186512031135618 So I thought thai as my tribute to Mr. Boucher's
editorship, }{ 15186512031135618 I would try my hand at that kind of
flavor myself. I couldn't }{04186512031135618 handle it
Catholic-fashion, of course, for I am not Catholic. I }{
03186512031135618 did it the only way I could manage, and wrote a Jewish
story -the only Jewish story it ever occurred to me to write, I
think.}{86512031135618 }187510105012200168 8 {02186512031135618 And I

reservoir.}{86512031135618 }17810101010012200168 8 {04186512031135618 It
was nearer ten minutes than two, and Marten waited with the usual
uneasiness of a man in a strange office. He stared at
}{03186512031135618 the upholstery on the chairs and at the little
cubby-hole within }{ 02186512031135618 which a young and bored
switchboard operator sat. He gazed at }{15186512031135618 the pictures
on the wall and even made a half-hearted attempt }{ 04186512031135618 to
glance through a trade journal on the table next to him.}{86512031135618

restaurant was good, or it would have been good if
Mar-}{01186512031135618 ten had been perfectly at ease. Fortunately, he
was freed of the }{04186512031135618 necessity of carrying the burden of
the conversation. Naylor }{03186512031135618 talked rapidly and loudly,
glanced over the menu with a prac-}{02186512031135618 ticed eye,
recommended the Eggs Benedict, and commented on the weather and the
miserable traffic situation.}{ 86512031135618 }187290029012200168 8
{04186512031135618 On occasion, Martin tried to snap out of it, to lose
that edge }{186512031135618 of fuzzed absence of mind. But each time the
restlessness would }{16186512031135618 return. Something was wrong. The
name was wrong. It stood }{04186512031135618 in the way of what he had
to do.}{86512031135618 }180000004544042 8 {16186512031135618 With main
force, he tried to break through the madness. In}{4544042 }{
15186512031135618 sudden verbal clatter, he led the conversation into
the subject }{02186512031135618 of wiring. It was reckless of him. There
was no proper founda-}{ 04186512031135618 tion; the transition was too
abrupt.}{86512031135618 }18210484810012200168 8 {16186512031135618 But

}19210383810012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He admitted dissatisfaction

sounded }{15186512031135618 more peremptory than he
intended.}{86512031135618 }18724343424012200168 8 {02186512031135618

}17310676710012200168 8 {04186512031135618 And yet, through and beyond

restlessness.}{86512031135618 }182062620012200168 8 {02186512031135618

{16186512031135618 He left with pulses thudding, threading through the

haunted street.}{86512031135618 }17314484814012200168 8 {0214544042

of the normal within him warned him he had a three o'clock
appoint-}{04186512031135618 ment on 36th Street. Never mind. He headed
uptown. North-}{0-1186512031135618 ward.}{86512031135618

pace.}{86512031135618 }20200202012200168 8 {04186512031135618 It was

protruded. His }{01186512031135618 grizzled beard reached the uppermost
button of his rough jacket. }{03186512031135618 His old trousers were

for some }{01186512031135618 half a dozen issues or so, a magazine I

call 'spicy science fiction stories.' Con-}{02186512031135618 sidering

with the hot passion of alien }{ 02186512031135618 monsters for

and breasts were described in a variety of elliptical phrases. }{
02186512031135618 (Yes, I know that's a pun.) The magazine died a

that all science fiction was sex }{04186512031135618 and sadism. They
could find very little real stuff to satirize, }{01186512031135618
however, for until 1960 there was no branch of literature
any-}{17186512031135618 where (except perhaps for the children's stories
in Sunday }{01186512031135618 school bulletins) as puritanical as

Marge Skidmore was suddenly completely aware of her
sur-}{0-2186512031135618 roundings. She remembered very clearly the
elevated station at the beginning of twilight. It had been almost empty,
one man }{0-1186512031135618 standing near her, another at the other end
of the platform. The approaching train had just made itself known as a
faint rumble }{0-2186512031135618 in the distance.}{86512031135618
}182190019012200168 8 {0-1186512031135618 There had then come the flash,
a sense of turning inside out, the half-seen vision of a spindly
creature, dripping mucus, a }{0-4186512031135618 rushing upward, and now
}{86512031135618 }173295529012200168 8 {186512031135618 'Oh, God,' she

{01186512031135618 She felt a sick revulsion, but no fear. She was
almost proud}{12138559 }{ 04186512031135618 of herself for feeling no
fear. The man next to her, standing quietly as she herself was, but
still wearing a battered fedora, }{15186512031135618 was the one that
had been near her on the platform.}{86512031135618 }19200192012200168 8

Charlie Grimwold, feeling flabby and paunchy, tried to lift }{
04186512031135618 his hand to remove his hat and smooth the thin hair
that broke }{02186512031135618 up but did not entirely cover the skin of
his scalp and found that }{ 03186512031135618 it moved only with
difficulty against a rubbery but hardening }{02186512031135618
resistance. He let his hand drop and looked morosely at the thin-}{
03186512031135618 faced woman facing him. She was in her middle
thirties, he de-cided, and her hair was nice and her dress fit well, but
at the }{02186512031135618 moment, he just wanted to be somewhere else
and it did him no }{03186512031135618 good at all that he had company;

{0-2186512031135618 'Well,' Botax flashed a short purple patch of
embarrassment. }{186512031135618 'This forms a complicated ritual. They

'I don't think I had better tell the smaller form to remove the }{

closely. I have here sections of those space-travel tales which the man
from the "Re-}{0-1186512031135618 creationlad" periodical spoke highly
of. In those tales the skins }{0-2186512031135618 are removed forcibly.
Here is a description of an accident, for }{186512031135618 instance
"which played havoc with the girl's dress, ripping it
}{0-1186512031135618 nearly off her slim body. For a second, he felt the
warm firm-}{0-3186512031135618 ness of her half-bared bosom against his

{04186512031135618 'Apparently,' said Botax. 'The strange surroundings,

that an outer-world species performs the task. For instance,

{04186512031135618 'Reluctance. Reluctance,' said Botax. 'Besides, the
bosom is still covered. Other skins must be removed. When bared, the
bosom is a very strong stimulus. It is constantly described as

with fair firmness.}{86512031135618 }187385538012200168 8

leaped away "with a }{03186512031135618 wild cry, holding his lower lip,

prepared the }{0-3186512031135618 ship for departure Botax hastily set

{03186512031135618 Toward the end of the 1950s some rather unexpected
changes }{02186512031135618 took place in my life. My writing career had
been constantly }{03186512031135618 expanding. I had been driven on by
my own compulsion and by }{16186512031135618 editorial coope ration to
undertake more and more tasks in }{186512031135618 greater and greater
variety and by 1958 I found that I could no }{18186512031135618 longer
do the writing I wanted to do and maintain a full }{01186512031135618
academic schedule.}{86512031135618 }19724101024012200168 8
{03186512031135618 The Medical School and I came to an amicable
understand-}{ 15186512031135618 ing, therefore. I kept my title
(Associate Professor of Bio-}{186512031135618 chemistry, if you're
curious') and continued to do odd jobs, like }{ 02186512031135618 giving
several lectures a year, sitting on committees, and so on.
}{01186512031135618 In the main, however, I became a full-time writer
.and relieved }{ 04186512031135618 them of the trouble of paying me a
salary.}{86512031135618 }187100010012200168 8 {02186512031135618 For a
while, it seemed to me that with virtually no academic }{186512031135618
duties and an infinite amount of time each and every day, I could
}{02186512031135618 finally do all the writing I had to do with plenty
of time left over }{04186512031135618 for fun and games.}{86512031135618
}192514145012200168 8 {02186512031135618 It didn't work out. One of
Parkinson's laws is: 'Work expands to fill the time available.' It did
in my case. In no time at all, I found I was typing as assiduously
full-time as I had previously }{15186512031135618 been typing half-time
and I quickly discovered the Asimov }{0-1186512031135618 corollary to
Parkinson's law: 'In ten hours a day you have time to
}{16186512031135618 fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five
hours a }{0-1186512031135618 day.'}{86512031135618 }19710292910012200168
8 {15186512031135618 The worst of it was that just about the time I was
arranging to make myself a full-time writer, the Soviet Union sent up
}{02186512031135618 Sputnik I and the United States went into a kind of
tizzy, and so }{ 15186512031135618 did I.}{86512031135618
}182534345012200168 8 {02186512031135618 I was overcome by the ardent
desire to write popular science }{ 01186512031135618 for an America that
might be in great danger through its neglect }{04186512031135618 of
science, and a number of publishers got an equally ardent }{
186512031135618 desire to publish popular science for the same reason.
As a result }{17186512031135618 of combining the two ardencies I found
myself plunging into }{ 03186512031135618 a shoreless sea in which I am
still immersed.}{86512031135618 }19210535310012200168 8
{02186512031135618 The trouble is - it's all non-fiction. In the last
ten years, I've }{ 01186512031135618 done a couple of novels, some
collections, a dozen or so stories, }{03186512031135618 but that's
}{03186512031135618 nothing.}{ 86512031135618 }17806262009376902 8
{01186512031135618 From the aggrieved letters I get, one would think I
was doing this on purpose. I'm }{ 01186512031135618 not.
}{01193769029376902 I}{01193769029376902 }{01186512031135618 try
desperately not to lose touch with }{02186512031135618 science fiction
altogether. It's my life in a way that nothing else}{9376902
}{0-1186512031135618 can quite be. There's my monthly article in F &
}{0-1186512031135618 SF, }{0-1186512031135618 of course, but that's not
quite the same thing.}{86512031135618 }18729101029012200168 8
{186512031135618 And so it happens that each short individual piece of
fiction }{02186512031135618 I manage to get the typewriter to put out
for me is dearer to }{186512031135618 me in the nowadays of my dimness,

looked down the long and empty main corridor of the enormous
}{0-3186512031135618 computer. He sat down rather wearily in one of the
technician's }{ 0-4186512031135618 swing-stools, and his uniform, in
which he had never been com-}{0-2186512031135618 fortable, took on a

Henderson, thin-lipped and finding it hard to control
}{15186512031135618 the relief he felt in the midst of triumph, said,
'They're des-}{16186512031135618 troyed! They're destroyed! It's what I
keep saying to myself }{02186512031135618 over and over and I still
can't believe it. We all talked so much, }{04186512031135618 over so
many years, about the menace hanging over Earth and }{03186512031135618
all its worlds, over every human being, and all the time it was true,

Jablonsky, who through all the war had been }{04186512031135618 Chief

}17819141419012200168 8 {04186512031135618 Jablonsky shrugged.
Automatically, he reached for a cigar-}{ 03186512031135618 ette and
decided against it. He alone, of all the thousands who
}{02186512031135618 had lived in the tunnels within Multivac, had been
allowed to }{ 01186512031135618 smoke, but toward the end he had made
definite efforts to avoid }{02186512031135618 making use of the
privilege.}{86512031135618 }17824141424012200168 8 {03186512031135618 He
said. 'Well, that's what }{03186512031135618 they }{ 03186512031135618
say.' His broad thumb moved }{04186512031135618 in the direction of his

to me? Let }{03186512031135618 Multivac be the machine that won the war,

{04186512031135618 Henderson looked at the other two out of the corners

corner of a metropolis gone mad; }{03186512031135618 in this entr'acte

remove any such manuscripts that had inadvertently found

}178019190012200168 8 {01186512031135618 I'll never forget the shock
that rumbled through the entire }{ 0-1186512031135618 world of science

86512031135618 }{0-4186512031135618 Nowadays, it is routine to find
science fiction writers and their }{0-3186512031135618 science fiction
in such wide-circulation markets as }{ 0-3186512031135618 Playboy.
}{0-3186512031135618 In-}{0-2186512031135618 deed, the competition of
the mass markets is such that the small }{ 01186512031135618 speciality

{01186512031135618 But the strangest market for science fiction, in my
opinion, }{ 0-3186512031135618 was the advertising columns of that
excellent and, for me, in-}{0-2186512031135618 dispensable) periodical,
}{0-2186512031135618 Scientific American. }{0-2186512031135618 It seems
that a }{186512031135618 company called Hoffman Electronics Corporation
got the idea }{0-3186512031135618 of running a series of advertisements
that would include a two-}{0-4186512031135618 page (minus one column)
illustrated science fiction story - real }{0-3186512031135618 science
fict ion stories by the acknowledged masters. The final
}{0-2186512031135618 column would then be used to promote their product
in a digni-}{0-4186512031135618 fied manner. There was no direct tie-in
between story and ad-}{186512031135618 vertising and the writer was to
have carte blanche, except that }{01186512031135618 it would be nice t o
have the story involve communications in one form or another (since
communications technology was }{0-2186512031135618 what Hoffman was
selling).}{86512031135618 }182345534012200168 8 {0-3186512031135618 The
challenge was interesting and artistic integrity was pre-}{

program, I ac-}{186512031135618 cepted and wrote 'My Son, the

communications but is in no way a 'commercial' for such
}{0-1186512031135618 things. Hoffman accepted the story without changing
