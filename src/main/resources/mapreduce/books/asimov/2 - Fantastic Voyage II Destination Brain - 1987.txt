  CHAPTER 1 -- NEEDED

 

  HE WHO IS NEEDED MUST LEARN TO ENDURE FLATTERY.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  1.

 

  "PARDON ME. DO YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN?" SAID THE LOW VOICE, DEFINITELY
CONTRALTO, IN HIS EAR.

 

  ALBERT JONAS MORRISON STIFFENED IN HIS SEAT. THE ROOM WAS DARKENED AND
THE COMPUTER SCREEN ON THE PLATFORM WAS DISPLAYING ITS GRAPHICS WITH AN
INSISTENCE THAT HAD BEEN LOST ON HIM.

 

  HE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HALF-ASLEEP. THERE HAD DEFINITELY BEEN A
MAN ON HIS RIGHT WHEN HE SAT DOWN. WHEN HAD THAT MAN CHANGED INTO A
WOMAN? OR RISEN AND BEEN REPLACED?

 

  MORRISON CLEARED HIS THROAT AND SAID, "DID YOU SAY SOMETHING, MA'AM?"
HE COULDN'T MAKE HER OUT CLEARLY IN THE DIM ROOM AND THE FLASHING LIGHT
FROM THE COMPUTER SCREEN OBSCURED RATHER THAN REVEALED. HE MADE OUT DARK
HAIR, STRAIGHT, HUGGING THE SKULL, COVERING THE EARS -- NO ARTIFICE.

 

  SHE SAID, "I ASKED IF YOU SPOKE RUSSIAN."

 

  "YES, I DO. WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?"

 

  "BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. MY ENGLISH SOMETIMES FAILS ME. ARE
YOU DR. MORRISON? A. J. MORRISON? I'M NOT CERTAIN IN THIS DARKNESS.
FORGIVE ME IF I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE."

 

  "I AM A. J. MORRISON. DO I KNOW YOU?"

 

  "NO, BUT I KNOW YOU." HER HAND REACHED OUT, TOUCHING THE SLEEVE OF HIS
JACKET LIGHTLY. "I NEED YOU BADLY. ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS TALK? YOU
DID NOT SEEM TO BE."

 

  THEY WERE BOTH WHISPERING, OF COURSE.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED ABOUT INVOLUNTARILY. THE ROOM WAS SPARSELY FILLED AND
NO ONE WAS SITTING VERY CLOSE. HIS WHISPER GREW LOWER JUST THE SAME.
"AND IF I'M NOT? WHAT THEN?" (HE WAS CURIOUS -- IF ONLY OUT OF BOREDOM.
THE TALK HAD PUT HIM TO SLEEP.)

 

  SHE SAID, "WILL YOU COME WITH ME NOW? I AM NATALYA BORANOVA."

 

  "COME WITH YOU WHERE, MS. BORANOVA?"

 

  "TO THE COFFEE SHOP -- SO THAT WE MAY TALK. IT IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT."

 

  THAT WAS THE WAY IT BEGAN. IT DIDN'T MATTER, MORRISON DECIDED
AFTERWARD, THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THAT PARTICULAR ROOM -- THAT HE HAD NOT
BEEN ALERT -- THAT HE HAD BEEN INTRIGUED ENOUGH, FLATTERED ENOUGH TO BE
WILLING TO GO WITH A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE NEEDED HIM.

 

  SHE WOULD, AFTER ALL, HAVE FOUND HIM WHEREVER HE HAD BEEN AND WOULD
HAVE SEIZED UPON HIM AND WOULD HAVE MADE HIM LISTEN. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN QUITE SO EASY UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IT WOULD ALL HAVE GONE
AS IT DID. HE WAS CERTAIN.

 

  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO ESCAPE.

 

  2.

 

  HE WAS LOOKING AT HER IN NORMAL LIGHT NOW, AND SHE WAS LESS YOUNG THAN
HE HAD THOUGHT. THIRTY-SIX? FORTY, PERHAPS?

 

  DARK HAIR. NO GRAY. PRONOUNCED FEATURES. HEAVY EYEBROWS. STRONG JAWS.
PLEASANT NOSE. STURDY BODY, BUT NOT FAT. ALMOST AS TALL AS HE WAS, EVEN
THOUGH SHE WAS WEARING FLAT HEELS. ON THE WHOLE, A WOMAN WHO WAS
ATTRACTIVE WITHOUT BEING BEAUTIFUL. THE KIND OF WOMAN, HE DECIDED, ONE
COULD GET USED TO.

 

  HE SIGHED, FOR HE WAS FACING THE MIRROR AND HE SAW HIMSELF THERE.
SANDY HAIR, THINNING. BLUE EYES, FADED. THIN FACE, THIN BODY, STRINGY.
BEAKY NOSE, NICE SMILE. HE HOPED IT WAS A NICE SMILE. BUT NO, NOT A FACE
YOU WOULD WANT TO GET USED TO. BRENDA HAD GOTTEN ENTIRELY UNUSED TO IT
IN A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS, AND HIS FORTIETH BIRTHDAY WOULD BE FIVE DAYS
PAST THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY HIS DIVORCE HAD BEEN MADE FINAL
AND OFFICIAL.

 

  THE WAITRESS BROUGHT THE COFFEE. THEY HAD BEEN SITTING THERE, NOT
TALKING BUT APPRAISING EACH OTHER. MORRISON FINALLY FELT HE HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING.

 

  "NO VODKA?" HE SAID IN AN ATTEMPT AT LIGHTNESS.

 

  SHE SMILED AND LOOKED SOMEHOW EVEN MORE RUSSIAN WHEN SHE DID SO. "NO
COCA-COLA?"

 

  "IF THAT'S AN AMERICAN HABIT, COCA-COLA IS AT LEAST CHEAPER."

 

  "FOR GOOD REASON."

 

  MORRISON LAUGHED. "ARE YOU THIS QUICK IN RUSSIAN?"

 

  "LET US SEE IF I AM. LET'S TALK RUSSIAN."

 

  "WE'LL SOUND LIKE A COUPLE OF SPIES."

 

  HER LAST SENTENCE HAD BEEN IN RUSSIAN. SO HAD MORRISON'S REPLY. THE
CHANGE OF LANGUAGE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM. HE COULD SPEAK AND
UNDERSTAND IT AS EASILY AS ENGLISH. THAT HAD TO BE SO. IF AN AMERICAN
WISHED TO BE A SCIENTIST AND KEEP UP WITH THE LITERATURE, HE HAD TO BE
ABLE TO HANDLE RUSSIAN, ALMOST AS MUCH AS A RUSSIAN SCIENTIST HAD TO BE
ABLE TO HANDLE ENGLISH.

 

  THIS WOMAN, NATALYA BORANOVA, FOR INSTANCE, DESPITE HER PRETENCE THAT
SHE WAS NOT AT HOME IN ENGLISH, SPOKE IT READILY AND WITH ONLY A FAINT
ACCENT, MORRISON NOTICED.

 

  SHE SAID, "WHY WILL WE SOUND LIKE SPIES? THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS SPEAKING ENGLISH IN THE SOVIET UNION AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF SOVIET CITIZENS SPEAKING RUSSIAN IN THE UNITED STATES.
THESE ARE NOT THE BAD OLD DAYS."

 

  "THAT'S TRUE. I WAS JOKING. BUT IN THAT CASE, WHY DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK
RUSSIAN?"

 

  "THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY AND THAT GIVES YOU A PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE,
DOES IT NOT, DR. MORRISON? IF WE SPEAK MY LANGUAGE, IT WILL BALANCE THE
SCALES A BIT."

 

  MORRISON SIPPED AT HIS COFFEE. "AS YOU WISH."

 

  "TELL ME, DR. MORRISON. DO YOU KNOW ME?"

 

  "NO. I HAVE NEVER MET YOU BEFORE."

 

  "AND MY NAME? NATALYA BORANOVA? HAVE YOU HEARD OF ME?"

 

  "FORGIVE ME. IF YOU WERE IN MY FIELD, I WOULD HAVE HEARD OF YOU. SINCE
I HAVE NOT, I ASSUME YOU ARE NOT IN MY FIELD. SHOULD I KNOW YOU?"

 

  "IT MIGHT HAVE HELPED, BUT WE'LL LET IT GO. I KNOW YOU, HOWEVER. IN
FACT, I KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU. WHEN AND WHERE YOU WERE BORN. YOUR
SCHOOLING. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DIVORCED AND THAT YOU HAVE TWO
DAUGHTERS THAT LIVE WITH YOUR EX-WIFE. I KNOW ABOUT YOUR UNIVERSITY
POSITION AND THE RESEARCH YOU DO."

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "NONE OF THAT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND OUT IN OUR
COMPUTER-RIDDEN SOCIETY. SHOULD I BE FLATTERED OR ANNOYED?"

 

  "WHY EITHER?"

 

  "IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU TELL ME THAT I AM FAMOUS IN THE SOVIET
UNION, WHICH WOULD BE FLATTERING, OR THAT I HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF AN
INVESTIGATION, WHICH MIGHT BE ANNOYING."

 

  "I HAVE NO INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING BUT HONEST WITH YOU. I HAVE
INVESTIGATED YOU -- FOR REASONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME."

 

  MORRISON SAID COLDLY, "WHAT REASONS?"

 

  "TO BEGIN WITH, YOU ARE A NEUROPHYSICIST."

 

  MORRISON HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE AND HAD ABSENTLY SIGNALED FOR A
REFILL. BORANOVA'S CUP WAS HALF-EMPTY, BUT SHE HAD APPARENTLY LOST
INTEREST IN IT.

 

  "THERE ARE OTHER NEUROPHYSICISTS," MORRISON SAID.

 

  "NONE LIKE YOU."

 

  "CLEARLY YOU ARE TRYING TO FLATTER ME. THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE YOU
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME AFTER ALL. NOT THE CRUCIAL THINGS."

 

  "THAT YOU ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL? THAT YOUR METHODS OF BRAIN WAVE ANALYSIS
ARE NOT GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE FIELD?"

 

  "BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT, THEN WHY ARE YOU AFTER ME?"

 

  "BECAUSE WE HAVE A NEUROPHYSICIST IN OUR COUNTRY WHO KNOWS YOUR WORK,
AND HE THINKS IT IS BRILLIANT. YOU HAVE RATHER JUMPED INTO THE UNKNOWN,
HE SAYS, AND YOU MAY BE WRONG -- BUT IF YOU ARE, YOU ARE BRILLIANTLY
WRONG."

 

  "BRILLIANTLY WRONG? HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM WRONG?"

 

  "IT IS HIS VIEW THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE BRILLIANTLY WRONG WITHOUT
BEING NOT ALTOGETHER WRONG. EVEN IF YOU ARE IN SOME WAYS WRONG, MUCH OF
WHAT YOU MAINTAIN WILL PROVE USEFUL -- AND YOU MAY BE ENTIRELY RIGHT."

 

  "WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS PARAGON WHO HAS THIS VIEW OF ME? I'LL
MENTION HIM WITH FAVOR IN MY NEXT PAPER."

 

  "HE IS PYOTOR LEONOVICH SHAPIROV. DO YOU KNOW HIM?"

 

  MORRISON SAT BACK IN HIS CHAIR. HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THIS. "KNOW HIM?"
HE SAID. "I'VE MET HIM. PETE SHAPIRO I CALLED HIM. OUR PEOPLE HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES THINK HE'S AS CRAZY AS I AM. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT HE'S
BACKING ME, THAT'S JUST ONE MORE NAIL IN MY COFFIN. -- LISTEN, TELL PETE
I APPRECIATE HIS FAITH IN ME, BUT IF HE REALLY WANTS TO HELP ME, PLEASE
ASK HIM NOT TO TELL ANYONE HE'S ON MY SIDE."

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AT HIM DISAPPROVINGLY. "YOU ARE NOT A VERY SERIOUS
MAN. IS EVERYTHING A JOKE TO YOU?"

 

  "NO. JUST ME. I'M THE JOKE. I'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY GREAT AND I
CAN'T CONVINCE ANYONE OF IT. EXCEPT PETE -- I'VE NOW FOUND OUT -- AND HE
DOESN'T COUNT. I CAN'T EVEN GET MY PAPERS PUBLISHED THESE DAYS."

 

  "THEN COME TO THE SOVIET UNION. WE CAN USE YOU -- AND YOUR IDEAS."

 

  "NO NO. I'M NOT EMIGRATING."

 

  "WHO SAID EMIGRATE? IF YOU WISH TO BE AN AMERICAN, BE AN AMERICAN. BUT
YOU HAVE VISITED THE SOVIET UNION IN THE PAST AND YOU CAN VISIT IT ONCE
AGAIN AND STAY A WHILE. THEN RETURN TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY."

 

  "WHY?"

 

  "YOU HAVE CRAZY IDEAS AND WE HAVE CRAZY IDEAS. PERHAPS YOURS CAN HELP
OURS."

 

  "WHAT CRAZY IDEAS? I MEAN, YOURS. I KNOW WHAT MINE ARE."

 

  "IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO DISCUSS UNTIL I KNOW IF YOU ARE PERHAPS WILLING
TO HELP US."

 

  MORRISON, STILL SITTING BACK IN HIS CHAIR, WAS VAGUELY AWARE OF THE
BUZZ ABOUT HIM, OF PEOPLE DRINKING, EATING, TALKING -- MOST OF THEM FROM
THE CONFERENCE, HE WAS SURE. HE STARED AT THIS INTENSE RUSSIAN WOMAN WHO
ADMITTED TO CRAZY IDEAS AND WONDERED WHAT KIND OF--

 

  HE STIFFENED AND CRIED OUT, "BORANOVA! I HAVE HEARD OF YOU. OF COURSE.
PETE SHAPIRO MENTIONED YOU. YOU'RE --"

 

  IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE WAS SPEAKING ENGLISH AND HER HAND CAME DOWN ON
HIS, HER NAILS PRESSING HARD AGAINST HIS SKIN.

 

  HE CHOKED IT OFF AND SHE REMOVED HER HAND, SAYING, "SORRY. I DID NOT
MEAN TO HURT YOU."

 

  HE STARED AT THE MARKS ON HIS HAND, ONE OF WHICH, HE DECIDED, WAS
GOING TO BE SLIGHTLY BRUISED. HE SAID QUIETLY IN RUSSIAN, "YOU'RE THE
MINIATURIZER."

 

  3.

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EASY CALM. "PERHAPS A LITTLE WALK AND A
BENCH BY THE RIVER. THE WEATHER IS BEAUTIFUL."

 

  MORRISON HELD HIS LIGHTLY DAMAGED HAND IN THE OTHER. THERE HAD BEEN A
FEW, HE THOUGHT, WHO HAD LOOKED IN HIS DIRECTION WHEN HE HAD CRIED OUT
IN ENGLISH, BUT NONE SEEMED TO SHOW ANY INTEREST NOW. HE SHOOK HIS HEAD.
"I THINK NOT. I SHOULD BE ATTENDING THE CONFERENCE."

 

  BORANOVA SMILED AS THOUGH HE HAD AGREED THAT THE WEATHER WAS
BEAUTIFUL. "I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK YOU'LL FIND A SEAT BY THE RIVER
MORE INTERESTING."

 

  FOR ONE FLASHING MOMENT, MORRISON THOUGHT HER SMILE MIGHT BE INTENDED
TO BE SEDUCTIVE. SURELY SHE WASN'T IMPLYING --

 

  HE ABANDONED THE THOUGHT ALMOST BEFORE HE HAD PUT IT CLEARLY TO
HIMSELF. THAT SORT OF THING WAS PASS‚ EVEN ON HOLOVISION: "BEAUTIFUL
RUSSIAN SPY USES SINUOUS BODY TO DAZZLE NAIVE AMERICAN."

 

  TO BEGIN WITH, SHE WASN'T BEAUTIFUL AND HER BODY WASN'T SINUOUS. NOR
DID SHE LOOK AS THOUGH ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE COULD POSSIBLY BE ON HER
MIND AND HE HIMSELF, AFTER ALL, WASN'T THAT NAIVE -- OR EVEN INTERESTED.

 

  YET HE FOUND HIMSELF ACCOMPANYING HER ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND TOWARD THE
RIVER.

 

  THEY WALKED SLOWLY -- SAUNTERED -- AND SHE TALKED CHEERFULLY ABOUT HER
HUSBAND NIKOLAI AND HER SON ALEKSANDR, WHO WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AND WAS,
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY, EVEN THOUGH HIS MOTHER
WAS A THERMODYNAMICIST. WHAT'S MORE, ALEKSANDR WAS A DREADFUL CHESS
PLAYER, MUCH TO HIS FATHER'S DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT HE SHOWED SIGNS OF
PROMISE ON THE VIOLIN.

 

  MORRISON DID NOT LISTEN. HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF, INSTEAD, IN TRYING TO
RECALL WHAT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE SOVIET INTEREST IN MINIATURIZATION
AND WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION THERE MIGHT BE BETWEEN THAT AND HIS OWN
WORK.

 

  SHE POINTED TO A BENCH. "THIS ONE LOOKS REASONABLY CLEAN."

 

  THEY SAT DOWN. MORRISON STARED OVER THE RIVER, WATCHING, WITH EYES
THAT DID NOT REALLY ABSORB IT, THE LINE OF CARS FILING ALONG THE HIGHWAY
ON THEIR SIDE AND THE PARALLEL LINE ON THE HIGHWAY ON THE OTHER SIDE --
WHILE SCULLS, LOOKING LIKE CENTIPEDES, PLIED THE RIVER ITSELF.

 

  HE REMAINED SILENT AND BORANOVA, STARING AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY, FINALLY
SAID, "YOU DO NOT FIND THIS INTERESTING?"

 

  "FIND WHAT INTERESTING?"

 

  "MY SUGGESTION THAT YOU COME TO THE SOVIET UNION."

 

  "NO!" HE SAID IT CURTLY.

 

  "BUT WHY NOT? SINCE YOUR AMERICAN COLLEAGUES DO NOT ACCEPT YOUR IDEAS,
AND SINCE YOU ARE DEPRESSED OVER THIS AND ARE SEEKING A WAY OUT OF THE
DEAD END AT WHICH YOU HAVE ARRIVED, WHY NOT COME TO US?"

 

  "GIVEN YOUR INVESTIGATIONS INTO MY LIFE, I AM SURE YOU KNOW THAT MY
IDEAS ARE NOT ACCEPTED, BUT HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE SURE THAT I AM ALL
THAT DEPRESSED OVER IT?"

 

  "ANY SANE MAN WOULD BE DEPRESSED. AND ONE HAS ONLY TO TALK TO YOU TO
BE CERTAIN."

 

  "DO YOU ACCEPT MY IDEAS?"

 

  "I? I AM NOT IN YOUR FIELD. I KNOW NOTHING -- OR VERY LITTLE -- ABOUT
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM."

 

  "I SUPPOSE YOU SIMPLY ACCEPT SHAPIROV'S ESTIMATE OF MY IDEAS."

 

  "YES. AND EVEN IF I DID NOT -- DESPERATE PROBLEMS MAY REQUIRE
DESPERATE REMEDIES. WHAT HARM, THEN, IF WE TRY YOUR IDEAS AS A REMEDY?
IT WILL CERTAINLY LEAVE US NO WORSE OFF."

 

  "SO YOU HAVE MY IDEAS. THEY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED."

 

  SHE GAZED AT HIM STEADILY. "SOMEHOW WE DON'T THINK ALL YOUR IDEAS HAVE
BEEN PUBLISHED. THAT IS WHY WE WANT YOU."

 

  MORRISON LAUGHED WITHOUT HUMOR. "WHAT GOOD CAN I POSSIBLY DO YOU IN
CONNECTION WITH MINIATURIZATION? I KNOW LESS ABOUT MINIATURIZATION THAN
YOU DO ABOUT THE BRAIN. FAR LESS."

 

  "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "ONLY TWO THINGS. THAT THE SOVIETS ARE KNOWN TO BE INVESTIGATING IT --
AND THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE."

 

  BORANOVA STARED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE RIVER. "IMPOSSIBLE? WHAT IF I TOLD
YOU WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK?"

 

  "I WOULD AS SOON BELIEVE YOU IF YOU TOLD ME POLAR BEARS FLY."

 

  "WHY SHOULD I LIE TO YOU?"

 

  "I POINT OUT THE FACT. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOTIVATION."

 

  "WHY ARE YOU SO CERTAIN MINIATURIZATION IS IMPOSSIBLE?"

 

  "IF YOU REDUCE A MAN TO THE DIMENSIONS OF A FLY, THEN ALL THE MASS OF
A MAN WOULD BE CROWDED INTO THE VOLUME OF A FLY. YOU'D END UP WITH A
DENSITY OF SOMETHING LIKE --" HE PAUSED TO THINK -- "A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THOUSAND TIMES THAT OF PLATINUM."

 

  "BUT WHAT IF THE MASS WERE REDUCED IN PROPORTION?"

 

  "THEN YOU END UP WITH ONE ATOM IN THE MINIATURIZED MAN FOR EVERY THREE
MILLION IN THE ORIGINAL. THE MINIATURIZED MAN WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE THE
SIZE OF A FLY BUT THE BRAINPOWER OF A FLY AS WELL."

 

  "AND IF THE ATOMS ARE REDUCED, TOO?"

 

  "IF IT IS MINIATURIZED ATOMS YOU ARE SPEAKING OF, THEN PLANCK'S
CONSTANT, WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL QUANTITY IN OUR UNIVERSE,
FORBIDS IT. MINIATURIZED ATOMS WOULD BE TOO SMALL TO FIT INTO THE
GRAININESS OF THE UNIVERSE."

 

  "AND IF I TOLD YOU THAT PLANCK'S CONSTANT WAS REDUCED AS WELL, SO THAT
A MINIATURIZED MAN WOULD BE ENCASED IN A FIELD IN WHICH THE GRAININESS
OF THE UNIVERSE WAS INCREDIBLY FINER THAN IT IS UNDER NORMAL
CONDITIONS?"

 

  "THEN I WOULDN'T BELIEVE YOU."

 

  "WITHOUT EXAMINING THE MATTER? YOU WOULD REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT AS A
RESULT OF PRECONCEIVED CONVICTIONS, AS YOUR COLLEAGUES REFUSE TO BELIEVE
YOU?"

 

  AND AT THIS, MORRISON WAS, FOR A MOMENT, SILENT.

 

  "NOT THE SAME," HE MUMBLED AT LAST.

 

  "NOT THE SAME?" AGAIN SHE STARED THOUGHTFULLY OUT OVER THE RIVER. "IN
WHAT WAY NOT THE SAME?"

 

  "MY COLLEAGUES THINK I'M WRONG. MY IDEAS ARE NOT THEORETICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE IN THEIR OPINION -- ONLY WRONG."

 

  "WHILE MINIATURIZATION IS IMPOSSIBLE?"

 

  "YES."

 

  "THEN COME AND SEE. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT MINIATURIZATION IS
IMPOSSIBLE, JUST AS YOU SAY, THEN YOU'LL AT LEAST HAVE A MONTH IN THE
SOVIET UNION AS A GUEST OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT. ALL EXPENSES WILL BE
PAID. IF THERE'S A FRIEND YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING WITH YOU, BRING HER,
TOO. OR HIM."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO THANKS. I'D RATHER NOT. EVEN IF
MINIATURIZATION WERE POSSIBLE, IT IS NOT MY FIELD. IT WOULD NOT HELP ME
OR BE OF INTEREST TO ME."

 

  "HOW DO YOU KNOW? WHAT IF MINIATURIZATION GAVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO
STUDY NEUROPHYSICS AS YOU HAVE NEVER STUDIED IT BEFORE -- AS NO ONE HAS
EVER STUDIED IT BEFORE? AND WHAT IF, IN DOING SO, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP US? THAT WOULD BE OUR STAKE IN IT."

 

  "HOW CAN YOU OFFER ME A NEW WAY OF STUDYING NEUROPHYSICS?"

 

  "BUT, DR. MORRISON, I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU
CANNOT REALLY PROVE YOUR THEORIES BECAUSE YOU CANNOT STUDY SINGLE NERVE
CELLS IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL WITHOUT DAMAGING THEM. BUT WHAT IF WE MAKE A
NEURON AS LARGE AS THE KREMLIN FOR YOU -- OR EVEN LARGER -- SO THAT YOU
CAN STUDY IT A MOLECULE AT A TIME?"

 

  "YOU MEAN YOU CAN REVERSE MINIATURIZATION AND MAKE A NEURON AS LARGE
AS YOU WISH."

 

  "NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT, AS YET, BUT WE CAN MAKE YOU AS SMALL AS WE WISH
AND THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO THE SAME THING, WOULDN'T IT?"

 

  MORRISON ROSE, STARING AT HER.

 

  "NO," HE SAID IN HALF A WHISPER. "ARE YOU INSANE? DO YOU THINK I AM
INSANE? GOOD-BYE! GOOD-BYE!"

 

  HE TURNED AND STRODE AWAY RAPIDLY.

 

  SHE CALLED AFTER HIM. "DR. MORRISON. LISTEN TO ME."

 

  HE MADE A SWEEPING GESTURE OF REJECTION WITH HIS RIGHT ARM AND BROKE
INTO A RUN ACROSS THE DRIVE, NARROWLY DODGING THE CARS.

 

  THEN HE WAS BACK INTO THE HOTEL, PUFFING, ALMOST DANCING WITH
IMPATIENCE AS HE WAITED FOR THE ELEVATOR.

 

  MADWOMAN! HE THOUGHT. SHE WANTED TO MINIATURIZE HIM, ATTEMPT THIS
IMPOSSIBILITY ON HIM. -- OR ATTEMPT THE POSSIBILITY OF IT ON HIM, WHICH
WOULD BE INFINITELY WORSE.

 

  4.

 

  MORRISON WAS STILL SHAKING WHEN HE STOOD AT THE DOOR OF HIS HOTEL
ROOM, HOLDING THE PLASTIC RECTANGLE OF HIS KEY, BREATHING HARD, AND
WONDERING IF SHE KNEW HIS ROOM NUMBER. SHE COULD FIND OUT, OF COURSE, IF
SHE WERE SUFFICIENTLY DETERMINED. HE LOOKED DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE
CORRIDOR EACH WAY, HALF-AFRAID HE MIGHT SEE HER RUNNING TOWARD HIM, FACE
CONTORTED, HAIR FLYING, HANDS OUTSTRETCHED.

 

  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD. THIS WAS MADNESS. WHAT COULD SHE DO TO HIM? SHE
COULD NOT CARRY HIM OFF BODILY. SHE COULD NOT FORCE HIM TO DO ANYTHING
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO. WHAT CHILDISH TERROR WAS OVERCOMING HIM?

 

  MORRISON TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND THRUST HIS KEY INTO THE DOOR SLIT. HE
FELT THE SMALL CLICK AS THE KEY SEATED ITSELF, THEN HE WITHDREW IT AND
THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN.

 

  THE MAN SITTING IN THE WICKER ARMCHAIR AT THE WINDOW SMILED AT HIM AND
SAID, "COME IN."

 

  MORRISON STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT, THEN TWISTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK
AT THE ROOM NUMBER.

 

  "NO NO. IT'S YOUR ROOM, ALL RIGHT. DO COME IN AND CLOSE THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU."

 

  MORRISON FOLLOWED ORDERS, STARING AT THE MAN IN SILENT ASTONISHMENT.

 

  HE WAS A COMFORTABLY PLUMP MAN, NOT QUITE FAT, FILLING THE CHAIR FROM
ARM TO ARM. HE WORE A THIN SEERSUCKER JACKET AND UNDER IT WAS A SHIRT SO
WHITE THAT IT SEEMED TO GLISTEN. HE WAS NOT YET WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL
BALD, BUT HE WAS CLEARLY ON THE WAY AND WHAT REMAINED OF HIS BROWN HAIR
WAS CRISPLY CURLY. HE DID NOT WEAR GLASSES, BUT HIS EYES WERE SMALL AND
HAD A NEARSIGHTED LOOK ABOUT THEM, WHICH MIGHT BE MISLEADING -- OR WHICH
PERHAPS MEANT HE WORE CONTACTS.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU CAME BACK RUNNING, DIDN'T YOU? I WATCHED YOU --" HE
POINTED OUT THE WINDOW -- "SITTING ON THE BENCH, THEN GET UP AND COME
TOWARD THE HOTEL AT THE DOUBLE. I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD COME UP TO YOUR
HOTEL ROOM. I DIDN'T WANT TO SIT UP HERE ALL DAY WAITING FOR YOU."

 

  "YOU WERE HERE IN ORDER TO WATCH ME FROM THE WINDOW?"

 

  "NO, NOT AT ALL. THAT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT. YOU JUST HAPPENED TO WALK
OUT WITH THE LADY TO THAT BENCH. CONVENIENT, BUT NOT REALLY FORESEEN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, THOUGH. IF I HADN'T HAD THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW, THERE
WERE OTHERS WATCHING."

 

  BY THAT TIME MORRISON HAD CAUGHT HIS BREATH AND HIS MIND HAD STEADIED
ITSELF TO THE POINT WHERE HE ASKED THE QUESTION THAT SHOULD HAVE HAD
PRIDE OF PLACE IN THE CONVERSATION. "WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?"

 

  IN RESPONSE THE MAN, SMILING, TOOK A SMALL WALLET FROM HIS INNER
JACKET POCKET AND LET IT FLIP OPEN. HE SAID, "SIGNATURE, HOLOGRAM,
FINGERPRINT, VOICEPRINT."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED FROM THE HOLOGRAM TO THE SMILING FACE. THE HOLOGRAM
WAS SMILING, TOO. HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE SECURITY. IT STILL
DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO BREAK INTO MY PRIVATE QUARTERS. I'M
AVAILABLE. YOU COULD HAVE CALLED ME FROM THE LOBBY OR KNOCKED AT MY
DOOR."

 

  "STRICTLY SPEAKING, YOU'RE RIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO
MEET YOU AS DISCREETLY AS POSSIBLE. BESIDES, I PRESUMED ON OLD
ACQUAINTANCE."

 

  "WHAT OLD ACQUAINTANCE?"

 

  "TWO YEARS AGO. DON'T YOU REMEMBER? AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN
MIAMI? YOU WERE PRESENTING A PAPER AND HAD A HARD TIME OF IT --"

 

  "I REMEMBER THE OCCASION. I REMEMBER THE PAPER. IT'S YOU I DON'T
REMEMBER."

 

  "THAT'S NOT SURPRISING, PERHAPS. I MET YOU AFTERWARD. I ASKED YOU
QUESTIONS, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A FEW DRINKS TOGETHER."

 

  "I DON'T CONSIDER THAT OLD ACQUAINTANCE. -- FRANCIS RODANO?"

 

  "THAT'S MY NAME, YES. YOU EVEN PRONOUNCED IT CORRECTLY. ACCENT ON THE
SECOND SYLLABLE. BROAD A. SUBLIMINAL MEMORY, OBVIOUSLY."

 

  "NO, I DON'T REMEMBER YOU. THE NAME WAS ON YOUR IDENTIFICATION. -- I'D
RATHER YOU LEFT."

 

  "I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY."

 

  "APPARENTLY EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK TO ME. WHAT ABOUT?"

 

  "YOUR WORK."

 

  "ARE YOU A NEUROPHYSICIST?"

 

  "YOU MUST KNOW I'M NOT. SLAVIC LANGUAGES WAS MY MAJOR. I MINORED IN
ECONOMICS."

 

  "THEN WHAT CAN WE TALK ABOUT? I'M GOOD AT RUSSIAN, BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
BETTER. AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ECONOMICS."

 

  "WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR WORK. AS WE DID TWO YEARS AGO. -- LOOK, WHY
DON'T YOU SIT DOWN? IT'S YOUR ROOM AND I WON'T REALLY TAKE LONG. IF YOU
WANT THE CHAIR I'M SITTING ON, I'LL BE GLAD TO GIVE IT TO YOU."

 

  MORRISON SAT DOWN AT THE SIDE OF THE BED. "LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY WORK?"

 

  "THE SAME THING I WANTED TO KNOW TWO YEARS AGO. IS THERE ANYTHING TO
YOUR NOTION THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE IN YOUR BRAIN THAT'S
SPECIFICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATIVE THOUGHT?"

 

  "NOT QUITE A STRUCTURE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CUT OUT IN THE
ORDINARY WAY. IT'S A NEURONIC NETWORK. YES, I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO
THAT. OBVIOUSLY. THE CATCH IS THAT NO ONE ELSE THINKS SO BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T LOCATE IT AND HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR IT."

 

  "HAVE YOU LOCATED IT?"

 

  "NO. I REASON BACKWARD FROM RESULTS AND FROM MY ANALYSIS OF BRAIN
WAVES AND I DON'T SEEM TO BE CONVINCING. MY ANALYSES ARE NOT --
ORTHODOX." HE ADDED BITTERLY, "ORTHODOXY IN THIS FIELD HAS GOTTEN THEM
NOWHERE, BUT THEY WON'T LET ME BE UNORTHODOX."

 

  "I AM TOLD THAT YOU USE MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES IN YOUR
ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ANALYSES THAT ARE NOT ONLY UNORTHODOX, BUT ARE
FLAT WRONG. TO BE UNORTHODOX IS ONE THING; TO BE WRONG IS QUITE
ANOTHER."

 

  "THE ONLY REASON THEY SAY I AM WRONG IS THAT I CANNOT PROVE THAT I AM
RIGHT. THE ONLY REASON I CANNOT PROVE THAT I AM RIGHT IS THAT I CAN'T
STUDY AN ISOLATED BRAIN NEURON IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL."

 

  "HAVE YOU TRIED TO STUDY THEM? IF YOU WORK WITH A LIVING HUMAN BRAIN,
DON'T YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN TO SEVERE LAWSUITS OR TO CRIMINAL TRIAL?"

 

  "OF COURSE. I'M NOT MAD. I'VE WORKED WITH ANIMALS. I HAVE TO."

 

  "YOU TOLD ME ALL THIS TWO YEARS AGO. I TAKE IT, THEN, YOU HAVE MADE NO
STARTLING DISCOVERIES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS."

 

  "NONE. BUT I'M CONVINCED I'M RIGHT JUST THE SAME."

 

  "YOUR BEING CONVINCED DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ANYONE
ELSE. BUT NOW I HAVE TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION. HAVE YOU DONE
SOMETHING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT HAS MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE
SOVIETS?"

 

  "THE SOVIETS?"

 

  "YES. WHAT IS THIS ATTITUDE OF SURPRISE, DR. MORRISON? HAVEN'T YOU
SPENT AN HOUR OR TWO IN CONVERSATION WITH DR. BORANOVA? ISN'T SHE THE
ONE WHOM YOU JUST LEFT IN A GREAT HURRY?"

 

  "DR. BORANOVA?" MORRISON, IN HIS CONFUSION, COULD THINK OF NOTHING
BETTER TO DO THAN PLAY THE PARROT.

 

  RODANO'S FACE LOST NONE OF ITS PLEASANTNESS. "EXACTLY. WE KNOW HER
WELL. WE KEEP HALF AN EYE ON HER WHENEVER SHE IS IN THE UNITED STATES."

 

  "YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THE BAD OLD DAYS," MUMBLED MORRISON.

 

  RODANO SHRUGGED. "NO, NOT AT ALL. THERE IS NO DANGER OF NUCLEAR WAR
NOW. WE ARE POLITE TO EACH OTHER, THE SOVIET UNION AND WE. WE COOPERATE
IN SPACE. WE HAVE A COOPERATIVE MINING STATION ON THE MOON AND FREEDOM
OF ENTRY INTO EACH OTHER'S SPACE SETTLEMENTS. THAT MAKES THESE THE GOOD
NEW DAYS. BUT, DOCTOR, SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE ENTIRELY. WE KEEP AN EYE
ON OUR POLITE COMPANIONS, THE SOVIETS, JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY
VIRTUOUS. WHY NOT? THEY KEEP AN EYE ON US."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU KEEP AN EYE ON ME, TOO, IT WOULD SEEM."

 

  "BUT YOU WERE WITH DR. BORANOVA. WE COULDN'T HELP SEEING YOU."

 

  "THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, I ASSURE YOU. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF EVER
BEING IN HER VICINITY AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT. SHE'S A MADWOMAN."

 

  "DO YOU MEAN THAT LITERALLY?"

 

  "TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. -- LOOK, NOTHING OF WHAT SHE AND I TALKED ABOUT
IS SECRET AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. WHAT SHE SAID I FEEL FREE TO REPEAT.
SHE'S INVOLVED IN SOME MINIATURIZATION PROJECT."

 

  "WE'VE HEARD OF IT," SAID RODANO EASILY. "THEY HAVE A SPECIAL TOWN IN
THE URALS DEVOTED TO MINIATURIZATION EXPERIMENTS."

 

  "ARE THEY GETTING ANYWHERE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW?"

 

  "WE WONDER."

 

  "SHE'S TRIED TO TELL ME THEY ARE, THAT THEY'VE SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING
ACTUAL MINIATURIZATION."

 

  RODANO SAID NOTHING.

 

  MORRISON, WHO HAD WAITED A MOMENT TO LET HIM SPEAK, THEN SAID, "BUT
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, I TELL YOU. SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. YOU MUST
REALIZE THAT, OR, SINCE YOUR FIELD OF EXPERTISE IS SLAVIC LANGUAGES AND
ECONOMICS, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. "

 

  "I DON'T HAVE TO, MY FRIEND. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO SAY IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE AND YET, NEVERTHELESS, WE WONDER. THE SOVIETS ARE FREE TO
PLAY WITH MINIATURIZATION IF THEY PLEASE, BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT
THEM TO HAVE IT UNLESS WE DO ALSO. AFTER ALL, WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT USES
IT MIGHT BE PUT."

 

  "TO NONE! TO NONE!" SAID MORRISON FIERCELY. "THERE'S NO POINT IN
WORRYING ABOUT IT. IF OUR GOVERNMENT REALLY DOESN'T WANT THE SOVIET
UNION TO GET TOO FAR AHEAD IN TECHNOLOGY, IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE THIS
MINIATURIZATION MADNESS. LET THE SOVIETS SPEND MONEY ON IT -- AND TIME
AND MATERIAL -- AND CONCENTRATE EVERY ATOM OF THEIR SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE
ON IT. EVERYTHING WILL BE WASTED."

 

  "AND YET," SAID RODANO. "I DON'T THINK DR. BORANOVA IS MAD OR A FOOL,
ANY MORE THAN I THINK THAT YOU ARE MAD OR A FOOL. -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I
WAS THINKING AS I WATCHED THE TWO OF YOU IN SO INTENT A CONVERSATION ON
THE PARK BENCH? IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE WANTED YOUR HELP. PERHAPS SHE
THOUGHT THAT WITH YOUR THEORIES ON NEUROPHYSICS YOU COULD SOMEHOW HELP
THE SOVIET PUSH FOR MINIATURIZATION. THEIR PECULIAR THEORIES AND YOUR
PECULIAR THEORIES MIGHT ADD UP TO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AT ALL PECULIAR.
OR SO I THINK."

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TIGHTENED. "I TOLD YOU I HAVE NO SECRETS TO KEEP, SO
I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE RIGHT. JUST AS YOU SAY, SHE WANTS ME TO GO
TO THE SOVIET UNION AND HELP OUT IN THEIR MINIATURIZATION PROJECT. I
WON'T ASK HOW YOU KNOW THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST AN IDLE GUESS
AND DON'T TRY TO PERSUADE ME IT IS."

 

  RODANO SMILED AND MORRISON WENT ON. "IN ANY CASE, I SAID NO. I REFUSED
ABSOLUTELY. I STOOD UP AND LEFT AT ONCE -- AND IN A HURRY. YOU SAW ME
HURRY. THAT'S THE TRUTH. I WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME
TIME TO DO SO. AND I'M REPORTING IT NOW, AS A MATTER OF FACT, TO YOU.
NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR YOU NOT TO BELIEVE ME BECAUSE WHY, UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD I TAKE ANY PART IN A PROJECT THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO
SENSE TO IT. EVEN IF I WANTED TO WORK AGAINST MY COUNTRY, WHICH I DON'T,
I'M ENOUGH OF A PHYSICIST NOT TO TRY TO DO SO BY INVOLVING MYSELF IN
ANYTHING AS INSANE AS WORKING ON A PROJECT WITHOUT HOPE. THEY MIGHT AS
WELL BE WORKING ON A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE, OR ANTIGRAVITY, OR
FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL, OR --" HE WAS PERSPIRING FREELY.

 

  AND RODANO SAID GENTLY, "PLEASE, DR. MORRISON, NO ONE DOUBTS YOUR
LOYALTY. CERTAINLY I DON'T. I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE I AM PERTURBED AT YOUR
HAVING HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE RUSSIAN WOMAN. I AM HERE BECAUSE WE HAD
REASON TO THINK SHE MIGHT APPROACH YOU AND WE FEARED YOU WOULD NOT
LISTEN TO HER."

 

  "WHAT?"

 

  "NOW UNDERSTAND ME, DR. MORRISON. PLEASE UNDERSTAND. WE WOULD SUGGEST
-- IN FACT, WE WOULD VERY MUCH WANT -- TO HAVE YOU GO WITH DR. BORANOVA
TO THE SOVIET UNION."

 

  5.

 

  MORRISON STARED AT RODANO, FACE PALE, LOWER LIP QUIVERING SLIGHTLY. HE
BRUSHED AT HIS HAIR WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND SAID, "WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO
GO TO THE SOVIET UNION?"

 

  "NOT I, PERSONALLY. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WANTS IT."

 

  "WHY?"

 

  "FOR THE OBVIOUS REASON. IF THE SOVIET UNION IS ENGAGED IN
MINIATURIZATION EXPERIMENTS, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS
POSSIBLE."

 

  "YOU'VE GOT MADAME BORANOVA. SHE MUST KNOW A GREAT DEAL. GRAB HER AND
BEAT IT OUT OF HER."

 

  RODANO SIGHED AND SAID, "I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING. WE CAN'T DO THAT THESE
DAYS. YOU KNOW THAT. THE SOVIET UNION WOULD RETALIATE AT ONCE IN THE
MOST UNPLEASANT WAYS AND WORLD OPINION WOULD BE WITH THEM. SO LET'S NOT
WASTE TIME WITH JOKES LIKE THAT."

 

  "ALL RIGHT. GRANTED, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING CRUDE. I PRESUME WE HAVE
AGENTS ATTEMPTING TO DIG OUT THE DETAILS."

 

  "THE OPERATIVE WORD, DOCTOR, IS ATTEMPTING. WE HAVE OUR AGENTS IN THE
SOVIET UNION, TO SAY NOTHING OF SOPHISTICATED ESPIONAGE EQUIPMENT BOTH
EARTHSIDE AND IN SPACE, JUST AS THEY HAVE AGENTS HERE. BUT IF THEY AND
WE ARE VERY GOOD AT POKING AROUND QUIETLY, WE'RE ALSO VERY GOOD AT
KEEPING THINGS SECRET. IF ANYTHING, THE SOVIET UNION IS BETTER AT IT
THAN WE ARE. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE NOT WHAT YOU CALL THE BAD OLD DAYS,
THE SOVIET UNION IS STILL NOT QUITE AN OPEN SOCIETY IN OUR SENSE AND
THEY'VE HAD MORE THAN A CENTURY OF PRACTICE IN KEEPING THINGS UNDER THE
RUG."

 

  "THEN WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?"

 

  "YOU'RE DIFFERENT. THE USUAL AGENT IS SENT INTO THE SOVIET UNION OR
INTO SOME REGION IN WHICH THE SOVIET UNION IS OPERATING UNDER SOME COVER
WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY BE PENETRATED. HE -- OR SHE -- MUST INSINUATE
HIMSELF INTO A PLACE WHERE HE IS NOT REALLY WELCOME AND MANAGE TO ELICIT
INFORMATION THAT IS SECRET. THIS ISN'T EASY. HE -- OR SHE -- USUALLY
DOES NOT SUCCEED AND HE -- OR SHE -- IS SOMETIMES CAUGHT, WHICH IS
ALWAYS UNPLEASANT ALL AROUND. IN YOUR CASE, THOUGH, THEY'RE ASKING FOR
YOU; THEY BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY NEED YOU. THEY WILL PLACE YOU IN THE
VERY MIDST OF THEIR SECRET INSTALLATIONS. WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WILL
HAVE."

 

  "BUT THEY'VE JUST ASKED ME TO GO IN THESE LAST TWO HOURS. HOW DO YOU
KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT?"

 

  "THEY'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN YOU FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. ONE OF THE
REASONS I MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO TALK TO YOU TWO YEARS AGO WAS BECAUSE
THEY SEEMED INTERESTED IN YOU EVEN AT THAT TIME AND WE WERE WONDERING
WHY THAT SHOULD BE. SO WHEN THEY MADE THEIR MOVE, WE WERE READY."

 

  MORRISON'S FINGERS DRUMMED ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR, HIS NAILS MAKING A
RHYTHMIC CLICKING NOISE. "LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I'M TO AGREE TO GO
WITH NATALYA BORANOVA TO THE SOVIET UNION, PRESUMABLY TO THE REGION
WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSEDLY WORKING ON MINIATURIZATION. I AM TO PRETEND TO
HELP THEM --"

 

  "YOU NEEDN'T PRETEND," SAID RODANO COMFORTABLY. "HELP THEM IF YOU CAN,
ESPECIALLY IF THAT MEANS YOU GET TO KNOW THE PROCESS BETTER."

 

  "ALL RIGHT, HELP THEM. AND THEN GIVE YOU WHAT INFORMATION I HAVE WHEN
I RETURN."

 

  "EXACTLY."

 

  "WHAT IF THERE IS NO INFORMATION? WHAT IF THE WHOLE THING IS ONE
GIGANTIC BLUFF OR IF THEY'RE ONLY KIDDING THEMSELVES? WHAT IF THEY'RE
FOLLOWING SOME LYSENKO TYPE DOWN INTO AN EMPTY HOLE?"

 

  "THEN TELL US THAT. WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT -- IF IT'S A MATTER OF
KNOWING AND NOT JUST THINKING. AFTER ALL, THE SOVIETS, WE ARE PRETTY
CERTAIN, ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON THE
MATTER OF ANTIGRAVITY. MAYBE WE ARE AND MAYBE WE'RE NOT. THEY DON'T KNOW
FOR CERTAIN AND WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO LET THEM FIND OUT. SINCE WE'RE NOT
ASKING ANY SOVIET SCIENTIST TO COME AND HELP US, WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM
AN EASY ENTRY. FOR THAT MATTER, THERE'S SOME TALK THE CHINESE ARE
WORKING ON FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL. ODDLY ENOUGH, THOSE ARE TWO ITEMS
YOU MENTIONED AS BEING THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT
ANYONE'S WORKING ON PERPETUAL MOTION, HOWEVER."

 

  "THESE ARE RIDICULOUS GAMES THE NATIONS ARE PLAYING," SAID MORRISON.
"WHY DON'T THEY COOPERATE IN THESE MATTERS? WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE
BAD OLD DAYS."

 

  "NOT QUITE. BUT BEING IN THE GOOD NEW DAYS DOES NOT MEAN WE'RE IN
HEAVEN. THERE IS STILL RESIDUAL SUSPICION AND THERE ARE STILL ATTEMPTS
TO TAKE A GIANT STEP FORWARD BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES. MAYBE IT'S EVEN A
GOOD THING. IF WE'RE DRIVEN BY SELFISH MOTIVES OF AGGRANDIZEMENT, AS
LONG AS THAT DOESN'T LEAD TO WAR, WE MAY MAKE MORE RAPID PROGRESS. TO
STOP TRYING TO STEAL A MARCH ON NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS MIGHT REDUCE US TO
INDOLENCE AND DECAY."

 

  "SO IF I GO AND AM EVENTUALLY IN A POSITION TO ASSURE YOU,
AUTHORITATIVELY, THAT THE SOVIETS ARE DRILLING A DRY HOLE OR THAT THEY
ARE INDEED MAKING PROGRESS OF SUCH AND SUCH A NATURE, THEN I WILL BE
HELPING NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD, TO REMAIN
VIGOROUS AND PROGRESSIVEEVEN INCLUDING THE SOVIET UNION."

 

  RODANO NODDED. "THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I HAVE TO GIVE YOU PEOPLE CREDIT. YOU'RE CLEVER CON
ARTISTS. HOWEVER, I DON'T FALL FOR IT. I FAVOR COOPERATION AMONG NATIONS
AND I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THESE DANGEROUS TWENTIETH-CENTURY GAMES IN THE
RATIONAL TWENTY-FIRST. I TOLD DR. BORANOVA I WASN'T GOING AND I'M
TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING."

 

  "DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT IS ASKING THIS OF
YOU."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE ASKING ME AND I'M REFUSING YOU. BUT IF IT
HAPPENS THAT YOU ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEWS IN THIS, THEN
I AM PREPARED TO REFUSE THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL."

 

  6.

 

  MORRISON SAT THERE, FLUSHED, CHIN UP. HIS HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY
AND HE FELT HEROIC.

 

  NOTHING CAN MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND, HE THOUGHT. WHAT CAN THEY DO?
THROW ME IN JAIL? WHAT FOR? THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CHARGE.

 

  HE WAITED FOR ANGER FROM THE OTHER. FOR A THREAT.

 

  RODANO MERELY LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF QUIET BEMUSEMENT.

 

  "WHY DO YOU REFUSE, DR. MORRISON?" HE ASKED. "HAVE YOU NO FEELINGS OF
PATRIOTISM?"

 

  "PATRIOTISM, YES. INSANITY, NO."

 

  "WHY INSANITY?"

 

  "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO WITH ME?"

 

  "TELL ME."

 

  "THEY INTEND TO MINIATURIZE ME AND PLACE ME IN A HUMAN BODY TO
INVESTIGATE THE NEUROPHYSICAL STATE OF A BRAIN CELL FROM THE INSIDE."

 

  "WHY SHOULD THEY WANT YOU TO DO THAT?"

 

  "THEY IMPLY IT'S TO HELP ME WITH MY RESEARCH, WHICH THEY CLAIM WILL
ALSO HELP THEM, BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T INTEND TO SUBMIT TO SUCH AN
EXPERIMENT."

 

  RODANO SCRATCHED LIGHTLY AT HIS FLUFFY HAIR, PUT IT INTO A MILD
DISARRAY, AND QUICKLY FLATTENED IT AGAIN AS THOUGH ANXIOUS NOT TO SHOW
TOO MUCH PINK SKIN.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE CONCERNED OVER THIS. YOU TELL ME THAT
MINIATURIZATION IS FLATLY IMPOSSIBLE -- IN WHICH CASE, THEY CAN'T
MINIATURIZE YOU WHATEVER THEIR INTENTIONS OR DESIRES."

 

  "THEY'LL PERFORM SOME SORT OF EXPERIMENT ON ME. THEY SAY THEY HAVE
MINIATURIZATION, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE EITHER LIARS OR MAD, AND IN EITHER
CASE I WON'T HAVE THEM PLAYING GAMES WITH ME -- EITHER TO DO THEM
PLEASURE, OR TO DO YOU PLEASURE, OR TO DO THE WHOLE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
PLEASURE."

 

  "THEY'RE NOT MAD," SAID RODANO, "AND WHATEVER THEIR INTENTIONS, THEY
KNOW VERY WELL WE'D HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELL-BEING OF AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN INVITED BY THEM TO THEIR COUNTRY."

 

  "THANK YOU! THANK YOU! HOW WOULD YOU HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE? SEND THEM
A STIFF NOTE? HOLD ONE OF THEIR CITIZENS IN REPRISAL? BESIDES, WHO SAYS
THEY'LL EXECUTE ME PUBLICLY IN RED SQUARE? WHAT IF THEY DECIDE THEY
DON'T WANT ME TO RETURN AND TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK ON MINIATURIZATION?
THEY'LL HAVE WHAT THEY WANT OF ME -- WHATEVER THAT MAY BE -- AND THEY'LL
DECIDE THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT NEED NOT BENEFIT IN THEIR TURN FROM
ANY KNOWLEDGE I MAY HAVE GAINED FROM THEM. SO THEY ARRANGE A SMALL
ACCIDENT. SO SORRY! SO SORRY! AND THEY, OF COURSE, WILL PAY REPARATIONS
TO MY SORROWING FAMILY AND SEND BACK A FLAG-DRAPED COFFIN. NO, THANK
YOU. I'M NOT THE TYPE FOR A SUICIDE MISSION."

 

  RODANO SAID, "YOU DRAMATIZE. YOU'LL BE A GUEST. YOU WILL HELP THEM IF
YOU CAN AND YOU NEEDN'T BE OSTENTATIOUS ABOUT LEARNING THINGS. WE'RE NOT
ASKING YOU TO BE A SPY; WE WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR ANYTHING YOU MAY PICK UP
MORE OR LESS UNAVOIDABLY. WHAT'S MORE, WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE THERE WHO
WILL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU IF THEY CAN. WE INTEND TO SEE TO IT THAT YOU GET
BACK SAFELY --"

 

  "IF YOU CAN," INTERPOSED MORRISON.

 

  "IF WE CAN," AGREED RODANO. "WE CAN'T PROMISE YOU MIRACLES. WOULD YOU
BELIEVE US IF WE DID?"

 

  "DO WHAT YOU WILL, THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR ME. I'M NOT THAT COURAGEOUS.
I'M NOT PLANNING TO BECOME A PAWN IN SOME CRAZY CHESS GAME, WITH MY LIFE
VERY POSSIBLY AT STAKE, JUST BECAUSE YOU -- OR THE GOVERNMENT -- ASK ME
TO."

 

  "YOU FRIGHTEN YOURSELF UNNECESSARILY."

 

  "NOT SO. FRIGHT HAS ITS PROPER ROLE; IT KEEPS ONE CAUTIOUS AND ALIVE.
THERE'S A TRICK TO STAYING ALIVE WHEN YOU'RE SOMEONE LIKE ME; IT'S
CALLED COWARDICE. IT MAY NOT BE ADMIRABLE TO BE A COWARD IF SOMEONE HAS
THE MUSCLES AND MIND OF AN OX, BUT IT'S NO CRIME FOR A WEAKLING TO BE
ONE. I AM NOT SO GREAT A COWARD, HOWEVER, THAT I CAN BE FORCED TO TAKE
ON A SUICIDE ROLE, SIMPLY BECAUSE I FEAR REVEALING MY WEAKNESS. I REVEAL
IT GLADLY. I AM NOT BRAVE ENOUGH FOR THE ROLE. NOW, PLEASE LEAVE."

 

  RODANO SIGHED, HALF-SHRUGGED, HALF-SMILED, AND ROSE SLOWLY TO HIS
FEET. "THAT'S IT, THEN. WE CAN'T FORCE YOU TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY IF YOU
DON'T WISH TO."

 

  HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR, HIS FEET DRAGGING A LITTLE, AND THEN, EVEN
WITH HIS HAND REACHING FOR THE DOORKNOB, HE TURNED AND SAID, "STILL, IT
UPSETS ME A LITTLE. I'M AFRAID I WAS WRONG AND I HATE TO BE WRONG."

 

  "WRONG? WHAT DID YOU DO? BET SOMEONE FIVE BUCKS I'D JUMP AT THE CHANCE
TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR MY COUNTRY?"

 

  "NO, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO ADVANCE YOUR CAREER.
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE AS THINGS ARE. YOUR IDEAS ARE NOT
LISTENED TO; YOUR PAPERS ARE NO LONGER PUBLISHED. YOUR APPOINTMENT AT
YOUR UNIVERSITY IS NOT LIKELY TO BE RENEWED. TENURE? FORGET IT.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS? NEVER. NOT AFTER YOU HAVE REFUSED OUR REQUEST. AFTER
THIS YEAR, YOU WILL HAVE NO INCOME AND NO STATUS. AND YET YOU WILL NOT
GO TO THE SOVIET UNION, AS I WAS SURE YOU WOULD AS THE ONE WAY OF
SALVAGING YOUR CAREER. FAILING THAT, WHAT WILL YOU DO?"

 

  "MY PROBLEM."

 

  "NO. OUR PROBLEM. THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THIS GOOD NEW WORLD OF OURS
IS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE: THE PRESTIGE, THE INFLUENCE, THE ABILITIES
THAT COME WITH BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT OTHER POWERS CANNOT. THE GAME IS
BETWEEN THE TWO CHIEF CONTESTANTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ALLIES; WE AND
THEY, THE U.S. AND THE S.U. FOR ALL OUR CIRCUMSPECT FRIENDSHIP, WE STILL
COMPETE. THE COUNTERS IN THE GAME ARE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS AND ANY
DISGRUNTLED COUNTER MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE USED BY THE OTHER SIDE. YOU ARE
A DISGRUNTLED COUNTER, DR. MORRISON. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?"

 

  "I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE OFFENSIVE."

 

  "WE HAVE YOUR STATEMENT THAT DR. BORANOVA INVITED YOU TO VISIT THE
SOVIET UNION. DID SHE, REALLY? MAY SHE NOT HAVE INVITED YOU TO STAY IN
THE UNITED STATES AND WORK FOR THE SOVIET UNION IN RETURN FOR SUPPORT
FOR YOUR IDEAS?"

 

  "I WAS RIGHT. YOU ARE OFFENSIVE."

 

  "IT'S MY JOB TO BE SO -- IF I MUST. WHAT IF I'M RIGHT AFTER ALL AND
YOU WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE OF ADVANCING YOUR CAREER. ONLY THIS IS THE
WAY YOU INTEND TO DO IT -- STAY HERE AND ACCEPT SOVIET MONEY OR BACKING
IN RETURN FOR GIVING THEM WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU CAN."

 

  "THAT IS WRONG. YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT AND YOU CANNOT
PROVE IT."

 

  "BUT I CAN SUSPECT IT AND SO CAN OTHERS. WE WILL THEN MAKE IT OUR
BUSINESS TO KEEP YOU UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO DO SCIENCE. YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE WILL BE OVER -- ENTIRELY. -- AND
YOU CAN AVOID ALL THAT, SIMPLY BY DOING AS WE ASK AND GOING TO THE
SOVIET UNION."

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TIGHTENED AND HE SAID, OUT OF A DRY THROAT, "YOU'RE
THREATENING ME IN A CRUDE ATTEMPT AT BLACKMAIL AND I WON'T CAPITULATE.
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. MY THEORIES ON THE BRAIN'S THINKING CENTER ARE
CORRECT AND THAT WILL SOMEDAY BE RECOGNIZED -- WHATEVER YOU OR ANYONE
DOES."

 

  "YOU CAN'T LIVE ON 'SOMEDAY.'"

 

  "THEN I'LL DIE. I MAY BE A PHYSICAL COWARD, BUT I'M NOT A MORAL ONE.
GOOD-BYE."

 

  RODANO, WITH ONE LAST LOOK, HALF-COMMISERATING, LEFT.

 

  AND MORRISON, SHAKING IN A SPASM OF FEAR AND HOPELESSNESS, FELT THE
SPIRIT OF DEFIANCE LEAK AWAY, LEAVING NOTHING BEHIND BUT DESPAIR.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 2 -- TAKEN

 

  IF ASKING POLITELY IS USELESS, TAKE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  7.

 

  THEN I'LL DIE, THOUGHT MORRISON.

 

  HE HADN'T EVEN BOTHERED DOUBLE-LOCKING THE DOOR AFTER RODANO LEFT. HE
SAT IN THE CHAIR, LOST IN THOUGHT, FACE VACANT. THE WESTERING SUN
SLANTED IN THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO PUSH THE CONTACT
THAT WOULD OPACIFY THE GLASS. HE SIMPLY LET IT SLANT IN. IN FACT, HE
FOUND A DISTANT HYPNOTIC FASCINATION IN WATCHING THE DUST MOTES DANCE.

 

  HE HAD FLED FROM THE RUSSIAN WOMAN IN FRIGHT, BUT HE HAD STOOD UP TO
THE AMERICAN AGENT, STOOD UP WITH THE COURAGE OF -- OF DESPAIR.

 

  AND DESPERATION -- MINUS THE COURAGE -- WAS ALL HE FELT NOW. WHAT
RODANO HAD SAID WAS, AFTER ALL, TRUE. HIS APPOINTMENT WOULD NOT BE
RENEWED FOR THE COMING YEAR AND NONE OF THE FEELERS HE HAD SENT OUT HAD
TWITCHED. HE WAS POISON AT THE ACADEMIC BOX OFFICE AND HE LACKED THE
KIND OF EXPERIENCE (OR, MORE IMPORTANT, THE KIND OF CONTACTS) THAT WOULD
GET HIM A JOB IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, EVEN IF THE QUIET COUNTERVAILING
EFFORT OF AN OFFENDED GOVERNMENT WERE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

 

  WHAT WOULD HE DO? GO TO CANADA?

 

  THERE WAS JANVIER AT MCGILL UNIVERSITY. HE HAD ONCE EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN MORRISON'S IDEAS. ONCE! MORRISON HAD NOT TRIED MCGILL, SINCE
HE HADN'T PLANNED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. NOW HIS PLANS WERE OF NO
ACCOUNT. HE MIGHT HAVE TO.

 

  THERE WAS LATIN AMERICA, WHERE A DOZEN UNIVERSITIES MIGHT WELCOME A
NORTHERNER WHO COULD SPEAK SPANISH OR PORTUGUESE -- AT LEAST AFTER A
FASHION. MORRISON'S SPANISH WAS POOR; HIS PORTUGUESE WAS NIL.

 

  WHAT HAD HE TO LOSE? THERE WERE NO FAMILY TIES. EVEN HIS DAUGHTERS
WERE DISTANT NOW, FADING AT THE EDGES, SOMEHOW, LIKE OLD PHOTOGRAPHS. HE
HAD NO FRIENDS TO SPEAK OF -- AT LEAST NONE THAT HAD SURVIVED THE
DISASTERS OF HIS RESEARCH.

 

  THERE WAS HIS PROGRAM, OF COURSE, SPECIALLY DESIGNED BY HIMSELF. IT
HAD BEEN BUILT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, BY A SMALL FIRM ACCORDING TO HIS
SPECIFICATIONS. SINCE THEN HE HAD MODIFIED IT ENDLESSLY ON HIS OWN.
PERHAPS HE SHOULD PATENT IT, EXCEPT THAT NO ONE BUT HE WAS EVER LIKELY
TO USE IT. HE WOULD TAKE IT WITH HIM, OF COURSE, WHEREVER HE WENT. HE
HAD IT WITH HIM NOW, IN HIS LEFT INNER JACKET POCKET, WITHIN WHICH IT
BULGED LIKE AN OVERSIZE WALLET.

 

  MORRISON COULD HEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF HIS OWN BREATHING AND HE REALIZED
THAT HE WAS ESCAPING FROM THE PURPOSELESS MERRY-GO-ROUND OF HIS THOUGHTS
BY FALLING ASLEEP OVER THEM. HOW COULD HE INTEREST OTHERS IN ANYTHING,
HE THOUGHT BITTERLY, WHEN HE BORED EVEN HIMSELF?

 

  HE WAS AWARE THAT THE SUN NO LONGER STRUCK HIS WINDOW AND THAT A
GATHERING TWILIGHT ENCOMPASSED HIS ROOM. SO MUCH THE BETTER.

 

  HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A POLITE BUZZ. IT WAS THE ROOM TELEPHONE, HE
REALIZED, BUT HE DIDN'T BUDGE. MORRISON LET HIS EYES REMAIN CLOSED. IT
WAS PROBABLY THIS MAN, THIS RODANO, CALLING TO MAKE A FINAL TRY. LET HIM
RING.

 

  SLEEP CLOSED IN AND MORRISON'S HEAD LOLLED TO ONE SIDE IN SO
UNCOMFORTABLE A POSITION THAT HE DIDN'T STAY ASLEEP LONG.

 

  IT WAS PERHAPS FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THAT HE STARTED AWAKE. THE SKY
WAS STILL BLUE, BUT THE TWILIGHT IN HIS ROOM HAD DARKENED AND HE
THOUGHT, WITH SOME GUILT, THAT HE HAD MISSED ALL THE PAPERS GIVEN IN THE
AFTERNOON. AND THEN, REBELLIOUSLY, HE THOUGHT: GOOD! WHY SHOULD I WANT
TO HEAR THEM?

 

  REBELLION GREW. WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THE CONVENTION ANYWAY? IN THREE
DAYS HE HAD NOT HEARD ONE PAPER THAT HAD INTERESTED HIM, NOR HAD HE MET
ANYONE WHO COULD DO HIS SINKING CAREER ONE BIT OF GOOD. WHAT WOULD HE DO
THE REMAINING THREE DAYS EXCEPT TRY TO AVOID THE TWO PEOPLE HE HAD MET
WHOM HE DESPERATELY DID NOT WANT TO MEET AGAIN -- BORANOVA AND RODANO.

 

  HE WAS HUNGRY. HE HADN'T HAD A PROPER LUNCH AND IT WAS ALMOST
DINNERTIME. THE TROUBLE WAS THAT HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO EAT ALONE IN THE
HOTEL'S PLUSH RESTAURANT AND IN LESS OF A MOOD TO PAY ITS INFLATED
PRICES. THE THOUGHT OF WAITING IN LINE FOR A STOOL AT THE COFFEE SHOP
WAS EVEN LESS APPETIZING.

 

  THAT DECIDED EVERYTHING. HE'D HAD ENOUGH. HE MIGHT AS WELL CHECK OUT
AND WALK TO THE TRAIN STATION. (IT WAS NOT A LONG WALK AND THE COOL
EVENING AIR WOULD, PERHAPS, HELP CLEAR THE MISERIES OUT OF HIS MIND.) IT
WOULD TAKE HIM LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES TO PACK; HE'D BE ON HIS WAY
IN TEN.

 

  HE WENT ABOUT THE, TASK GRIMLY. AT LEAST HE WOULD SAVE HALF THE HOTEL
BILL AND HE WOULD GET AWAY FROM A PLACE THAT, HE WAS CONVINCED, WOULD
BRING HIM ONLY MISERY IF HE STAYED.

 

  HE WAS QUITE RIGHT, OF COURSE, BUT NO PRESCIENT BELL IN HIS MIND RANG
TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD ALREADY STAYED TOO LONG.

 

  8.

 

  AFTER QUICKLY CHECKING OUT AT THE DESK DOWNSTAIRS, MORRISON STEPPED
OUT OF THE LARGE GLASS DOORS OF THE HOTEL, GLAD TO BE FREE, BUT STILL
ILL AT EASE. HE HAD CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED THE LOBBY TO MAKE SURE THAT
NEITHER BORANOVA NOR RODANO WAS IN SIGHT AND NOW HE LOOKED UP AND DOWN
THE LINE OF TAXIS AND STUDIED THE KNOTS OF PEOPLE MOVING IN AND OUT OF
THE HOTEL.

 

  ALL CLEAR -- IT SEEMED.

 

  ALL CLEAR, EXCEPT FOR AN ANGRY GOVERNMENT, NOTHING ACCOMPLISHED, AND
ENDLESS TROUBLE AHEAD. MCGILL UNIVERSITY SEEMED MORE ATTRACTIVE EVERY
MOMENT -- IF HE COULD GET IN.

 

  HE SWUNG DOWN THE SIDEWALK IN THE DARKENING EVENING TOWARD THE TRAIN
STATION, WHICH WAS JUST TOO FAR AWAY TO BE IN SIGHT. HE WOULD GET HOME,
HE CALCULATED, WELL PAST MIDNIGHT AND HE WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL OF
SLEEPING ON THE TRAIN. HE HAD A BOOK OF CROSSWORD PUZZLES THAT MIGHT
OCCUPY HIM -- IF THE LIGHT WERE GOOD ENOUGH. OR --

 

  MORRISON WHEELED AROUND AT THE SOUND OF HIS NAME. HE DID THIS
AUTOMATICALLY, THOUGH BY RIGHTS, UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT PREVAILED, HE
SHOULD HAVE HURRIED ONWARD. THERE WAS NO ONE HERE HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO.

 

  "AL! AL MORRISON! GOOD HEAVENS!" THE VOICE WAS HIGH-PITCHED AND
MORRISON DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT.

 

  NOR DID HE RECOGNIZE THE FACE. IT WAS ROUND, MIDDLE-AGED,
SMOOTH-SHAVEN, AND DECORATED WITH STEEL-FRAMED GLASSES. THE PERSON IT
BELONGED TO WAS WELLDRESSED.

 

  MORRISON AT ONCE FELT THE USUAL AGONY OF TRYING TO REMEMBER A PERSON
WHO CLEARLY REMEMBERED HIM AND WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WERE GOOD
FRIENDS. HIS MOUTH FELL OPEN WITH THE EFFORT OF RIFFLING THROUGH HIS
MIND'S CARD CATALOG.

 

  THE OTHER MAN SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT WAS TROUBLING MORRISON AND IT
DIDN'T SEEM TO BOTHER HIM. HE SAID, "YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME, I SEE. NO
REASON YOU SHOULD. I'M CHARLIE NORBERT. WE MET AT A GORDON RESEARCH
CONFERENCE -- OH, YEARS AGO. YOU WERE QUESTIONING ONE OF THE SPEAKERS ON
BRAIN FUNCTION AND DID A GOOD JOB. VERY INCISIVE. SO IT'S NO WONDER I
REMEMBER YOU, YOU SEE."

 

  "AH YES," MUMBLED MORRISON, TRYING TO REMEMBER WHEN HE HAD LAST BEEN
AT A GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE. ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, WASN'T IT?
"THAT'S VERY FLATTERING OF YOU."

 

  "WE HAD A LONG TALK ABOUT IT THAT EVENING, DR. MORRISON. I REMEMBER
BECAUSE I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY YOU. NO REASON FOR YOU TO REMEMBER,
THOUGH. THERE'S NOTHING IMPRESSIVE ABOUT ME. LISTEN, I CAME ACROSS YOUR
NAME ON THE LIST OF ATTENDEES. YOUR MIDDLE NAME, JONAS, BROUGHT YOU
RIGHT BACK. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. I CALLED YOUR ROOM ABOUT HALF AN
HOUR AGO, BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER."

 

  NORBERT SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF MORRISON'S SUITCASE FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND SAID IN OBVIOUS DISMAY, "ARE YOU LEAVING?"

 

  "ACTUALLY, I'M TRYING TO CATCH A TRAIN. SORRY."

 

  "PLEASE GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES. I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT YOUR --
NOTIONS."

 

  MORRISON STEPPED BACK A LITTLE. EVEN EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HIS IDEAS
WAS NOT ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT. BESIDES, THE OTHER'S AFTER SHAVE LOTION
WAS STRONG AND INVADED HIS PERSONAL SPACE, AS DID THE MAN HIMSELF.
NOTHING THE OTHER SAID BROUGHT BACK ANY MEMORY OF HIM.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I'M SORRY, BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN READING ABOUT MY
NOTIONS, YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, BUT --"

 

  "BUT I DO MIND." NORBERT'S FACE GREW SERIOUS. "IT STRIKES ME THE FIELD
ISN'T PROPERLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOU."

 

  "THAT FACT STRUCK ME A LONG TIME AGO, MR. NORBERT."

 

  "CALL ME CHARLIE. WE WERE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS LONG AGO. -- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO UNAPPRECIATED, YOU KNOW?"

 

  "THERE'S NO COMPULSION ABOUT IT. I JUST AM AND THAT'S IT. WELL --"
MORRISON TURNED AS IF TO LEAVE.

 

  "WAIT, AL. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I COULD GET YOU A NEW JOB WITH PEOPLE
WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING?"

 

  MORRISON PAUSED AGAIN. "I WOULD SAY YOU WERE DREAMING."

 

  "I'M NOT. AL, LISTEN TO ME -- BOY, AM I GLAD I BUMPED INTO YOU -- I
WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEONE. LOOK, WE'RE STARTING A NEW COMPANY,
GENETIC MENTALICS. WE'VE GOT LOTS OF MONEY BEHIND US AND BIG PLANS. THE
TRICK IS TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN MIND BY MEANS OF GENETIC ENGINEERING.
WE'VE BEEN IMPROVING COMPUTERS EVERY YEAR, SO WHY NOT OUR PERSONAL
COMPUTER AS WELL?" HE TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD EARNESTLY. "WHERE IS HE? I
LEFT HIM IN THE CAR WHEN I SAW YOU WALK OUT OF THE HOTEL. YOU KNOW, YOU
HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH IN THE YEARS SINCE I LAST SAW YOU."

 

  MORRISON WAS UNTOUCHED BY THAT. "DOES THIS NEW COMPANY WANT ME?"

 

  "OF COURSE IT WANTS YOU. WE WANT TO CHANGE THE MIND, MAKE IT MORE
INTELLIGENT, MORE CREATIVE. BUT WHAT IS IT WE CHANGE IN ORDER TO
ACCOMPLISH THAT? YOU CAN TELL US."

 

  "I'M AFRAID I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR."

 

  "WE DON'T EXPECT OFFHAND ANSWERS. WE SIMPLY WANT YOU TO WORK TOWARD
IT. -- LISTEN, WHATEVER YOUR SALARY IS NOW, WE'LL DOUBLE IT. YOU JUST
TELL US YOUR PRESENT FIGURE AND WE'LL GO TO THE SMALL TROUBLE OF
MULTIPLYING IT BY TWO. FAIR ENOUGH? AND YOU'LL BE YOUR OWN BOSS."

 

  MORRISON FROWNED. "THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER MET SANTA CLAUS IN
A BUSINESS SUIT. SMOOTH-SHAVEN, TOO. WHAT'S THE GAG?"

 

  "NO GAG. -- WHERE IS HE? -- AH, HE MOVED THE CAR TO GET IT OUT OF THE
LINE OF TRAFFIC. -- LOOK, HE'S MY BOSS, CRAIG LEVINSON. WE'RE NOT DOING
YOU A FAVOR, AL. YOU'LL BE DOING US A FAVOR. COME WITH ME."

 

  MORRISON HESITATED ONLY MOMENTARILY. IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE
DAWN. WHEN YOU'RE DOWN, THERE'S NO DIRECTION BUT UP. LIGHTNING DOES
STRIKE SOMETIMES. -- HE WAS SUDDENLY FULL OF OLD SAWS.

 

  HE LET HIMSELF BE LED BY THE OTHER, HANGING BACK ONLY SLIGHTLY.

 

  NORBERT WAVED AND CALLED OUT, "I FOUND HIM! THIS IS THE FELLOW I TOLD
YOU ABOUT. AL MORRISON. HE'S THE ONE WE NEED."

 

  A GRAVE MIDDLE-AGED FACE LOOKED OUT FROM BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL OF
A LATE-MODEL AUTOMOBILE, WHOSE COLOR WAS SOMETHING UNCERTAIN IN THE
GATHERING DARKNESS. THE FACE SMILED, TEETH GLEAMING WHITELY, AND THE
VOICE THAT BELONGED TO IT SAID, "GREAT!"

 

  THE TRUNK DOOR LIFTED UPWARD AS THEY APPROACHED AND CHARLIE NORBERT
TOOK MORRISON'S SUITCASE. "HERE, LET ME UNLOAD YOU." HE SWUNG IT INTO
THE TRUNK AND CLOSED THE DOOR.

 

  "WAIT," SAID MORRISON, RATHER SURPRISED.

 

  "DON'T WORRY, AL. IF YOU MISS THIS TRAIN, THERE'S ANOTHER. IF YOU
WANT, WE'LL HIRE A LIMOUSINE TO TAKE YOU HOME -- EVENTUALLY. GET IN."

 

  "INTO THE CAR?"

 

  "CERTAINLY." THE BACK DOOR HAD SWUNG OPEN INVITINGLY.

 

  "WHERE WILL WE BE GOING?"

 

  "LOOK," SAID NORBERT, HIS VOICE DROPPING HALF AN OCTAVE AND GETTING
MUCH SOFTER. "LET'S NOT WASTE TIME. GET IN."

 

  MORRISON FELT SOMETHING HARD AGAINST HIS SIDE AND TWISTED IN ORDER TO
SEE WHAT IT WAS.

 

  HE FELT IT -- WHATEVER IT WAS -- PUSH AGAINST HIM. NORBERT'S VOICE WAS
A WHISPER NOW. "LET'S BE VERY QUIET, AL. LET'S NOT MAKE A FUSS."

 

  MORRISON GOT INTO THE CAR AND WAS SUDDENLY VERY FRIGHTENED. HE KNEW
THAT NORBERT WAS HOLDING A GUN.

 

  9.

 

  MORRISON PUSHED HIMSELF ACROSS THE BACK SEAT, WONDERING IF HE COULD
REACH THE OTHER DOOR AND GET OUT AGAIN. EVEN IF NORBERT HAD A GUN, WOULD
HE WANT TO USE IT IN A HOTEL PARKING LOT WITH A HUNDRED PEOPLE WITHIN
THIRTY METERS? AFTER ALL, EVEN IF THE GUN WERE SILENCED, HIS SUDDEN
COLLAPSE WOULD SURELY DRAW ATTENTION.

 

  THE POSSIBILITY VANISHED QUICKLY, HOWEVER, WHEN A THIRD MAN GOT INTO
THE OTHER DOOR, A LARGE ONE WHO GRUNTED AS HE BENT HIMSELF INTO THE CAR
AND WHO LOOKED AT MORRISON, IF NOT MALEVOLENTLY, THEN CERTAINLY WITH AN
EXPRESSION THAT WAS FREE OF ANY TRACE OF FRIENDSHIP.

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF SQUEEZED BETWEEN A MAN ON EITHER SIDE AND WAS
INCAPABLE OF STIRRING. THE CAR MOVED FORWARD SMOOTHLY AND PICKED UP
SPEED ONCE IT MOVED ONTO THE HIGHWAY.

 

  MORRISON SAID IN A CHOKED VOICE, "WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? WHERE ARE WE
GOING? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?"

 

  NORBERT'S VOICE, WITHOUT THE FALSETTO AND WITHOUT THE SYNTHETIC
BONHOMIE, WAS GRIM. "NO NEED TO WORRY, DR. MORRISON. WE HAVE NO
INTENTION OF HARMING YOU. WE JUST WANT YOU WITH US."

 

  "I WAS WITH YOU BACK THERE." (HE TRIED TO POINT "BACK THERE," BUT THE
MAN ON HIS RIGHT LEANED AGAINST HIM AND HE COULD NOT FREE HIS RIGHT HAND
TO DO SO.)

 

  "BUT WE WANT YOU TO BE WITH US -- SOMEWHERE ELSE."

 

  MORRISON TRIED TO SOUND THREATENING. "SEE HERE, YOU'RE KIDNAPPING ME.
THAT'S A SERIOUS OFFENSE."

 

  "NO, DR. MORRISON, LET'S NOT CALL IT KIDNAPPING. LET'S CALL IT BEING
FRIENDLY IN A RATHER FORCIBLE WAY."

 

  "WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, THIS IS ILLEGAL. OR ARE YOU THE POLICE? IF SO,
IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND TELL ME WHAT I'VE DONE AND WHAT THIS IS ALL
ABOUT."

 

  "WE ARE NOT CHARGING YOU WITH ANYTHING. I TOLD YOU. WE JUST WANT YOU
WITH US. I'D ADVISE YOU TO KEEP QUIET, DOCTOR, AND REMAIN CALM. IT WILL
BE BETTER FOR YOU."

 

  "I CAN'T REMAIN CALM IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON."

 

  "FORCE YOURSELF," SAID NORBERT UNSYMPATHETICALLY.

 

  MORRISON COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY THAT WOULD HELP
MATTERS AND, WITHOUT ACTUALLY BECOMING CALM, FELL SILENT.

 

  THE STARS WERE OUT NOW. THE NIGHT WAS AS CLEAR AS THE DAY HAD BEEN.
THE AUTOMOBILE MOVED THROUGH TRAFFIC CONSISTING OF A THOUSAND CARS, EACH
OF WHICH HAD SOMEONE BEHIND THE WHEEL WHO WAS GOING QUIETLY ABOUT HIS OR
HER ORDINARY BUSINESS WITHOUT ANY AWARENESS THAT IN A NEARBY CAR A CRIME
WAS BEING COMMITTED.

 

  MORRISON'S HEART CONTINUED WORKING OVERTIME AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED. HE
COULDN'T HELP BUT BE NERVOUS. THEY SAID THEY MEANT HIM NO HARM, BUT HOW
FAR COULD HE TRUST THEM? SO FAR, EVERYTHING THAT THIS MAN ON HIS LEFT
HAD TOLD HIM HAD BEEN A LIE.

 

  HE TRIED TO BE CALM, BUT TO WHAT ORGAN OF HIS BODY DID HE SPEAK IN
ORDER TO ACHIEVE CALMNESS? HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND FORCED HIMSELF TO
BREATHE DEEPLY AND SLOWLY -- AND TO THINK RATIONALLY. HE WAS A
SCIENTIST. HE HAD TO THINK RATIONALLY.

 

  THESE MUST BE RODANO'S COLLEAGUES. THEY WERE TAKING HIM TO
HEADQUARTERS, WHERE THE PRESSURE TO FORCE HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE MISSION
WOULD BE INCREASED. HOWEVER, THEY COULDN'T SUCCEED. HE WAS AN AMERICAN
AND THAT MEANT HE COULD BE TREATED ONLY ACCORDING TO CERTAIN ESTABLISHED
RULES, CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEDURES, AND CERTAIN CUSTOMARY MODES OF ACTION.
THERE COULD BE NOTHING ARBITRARY, NOTHING IMPROVISED.

 

  HE DREW ANOTHER DEEP BREATH. HE MERELY HAD TO KEEP SAYING NO AND THEY
WOULD BE HELPLESS.

 

  THERE WAS A SMALL LURCH AND HIS EYES FLEW OPEN.

 

  THE CAR HAD TURNED OFF THE HIGHWAY ONTO A NARROW DIRT ROAD.

 

  AUTOMATICALLY, HE SAID, "WHERE ARE WE GOING?"

 

  THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

 

  THE AUTOMOBILE BUMPED ALONG FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND THEN
TURNED INTO A FIELD, OBSCURE AND DARK. IN THE GLOW OF THE CAR'S
HEADLIGHTS, MORRISON MADE OUT A HELICOPTER, ITS ROTORS TURNING SLOWLY
AND ITS MOTOR MAKING ONLY THE SLIGHTEST PURR.

 

  IT WAS ONE OF THE NEW KIND, ITS SOUND WAVES SUPPRESSED, ITS SMOOTH
SURFACE ABSORBING, RATHER THAN REFLECTING, RADAR BEAMS. ITS POPULAR NAME
WAS THE "HUSHICOPTER."

 

  MORRISON'S HEART SANK. IF THEY WERE USING A HUSHICOPTER, WHICH WERE
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND QUITE RARE, THEN HE WAS BEING TREATED AS NO
ORDINARY PREY. HE WAS BEING TREATED AS A BIG FISH.

 

  BUT I'M NOT A BIG FISH, HE THOUGHT DESPERATELY.

 

  THE AUTOMOBILE STOPPED AND THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT. THERE WAS STILL
THE FAINT PURR AND A FEW DIM VIOLET LIGHTS, HARDLY VISIBLE, MARKED THE
SPOT WHERE THE HUSHICOPTER SAT.

 

  THE LARGE MAN AT MORRISON'S RIGHT THREW OPEN THE CAR DOOR AND, AGAIN
WITH A GRUNT, LOWERED HIS HEAD AND FORCED HIS WAY OUT. HIS LARGE HAND
REACHED IN FOR MORRISON.

 

  MORRISON TRIED TO SHRINK AWAY. "WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?"

 

  THE LARGE MAN SEIZED HIS UPPER ARM. "COME OUT. ENOUGH TALKING."

 

  MORRISON FELT HIMSELF HALF-LIFTED, HALF-PULLED OUT OF THE CAR. HIS
SHOULDER HURT AS IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO DO, CONSIDERING THAT IT HAD
BEEN NEARLY YANKED OUT OF ITS SOCKET.

 

  BUT HE DISREGARDED THE PAIN. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD THE
LARGE MAN SPEAK. THE WORDS WERE IN ENGLISH, BUT THE ACCENT WAS THICKLY
RUSSIAN.

 

  MORRISON FELT COLD. THESE WERE NOT AMERICANS WHO HAD HIM.

 

  10.

 

  MORRISON HAD ENTERED THE HUSHICOPTER -- THOUGH THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE. TO ENTER IMPLIES A VOLUNTARY ACTION AND
HE HAD BEEN MUCH MORE NEARLY PUSHED INTO THE VEHICLE.

 

  IT HAD PULSED ITS WAY THROUGH THE DARKNESS AS HE SAT BETWEEN THE SAME
TWO MEN BETWEEN WHOM HE HAD SAT IN THE CAR. IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH
NOTHING HAD CHANGED, ALTHOUGH THE WHISPER OF THE ROTORS WAS DISTINCTLY
MORE HYPNOTIC THAN THE PURR OF THE AUTOMOBILE ENGINE HAD BEEN.

 

  AFTER AN HOUR -- OR POSSIBLY LESS -- THEY CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF
THE AIR AND DRIFTED DOWNWARD TOWARD THE DARKNESS OF THE OCEAN. MORRISON
COULD TELL IT WAS THE OCEAN BECAUSE HE COULD SMELL IT, WAS VAGUELY AWARE
OF THE FOG OF DROPLETS IN THE AIR, AND BECAUSE HE COULD MAKE OUT, VERY
DIMLY, THE DARK BULK OF A SHIP -- DARK ON DARK.

 

  HOW COULD THE HUSHICOPTER MAKE ITS WAY OUT TO THE OCEAN AND PINPOINT A
SHIP? -- THE RIGHT SHIP, HE WAS SURE. EVEN IN HIS HALF-STUPOR OF
DESPAIR, MORRISON'S MIND COULD NOT HELP SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS.
UNDOUBTEDLY, THE HUSHICOPTER PILOT HAD FOLLOWED A SHIELDED AND
PSEUDORANDOMIZED RADIO BEAM. THE BEAM SEEMED RANDOM BUT, GIVEN THE KEY,
IT COULD BE FOUND TO HAVE ORDER AND ITS SOURCE COULD BE IDENTIFIED.
PROPERLY DONE, THE PSEUDORANDOMNESS COULD NOT BE PENETRATED EVEN BY
QUITE AN ADVANCED COMPUTER.

 

  NOR WAS THE SHIP MORE THAN A TEMPORARY STOPPING PLACE. HE WAS ALLOWED
TO USE THE HEAD, GIVEN TIME FOR A HURRIED MEAL OF BREAD AND THICK SOUP
(WHICH HE FOUND MOST WELCOME), AND WAS THEN USHERED -- WITH THE
UNCEREMONIOUS HUSTLE HE HAD BEGUN TO ACCEPT AS A FACT OF LIFE -- INTO A
MEDIUM-SIZED AIRPLANE. IT WAS A TEN-SEATER (HE COUNTED AUTOMATICALLY),
BUT EXCEPT FOR THE TWO PILOTS AND, SITTING IN THE REAR, THE TWO MEN WHO
HAD BEEN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM IN THE CAR AND IN THE HUSHICOPTER, HE WAS
ALONE IN THE PLANE.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED BACK AT HIS GUARDS, WHOM HE JUST MADE OUT IN THE VERY
DIM LIGHT THAT FILLED THE PLANE'S INTERIOR. THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM IN THE
PLANE SO THAT THEY WERE NOT FORCED TO HEM HIM IN. NOR DID THEY NEED TO
DO SO OUT OF FEAR THAT HE MIGHT BREAK AND RUN FOR IT. HERE, HE COULD
BREAK OUT ONLY ONTO THE DECK OF THE SHIP. ONCE THE PLANE TOOK OFF, HE
COULD BREAK OUT ONLY INTO THE OPEN AIR WITH NOTHING BENEATH HIM BUT
WATER OF INDEFINITE DEPTH.

 

  HE WONDERED NUMBLY WHY THEY WERE NOT TAKING OFF AND THEN THE DOOR
OPENED TO ADMIT ANOTHER PASSENGER. DESPITE THE DIMNESS, HE RECOGNIZED
HER AT ONCE.

 

  HE HAD MET HER FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY TWELVE HOURS BEFORE, BUT HOW
COULD HE HAVE PROGRESSED FROM THAT FIRST MOMENT OF MEETING TO THE
PRESENT MOMENT IN ONLY TWELVE HOURS?

 

  BORANOVA SAT DOWN IN THE SEAT NEXT TO HIS AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE, "I
AM SORRY, DR. MORRISON." SHE WAS SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN.

 

  AND, AS THOUGH THAT WERE THE SIGNAL, THE SOUND OF THE AIRPLANE'S
ENGINES DEEPENED AND HE FELT HIMSELF PRESSED AGAINST HIS SEAT AS THE
PLANE MOVED STEEPLY UPWARD.

 

  MORRISON STARED AT NATALYA BORANOVA, TRYING TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS.
DIMLY, HE FELT A DESIRE TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER IN A SUAVE,
IMPERTURBABLE WAY, BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF THAT.

 

  HIS VOICE WAS A CREAK AND EVEN AFTER HE CLEARED HIS THROAT, ALL HE
COULD SAY WAS "I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED."

 

  "THAT COULD NOT BE HELPED, DR. MORRISON. I REGRET THIS. I REALLY DO. I
HAVE MY DUTY, YOU UNDERSTAND. I HAD TO BRING YOU BACK BY PERSUASION IF I
COULD. OTHERWISE --" SHE LET THE LAST WORD HANG.

 

  "BUT YOU CAN'T BEHAVE IN THIS FASHION. THIS IS NOT THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY." HE CHOKED A LITTLE IN HIS EARNEST ATTEMPT TO STIFLE HIS SENSE
OF INDIGNATION TO THE POINT WHERE HE COULD SPEAK SENSIBLY. "I AM NOT A
RECLUSE. I AM NOT A DERELICT. I WILL BE MISSED AND AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE
IS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT WE SPOKE AND THEY KNOW THAT YOU WANTED ME TO
COME TO THE SOVIET UNION. THEY WILL KNOW I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED -- THEY
MAY KNOW IT ALREADY -- AND YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL FIND ITSELF IN THE
MIDDLE OF A KIND OF INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT IT WILL WANT NO PART OF."

 

  "NOT SO," SAID BORANOVA EARNESTLY, HER DARK EYES GAZING LEVELLY INTO
HIS. "NOT SO. OF COURSE YOUR PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED, BUT THEY
HAVE NO OBJECTIONS. DR. MORRISON, THE SOVIET UNION'S INTELLIGENCE
OPERATIONS ARE MARKED BOTH BY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND BY OVER A CENTURY
OF CLOSE STUDY OF AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGY. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT AMERICAN
INTELLIGENCE IS JUST AS ADVANCED. IT IS THIS EQUALITY OF EXPERTISE,
WHICH IS SHARED BY SEVERAL OF THE OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL UNITS OF THE
PLANET, THAT HELPS TO KEEP US IN COOPERATION. EACH OF US IS FIRMLY
CONVINCED THAT NO ONE ELSE IS FAR AHEAD ON A ROAD OF ITS OWN."

 

  "I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT," SAID MORRISON. THE PLANET WAS
ARROWING THROUGH THE NIGHT, SPEEDING TOWARD THE EASTERN DAWN.

 

  "WHAT CONCERNS AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE MOST RIGHT NOW IS OUR ATTEMPT AT
MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "ATTEMPT!" MORRISON SAID WITH A NOTE OF SARDONIC AMUSEMENT.

 

  "SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT. -- THE AMERICANS DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS
SUCCESSFUL. THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE MINIATURIZATION PROJECT MAY NOT BE A
MASK BEHIND WHICH SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT IS GOING ON. THEY KNOW
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING. I'M SURE THEY HAVE A DETAILED MAP OF THE AREA IN
THE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE EXPERIMENTS ARE PROCEEDING -- EVERY BUILDING,
EVERY TRUCK CONVOY. THEY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE AGENTS WHO ARE DOING THEIR
BEST TO PENETRATE THE PROJECT.

 

  "NATURALLY, WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO COUNTER ALL THIS. WE ARE NOT
INDIGNANT. WE KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENTS IN
ANTIGRAVITY AND IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO TAKE THE ATTITUDE THAT WE CAN PROBE
AND THAT THE AMERICANS CAN'T; THAT WE CAN HAVE OUR SUCCESSES, BUT THE
AMERICAN MUSTN'T."

 

  MORRISON RUBBED HIS EYES. BORANOVA'S QUIET, EVEN VOICE WAS MAKING HIM
REALIZE THAT HIS ORDINARY BEDTIME WAS PAST AND THAT HE WAS SLEEPY. HE
SAID, "WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT MY COUNTRY WILL BITTERLY
RESENT MY KIDNAPPING?"

 

  "LISTEN TO ME, DR. MORRISON. UNDERSTAND ME. WHY SHOULD THEY? WE NEED
YOU, BUT THEY CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHY. THEY HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THERE
IS ANYTHING OF VALUE IN YOUR NEUROPHYSICAL NOTIONS. THEY MUST THINK WE
ARE FOLLOWING A FALSE TRAIL AND WILL GET NOTHING OUT OF YOU, BUT THEY
CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION TO GETTING AN AMERICAN INTO THE MINIATURIZATION
PROJECT. IF THIS AMERICAN FINDS OUT WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT, THE
INFORMATION WILL PROVE VALUABLE TO THEM. -- DON'T YOU THINK THEY MIGHT
REASON IN THIS FASHION, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULD REASON," SAID MORRISON CAREFULLY. "IT IS
NOT A MATTER OF INTEREST TO ME."

 

  "BUT YOU SPOKE TO A FRANCIS RODANO AFTER YOU LEFT ME SO SUDDENLY. --
YOU SEE, WE KNOW EVEN THAT. WOULD YOU CARE TO TELL ME THAT HE DID NOT
SUGGEST THAT YOU PLAY ALONG WITH US AND GO TO THE SOVIET UNION IN ORDER
TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND OUT?"

 

  "YOU MEAN HE WANTS ME TO PLAY THE SPY?"

 

  "DOESN'T HE? DIDN'T HE MAKE THAT SUGGESTION?"

 

  AGAIN MORRISON IGNORED THE QUESTION. HE SAID, "AND SINCE YOU ARE
CONVINCED I AM TO BE A SPY, YOU WILL HAVE ME EXECUTED AFTER I DO
WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO. ISN'T THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO SPIES?"

 

  "YOU'VE BEEN VIEWING TOO MANY OLD-FASHIONED MOVIES, DR. MORRISON. IN
THE FIRST PLACE, WE WILL SEE TO IT THAT YOU DON'T FIND OUT ANYTHING
IMPORTANT -- ANYTHING AT ALL. IN THE SECOND PLACE, SPIES ARE TOO
VALUABLE A COMMODITY TO DESTROY. THEY ARE USEFUL AS TRADING UNITS FOR
ANY AGENTS OF OURS THAT MAY BE IN AMERICAN HANDS -- OR IN FOREIGN HANDS
GENERALLY. I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES MUCH THE SAME
ATTITUDE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "TO BEGIN WITH, THEN, I AM NOT A SPY, MADAME. I AM NOT
GOING TO BE A SPY. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE
OPERATIONS. ALSO, I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU."

 

  "I'M NOT AT ALL SURE ABOUT THAT, DR. MORRISON. I THINK YOU'LL DECIDE
TO WORK WITH US."

 

  "WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? WILL YOU STARVE ME TILL I AGREE? BEAT ME?
KEEP ME IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT? PUT ME IN A WORK CAMP?"

 

  BORANOVA FROWNED AND SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE
GENUINE SHOCK. "REALLY, DOCTOR, WHAT ARE THESE THINGS YOU SUGGEST? ARE
WE BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN YOU WERE LOUDLY PROCLAIMING US TO BE AN EVIL
EMPIRE AND INVENTING HORROR STORIES ABOUT US? I DON'T SAY THAT WE MIGHT
NOT BE TEMPTED TO USE STRONG MEASURES IF YOU INTRANSIGEANTLY REFUSE.
NECESSITY DRIVES SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW. -- BUT WE WON'T HAVE TO. I'M
CONVINCED OF THAT."

 

  "WHAT CONVINCES YOU?" MORRISON ASKED WEARILY.

 

  "YOU'RE A SCIENTIST. YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN."

 

  "I? BRAVE? LADY, LADY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME?"

 

  "THAT YOU HAVE A PECULIAR VIEWPOINT. THAT YOU HAVE UPHELD IT ALL THIS
TIME. THAT YOU HAVE WATCHED YOUR CAREER GO DOWNHILL. THAT YOU HAVE
CONVINCED NOBODY. AND THAT, DESPITE ALL THIS, YOU CLING TO YOUR VIEW AND
DO NOT BUDGE FROM WHAT YOU ARE CERTAIN IS RIGHT. IS NOT THIS THE ACT OF
A BRAVE MAN?"

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "YES. YES. IT IS A KIND OF BRAVERY. STILL, THERE ARE
A THOUSAND CRACKPOTS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE WHO CLUNG ALL THEIR LIVES
TO SOME RIDICULOUS VIEW AGAINST LOGIC, AGAINST EVIDENCE, AGAINST THEIR
OWN SELF-INTEREST. I MAY BE JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THEM."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, YOU MIGHT BE WRONG, BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE BRAVE. DO
YOU THINK BRAVERY IS ENTIRELY A MATTER OF PHYSICAL DARING?"

 

  "I KNOW IT IS NOT. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF BRAVERY AND PERHAPS," HE
SAID BITTERLY, "EVERY ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF BRAVERY IS A MARK OF
INSANITY OR, AT ANY RATE, FOLLY."

 

  "SURELY YOU DO NOT CONSIDER YOURSELF A COWARD?"

 

  "WHY NOT? IN SOME WAYS, I FLATTER MYSELF BY SAYING THAT I AM SANE."

 

  "BUT MAD IN YOUR STUBBORN VIEWS CONCERNING NEUROPHYSICS?"

 

  "I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED."

 

  "BUT SURELY YOU THINK YOUR VIEWS ARE CORRECT."

 

  "CERTAINLY, DR. BORANOVA. THAT WOULD BE PART OF MY MADNESS, WOULD IT
NOT?"

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "YOU ARE NOT A SERIOUS MAN. I'VE SAID THAT
BEFORE. MY COUNTRYMAN SHAPIROV THINKS YOU'RE RIGHT -- OR, IF NOT RIGHT,
AT LEAST A GENIUS."

 

  "NEXT BEST THING, CERTAINLY. PART OF HIS MADNESS, TOO."

 

  "SHAPIROV'S OPINION IS VERY SPECIAL."

 

  "TO YOU, I'M SURE. -- LOOK, LADY, I AM TIRED. I AM SO GROGGY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M NOT SURE ALL THIS IS REAL. I HOPE IT ISN'T.
LET ME JUST -- JUST REST A LITTLE."

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED AND A LOOK OF CONCERN ENTERED HER EYES. "YES, OF
COURSE, MY POOR FRIEND. WE WISH YOU NO HARM. PLEASE BELIEVE THAT."

 

  MORRISON LET HIS HEAD BOW DOWN ON HIS CHEST. HIS EYES CLOSED. DIMLY,
HE FELT HIMSELF PUSHED GENTLY TO ONE SIDE AND A PILLOW PLACED UNDER HIS
HEAD.

 

  TIME PASSED. A DREAMLESS TIME.

 

  WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES, HE WAS STILL ON THE PLANE. THERE WERE NO
LIGHTS, BUT HE KNEW WITHOUT ANY DOUBT WHATEVER THAT HE WAS STILL ON THE
PLANE.

 

  HE SAID, "DR. BORANOVA?"

 

  SHE REPLIED INSTANTLY, "YES, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  "WE'RE NOT BEING PURSUED?"

 

  "NOT AT ALL. THERE ARE SEVERAL OF OUR OWN PLANES FLYING DISTANT
INTERFERENCE, BUT THEY HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO. COME, MY FRIEND, WE WANT
YOU AND YOUR GOVERNMENT WANTS US TO HAVE YOU."

 

  "AND YOU STILL INSIST THAT YOU HAVE MINIATURIZATION? THAT IT IS NOT
MADNESS? OR A HOAX?"

 

  "YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF. AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT A WONDER IT IS, SO
THAT YOU WILL WANT TO BE PART OF IT. YOU WILL DEMAND TO BE PART OF IT."

 

  "AND WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING WITH IT," ASKED MORRISON THOUGHTFULLY,
"ASSUMING THIS IS NOT AN ELABORATE JOKE YOU ARE PLAYING ON ME? DO YOU
PLAN TO MAKE A WEAPON OF IT? TRANSPORT AN ARMY IN A PLANE LIKE THIS?
INFILTRATE EACH LAND WITH AN INVISIBLE HOST? THAT SORT OF THING?"

 

  "HOW REVOLTING!" SHE CLEARED HER THROAT AS THOUGH SHE WERE TEMPTED TO
SPIT WITH DISGUST. "HAVE WE NOT ENOUGH LAND? ENOUGH PEOPLE? ENOUGH
RESOURCES? HAVE WE NOT OUR LARGE SHARE OF SPACE? ARE THERE NOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO WITH MINIATURIZATION? CAN IT BE THAT YOU ARE SO
TWISTED AND DISTORTED THAT YOU DO NOT SEE WHAT IT WILL MEAN AS A
RESEARCH TOOL? IMAGINE THE STUDY OF LIVING SYSTEMS THAT IT WILL MAKE
POSSIBLE; THE STUDY OF CRYSTAL CHEMISTRY AND SOLID-STATE SYSTEMS; THE
CONSTRUCTION OF ULTRAMINIATURIZED COMPUTERS AND DEVICES OF ALL SORTS.
THINK FURTHER OF WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN OF PHYSICS IF WE CAN ALTER PLANCK'S
CONSTANT TO SUIT OURSELVES. WHAT MIGHT WE NOT LEARN OF COSMOLOGY?"

 

  MORRISON STRUGGLED TO SIT UPRIGHT. HE WAS STILL WOOZY, BUT THERE WAS
AN INCIPIENT DAWN OUTSIDE THE PLANE WINDOWS AND HE COULD SEE BORANOVA
VERY DIMLY.

 

  HE SAID, "IS THAT WHAT YOU WISH TO DO WITH IT, THEN? NOBLE SCIENTIFIC
ENDEAVORS?"

 

  "WHAT WOULD YOUR GOVERNMENT DO WITH IT IF YOU HAD IT? TRY TO ACHIEVE A
SUDDEN MILITARY SUPERIORITY AND RESTORE THE BAD OLD DAYS?"

 

  "NO. OF COURSE NOT."

 

  "SO THAT ONLY YOU ARE NOBLE AND ONLY WE ARE TERRIBLY EVIL? DO YOU
HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT? -- IT MAY BE, OF COURSE, THAT IF MINIATURIZATION
BECOMES SUFFICIENTLY SUCCESSFUL, THE SOVIET UNION MAY ACHIEVE A LEAD IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPACE-CENTERED SOCIETY. THINK OF TRANSPORTING
MINIATURIZED MATERIAL FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER, OF SENDING A MILLION
COLONISTS IN A SPACESHIP THAT WOULD HOUSE ONLY TWO OR THREE HUMAN BEINGS
OF NORMAL SIZE. SPACE WILL ACQUIRE A SOVIET COLORING, A SOVIET TINGE --
NOT BECAUSE THE SOVIET PEOPLE WILL DOMINATE AND BE MASTERS, BUT BECAUSE
SOVIET THOUGHT WILL HAVE WON IN THE BATTLE OF IDEAS. AND WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THAT?"

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD IN THE DIMNESS. "THEN I CERTAINLY WON'T HELP
YOU. WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO? I WON'T FASTEN SOVIET THOUGHT ON THE
UNIVERSE. I PREFER AMERICAN THOUGHT AND TRADITION."

 

  "YOU THINK YOU DO AND I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR IT. BUT WE WILL PERSUADE
YOU. YOU WILL SEE."

 

  "YOU WON'T."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "MY DEAR FRIEND ALBERT -- IF I MAY CALL YOU THAT. I
HAVE SAID THAT WE WILL BE ADMIRED FOR OUR PROGRESS. DO YOU THINK YOU
WILL BE IMMUNE? -- BUT LET US LEAVE SUCH DISCUSSIONS FOR ANOTHER TIME."

 

  SHE POINTED OUT THE PLANE WINDOW AT THE GRAY SEA BENEATH, WHICH WAS
JUST BECOMING VISIBLE.

 

  "WE ARE NOW OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN," SHE SAID, "AND SOON WE WILL BE
OVER THE BLACK SEA AND THEN ACROSS THE VOLGA TO MALENKIGRAD --
SMALLTOWN, IN ENGLISH, EH? -- AND THE SUN WILL HAVE RISEN WHEN WE LAND.
THAT WILL BE SYMBOLIC. A NEW DAY. NEW LIGHT. I PREDICT YOU WILL BE EAGER
TO HELP US ESTABLISH THIS NEW DAY AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF YOU
NEVER WISH TO LEAVE THE SOVIET UNION AGAIN."

 

  "WITHOUT YOUR FORCING ME TO STAY?"

 

  "WE WILL FLY YOU HOME FREELY IF YOU ASK US TO -- ONCE YOU HAVE HELPED
US."

 

  "I WON'T HELP YOU."

 

  "YOU WILL."

 

  "AND I DEMAND NOW THAT I BE RETURNED."

 

  "NOW DOESN'T COUNT," SAID BORANOVA CHEERFULLY.

 

  AND THEY FLEW THE LAST SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS TO MALENKIGRAD.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 3 -- MALENKIGRAD

 

  A PAWN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE ON THE CHESSBOARD -- TO A PAWN.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  FRANCIS RODANO WAS AT HIS OFFICE EARLY THE NEXT MORNING, WHICH WAS
MONDAY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THAT HE HAD WORKED ON SUNDAY WAS
COMMON ENOUGH NOT TO SURPRISE HIM. THAT HE HAD SLEPT AT ALL DURING THE
NIGHT JUST COMPLETED DID.

 

  WHEN HE ARRIVED, HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE OFFICIAL START OF THE DAY,
JONATHAN WINTHROP WAS ALREADY THERE. THAT DID NOT SURPRISE RODANO,
EITHER.

 

  WINTHROP WALKED INTO RODANO'S OFFICE WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF THE
LATTER'S ARRIVAL. HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL, THE PALMS OF HIS LARGE
HANDS HUGGING HIS ELBOWS, HIS LEFT LEG CROSSING HIS RIGHT, SO THAT THE
TOE OF HIS LEFT SHOE WAS DIGGING INTO THE CARPET.

 

  "YOU LOOK WORN-OUT, FRANK," HE SAID, HIS EYEBROWS HUNCHING LOW OVER
HIS DARK EYES.

 

  RODANO LOOKED UP AT THE OTHER'S SHOCK OF COARSE GRAY HAIR, WHICH
ROUTINELY DEPRIVED HIM OF ANY CLAIM OF HIS OWN TO SPLENDOR OF
APPEARANCE, AND SAID, "I FEEL WORN-OUT, BUT I WAS HOPING IT DIDN'T
SHOW." RODANO WAS VERY AWARE OF HAVING GONE THROUGH THE MORNING'S
RITUALS THOROUGHLY AND CAREFULLY AND OF HAVING DRESSED WITH CONSIDERABLE
JUDGMENT.

 

  "IT SHOWS, THOUGH. YOUR FACE IS THE MIRROR OF YOUR SOUL. SOME AGENT IN
THE FIELD YOU'D HAVE MADE."

 

  RODANO SAID, "WE'RE NOT ALL MADE FOR THE FIELD."

 

  "I KNOW. AND WE'RE NOT ALL MADE FOR DESK WORK, EITHER." WINTHROP
RUBBED HIS BULBOUS NOSE AS THOUGH HE WERE ANXIOUS TO FILE IT DOWN TO
NORMAL SIZE. "I TAKE IT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SCIENTIST, WHAT'S HIS
NAME?"

 

  "HIS NAME IS ALBERT JONAS MORRISON," SAID RODANO WEARILY. THERE WAS
THIS PRETENSE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF NOT KNOWING MORRISON'S NAME, AS
THOUGH EVERYONE WAS ANXIOUS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROJECT WASN'T THEIRS.

 

  "OKAY. I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOUR MENTIONING HIS NAME. I TAKE IT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIM."

 

  "YES, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM, ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. I WISH
I COULD SEE THINGS MORE CLEARLY."

 

  "WHO DOESN'T?" WINTHROP SAT DOWN. "LOOK, THERE'S NO USE WORRYING.
YOU'VE HANDLED THIS FROM THE START, AND I'VE BEEN WILLING TO LET YOU DO
SO BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED YOU'VE DONE ALL
YOU COULD TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE ONE THING ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND THE RUSSKIES."

 

  RODANO WINCED. "DON'T CALL THEM THAT. YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MANY
TWENTIETH-CENTURY MOVIES. THEY'RE NOT ALL RUSSIANS, ANY MORE THAN WE'RE
ALL ANGLO-SAXONS. THEY'RE SOVIETS. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THEM, TRY
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES."

 

  "SURE. ANYTHING YOU SAY. HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT YOUR SCIENTIST?"

 

  "NOTHING, AS FAR AS I KNOW. NO ONE TAKES HIM SERIOUSLY EXCEPT THE
SOVIETS."

 

  "DO YOU THINK THE SOVIETS KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T?"

 

  "A FEW THINGS, I'M SURE, BUT I HAVEN'T ANY NOTION OF WHAT THEY SEE IN
MORRISON. IT'S NOT THE SOVIETS, EITHER. IT'S ONE SOVIET SCIENTIST -- A
THEORETICAL PHYSICIST NAMED SHAPIROV. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE'S THE GUY
WHO WORKED OUT THE METHOD OF MINIATURIZATION -- IF THE METHOD HAS REALLY
BEEN WORKED OUT AT ALL. SCIENTISTS OUTSIDE THE SOVIET UNION ARE
AMBIVALENT ABOUT SHAPIROV. HE'S ERRATIC AND, TO PUT IT KINDLY,
ECCENTRIC. THE SOVIETS ARE ALL GUNG-HO ON HIM, HOWEVER, AND HE'S ALL
GUNG-HO ON MORRISON, THOUGH THAT MAY JUST BE ANOTHER SIGN OF HIS
ECCENTRICITY. THEN THE INTEREST IN MORRISON RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM
CURIOSITY TO DESPERATION."

 

  "AH? AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, FRANK?"

 

  "PARTLY FROM CONTACTS INSIDE THE SOVIET UNION."

 

  "ASHBY?"

 

  "PARTLY."

 

  "GOOD AGENT."

 

  "AT IT TOO LONG. NEEDS TO BE REPLACED."

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. LET'S NOT RETIRE A WINNER."

 

  "IN ANY CASE," SAID RODANO, UNWILLING TO FIGHT THE POINT, "THERE WAS A
SUDDEN MULTIPLICATION OF INTEREST IN MORRISON, ON WHOM I'D BEEN KEEPING
TABS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS."

 

  "THIS SHAPIROV, I SUPPOSE, HAD ANOTHER BRAINSTORM ABOUT MORRISON AND
PERSUADED THE RUSS-- SOVIETS THEY NEEDED HIM."

 

  "PERHAPS, BUT THE FUNNY THING IS THAT SHAPIROV SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED
OUT OF THE NEWS RECENTLY."

 

  "OUT OF FAVOR?"

 

  "NO SIGN OF THAT."

 

  "COULD BE, FRANK. IF HE'S BEEN FEEDING THE SOVIETS A LINE OF GARBAGE
ABOUT MINIATURIZATION AND THEY'VE CAUGHT ON TO IT, I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE
IN HIS SHOES. THESE MAY BE THE GOOD NEW DAYS, BUT THE SOVIETS HAVE NEVER
LEARNED TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT BEING MADE TO LOOK OR FEEL
FOOLISH."

 

  "IT COULD BE THAT HE'S GONE UNDERGROUND BECAUSE THE MINIATURIZATION
PROJECT IS HEATING UP. AND THAT COULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE SUDDEN
DESPERATION ABOUT MORRISON."

 

  "WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "ONLY THAT HE'S SURE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE."

 

  "IT MAKES NO SENSE, DOES IT?"

 

  RODANO SAID CAREFULLY, "THAT'S WHY WE LET HIM BE TAKEN. THERE'S ALWAYS
THE HOPE IT WILL SHAKE UP THE PIECES AND THAT THEY MAY THEN COME
TOGETHER IN A NEW WAY THAT WILL BEGIN TO MAKE SENSE."

 

  WINTHROP LOOKED AT HIS WATCH. "HE SHOULD BE THERE BY NOW. MALENKIGRAD.
WHAT A NAME! NO NEWS OF ANY PLANE CRASH LAST NIGHT ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD, SO I GUESS HE'S THERE."

 

  "YES -- AND JUST THE WRONG PERSON TO SEND, TOO, EXCEPT HE WAS THE ONE
THAT THE SOVIETS WANTED."

 

  "WHY IS HE WRONG? IS HE SHAKY IDEOLOGICALLY?"

 

  "I DOUBT THAT HE HAS AN IDEOLOGY. HE'S A ZERO. ALL LAST NIGHT I'VE
BEEN THINKING THAT IT'S ALL A MISTAKE. HE LACKS GUTS AND HE'S NOT VERY
BRIGHT, EXCEPT IN AN ACADEMIC SENSE. I DON'T THINK HE CAN POSSIBLY THINK
ON HIS FEET -- IF HE EVER HAS TO. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE SMART ENOUGH TO
FIND OUT ANYTHING. I SUSPECT HE'LL BE IN ONE LONG PANIC FROM BEGINNING
TO END AND I'VE BEEN THINKING FOR HOURS NOW THAT WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM
AGAIN. THEY'LL IMPRISON HIM -- OR KILL HIM -- AND I'VE SENT HIM THERE."

 

  "THAT'S JUST MIDDLE-OF-THE-NIGHT BLUES, FRANK. NO MATTER HOW DUMB HE
IS, HE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL US WHETHER HE WATCHED A DEMONSTRATION OF
MINIATURIZATION, FOR INSTANCE, OR WHAT IT WAS THEY DID TO HIM. HE
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SHREWD OBSERVER. HE NEED ONLY TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
AND WE WILL DO THE NECESSARY THINKING."

 

  "BUT, JON, WE MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN."

 

  WINTHROP PLACED HIS HAND ON RODANO'S SHOULDER. "DON'T BEGIN BY
ASSUMING DISASTER. I'LL SEE THAT ASHBY GETS THE WORD. IF SOMETHING CAN
BE DONE, IT WILL BE DONE AND I'M SURE THE RUSS-- SOVIETS WILL HIT A SANE
MOMENT AND LET HIM GO IF WE PUT ON ENOUGH QUIET PRESSURE WHEN THE TIME
COMES. DON'T MAKE YOURSELF SICK OVER IT. IT'S A MOVE IN A COMPLEX GAME
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, IT DOESN'T WORK. THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHER
MOVES ON THE BOARD."

 

  12.

 

  MORRISON FELT HAGGARD. HE HAD SLEPT THROUGH MUCH OF MONDAY, HOPING IT
WOULD RID HIM OF THE WORST OF HIS JET LAG. HE HAD EATEN GRATEFULLY OF
THE FOOD THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN TOWARD EVENING, HAD PARTAKEN EVEN MORE
GRATEFULLY OF A SHOWER. FRESH CLOTHING WAS GIVEN HIM THAT FIT RATHER
INDIFFERENTLY -- BUT WHAT OF THAT? AND HE HAD SPENT MONDAY NIGHT
ALTERNATELY SLEEPING AND READING.

 

  AND BROODING.

 

  THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT, THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS THAT NATALYA
BORANOVA WAS CORRECT IN HER ESTIMATE THAT HE WAS HERE ONLY BECAUSE THE
UNITED STATES WAS SATISFIED TO HAVE HIM HERE. RODANO HAD URGED HIM TO
GO, HAD VAGUELY THREATENED HIM WITH FURTHER CAREER TROUBLES (HOW MUCH
DEEPER IN TROUBLE COULD HE POSSIBLY GET?) IF HE DID NOT GO. WHY, THEN,
SHOULD THEY OBJECT TO HIS HAVING BEEN TAKEN? THEY MIGHT OBJECT ON
PRINCIPLE OR FEEL THERE WAS THE DANGER OF SETTING AN UNDESIRABLE
PRECEDENT, BUT APPARENTLY THEIR OWN EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GO HAD
OVERRULED THAT.

 

  WHAT, THEN, WOULD BE THE POINT IN DEMANDING TO BE TAKEN TO THE NEAREST
AMERICAN CONSUL OR IN MAKING WILD THREATS OF AMERICAN RETALIATION?

 

  AS A MATTER OF FACT, NOW THAT THE DEED HAD BEEN DONE WITH AMERICAN
CONNIVANCE -- SURELY WITH AMERICAN CONNIVANCE -- IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE OPEN ACTION ON HIS BEHALF OR EXPRESS ANY
INDIGNATION WHATEVER. QUESTIONS WOULD INEVITABLY ARISE AS TO HOW THE
SOVIETS HAD MANAGED TO SPIRIT HIM OFF AND THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER OTHER
THAN AMERICAN STUPIDITY OR AMERICAN CONNIVANCE. AND SURELY THE UNITED
STATES WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THE WORLD COME TO EITHER CONCLUSION.

 

  OF COURSE, HE COULD SEE WHY THIS HAD BEEN DONE. IT WAS AS RODANO HAD
EXPLAINED. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WANTED INFORMATION AND HE WAS IN AN
IDEAL POSITION TO GET IT FOR THEM.

 

  IDEAL? IN WHAT WAY? THE SOVIETS WOULD NOT BE FOOLS ENOUGH TO LET HIM
GET ANY INFORMATION THEY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO HAVE AND IF THEY THOUGHT
THAT THE INFORMATION HE MANAGED TO GET (OR COULDN'T AVOID GETTING) WAS
TOO MUCH, THEY WOULD NOT BE FOOLS ENOUGH TO LET HIM GO.

 

  THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF THAT, THE MORE HE FELT THAT, DEAD OR ALIVE, HE
WOULD NEVER SEE THE UNITED STATES AGAIN AND THAT THE AMERICAN
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WOULD SHRUG ITS COLLECTIVE SHOULDERS AND WRITE IT
ALL OFF AS AN UNAVOIDABLE MISS -- NOTHING GAINED BUT, THEN AGAIN,
NOTHING MUCH LOST.

 

  MORRISON ASSESSED HIMSELF -- ALBERT JONAS MORRISON, PH.D., ASSISTANT
PROFESSOR OF NEUROPHYSICS, ORIGINATOR OF A THEORY OF THOUGHT THAT
REMAINED UNACCEPTED AND ALL BUT IGNORED; FAILED HUSBAND, FAILED FATHER,
FAILED SCIENTIST, AND NOW FAILED PAWN. NOTHING MUCH LOST.

 

  IN THE DEPTH OF THE NIGHT, IN A HOTEL ROOM IN A TOWN HE DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THE LOCATION OF, IN A NATION THAT FOR OVER A CENTURY HAD SEEMED THE
NATURAL ENEMY OF HIS OWN, HOWEVER MUCH A SPIRIT OF RELUCTANT AND
SUSPICIOUS COOPERATION MIGHT RULE IN THE LAST FEW DECADES, MORRISON
FOUND HIMSELF WEEPING OUT OF SELF-PITY AND OUT OF SHEER CHILDISH
HELPLESSNESS -- OUT OF A FEELING OF UTTER HUMILIATION THAT NO ONE SHOULD
THINK HIM WORTH STRUGGLING FOR OR EVEN WASTING REGRET OVER.

 

  AND YET -- AND HERE A SMALL SPARK OF PRIDE MANAGED TO SURFACE -- THE
SOVIETS HAD WANTED HIM. THEY HAD GONE TO CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE TO GET
HIM. WHEN PERSUASION HAD FAILED, THEY HAD NOT HESITATED TO USE FORCE.
THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN CERTAIN THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD
STUDIOUSLY LOOK THE OTHER WAY. THEY HAD RISKED AN INTERNATIONAL
INCIDENT, HOWEVER SLIGHTLY, TO GET HIM.

 

  AND THEY WERE GOING TO CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE TO KEEP HIM SAFE NOW THAT
THEY HAD HIM. HE WAS HERE ALONE, BUT THE WINDOWS, HE NOTED, HAD BARS ON
THEM. THE DOOR WAS NOT LOCKED, BUT WHEN, EARLIER, HE HAD OPENED IT, TWO
UNIFORMED AND ARMED MEN LOOKED UP FROM WHERE THEY HAD BEEN LOUNGING
AGAINST THE OPPOSITE WALL AND ASKED HIM IF HE WERE IN NEED OF ANYTHING.
HE DIDN'T LIKE BEING IN PRISON, BUT IT WAS A MEASURE, OF SORTS, OF HIS
VALUE -- AT LEAST HERE.

 

  HOW LONG WOULD THIS LAST? EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE UNDER THE
IMPRESSION THAT HIS THEORY OF THOUGHT WAS CORRECT, MORRISON HIMSELF HAD
TO ADMIT THAT IT REMAINED A FACT THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAD GATHERED
WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND TERRIBLY INDIRECT -- AND THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN
ABLE TO CONFIRM HIS MOST USEFUL FINDINGS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE
SOVIETS FOUND THAT THEY, TOO, COULD NOT CONFIRM THEM OR IF, ON CLOSER
CONSIDERATION, THEY FOUND IT ALL TOO GASEOUS, TOO VAPOROUS, TOO
ATMOSPHERIC TO TROUBLE WITH.

 

  BORANOVA HAD SAID SHAPIROV HAD THOUGHT HIGHLY OF MORRISON'S
SUGGESTIONS, BUT SHAPIROV WAS A NOTORIOUS WILD MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND
DAILY.

 

  AND IF SHAPIROV SHRUGGED AND TURNED AWAY, WHAT WOULD THE SOVIETS DO?
IF THEIR AMERICAN TROPHY WERE OF NO USE TO THEM, WOULD THEY RETURN HIM
CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO THE UNITED STATES (ONE MORE HUMILIATION, IN A WAY) OR
HIDE THEIR OWN FOLLY IN TAKING HIM, BY IMPRISONING HIM INDEFINITELY --
OR WORSE.

 

  IN FACT, IT HAD BEEN SOME SOVIET FUNCTIONARY, SOME SPECIFIC PERSON,
WHO MUST HAVE DECIDED TO KIDNAP HIM AND RISK AN INCIDENT AND IF THE
WHOLE THING TURNED SOUR, WHAT WOULD THAT FUNCTIONARY DO TO SAVE HIS OWN
NECK -- UNDOUBTEDLY AT THE EXPENSE OF MORRISON'S?

 

  BY DAWN ON TUESDAY, WHEN MORRISON HAD BEEN IN THE SOVIET UNION FOR A
FULL DAY, HE HAD CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT EVERY PATH INTO THE FUTURE,
EVERY ALTERNATIVE ROUTE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE TAKEN, WOULD END IN
DISASTER FOR HIM. HE WATCHED THE DAY BREAK, BUT HIS SPIRITS REMAINED IN
DEEPEST NIGHT.

 

  13.

 

  THERE WAS A BRUSQUE KNOCK AT HIS DOOR AT 8 A.M. HE OPENED IT A CRACK
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE OTHER SIDE PUSHED IT OPEN FARTHER, AS THOUGH TO
INDICATE WHO IT WAS WHO CONTROLLED THE DOOR.

 

  THE SOLDIER SAID, MORE LOUDLY THAN NECESSARY, "MADAME BORANOVA WILL BE
HERE IN HALF AN HOUR TO TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST. BE READY."

 

  WHILE HE DRESSED HURRIEDLY AND MADE USE OF AN ELECTRIC RAZOR OF RATHER
ANCIENT DESIGN BY AMERICAN STANDARDS, HE WONDERED WHY ON EARTH HE HAD
BEEN FAINTLY ASTONISHED AT HEARING THE SOLDIER SPEAK OF MADAME BORANOVA.
THE ARCHAIC "COMRADE" HAD LONG PASSED OUT OF USE.

 

  IT MADE HIM FEEL IRRITABLE AND FOOLISH, TOO, SINCE OF WHAT VALUE WAS
IT TO BROOD OVER TINY THINGS IN THE MIDST OF THE VAST MORASS IN WHICH HE
FOUND HIMSELF? -- EXCEPT THAT THAT WAS WHAT PEOPLE DID, HE KNEW.

 

  BORANOVA WAS TEN MINUTES LATE. SHE KNOCKED MORE GENTLY THAN THE
SOLDIER HAD AND WHEN SHE ENTERED SAID, "HOW DO YOU FEEL, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  "I FEEL KIDNAPPED," HE SAID STIFFLY.

 

  "ASIDE FROM THAT. HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH SLEEP?"

 

  "I MAY HAVE. I CAN'T TELL. FRANKLY, MADAME, I'M IN NO MOOD TO TELL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME?"

 

  "AT THE MOMENT, NOTHING BUT TO TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST. AND PLEASE, DR.
MORRISON, DO BELIEVE THAT I AM AS MUCH UNDER COMPULSION AS YOU ARE. I
ASSURE YOU THAT I WOULD RATHER, AT THIS MOMENT, BE WITH MY LITTLE
ALEKSANDR. I HAVE NEGLECTED HIM SADLY IN RECENT MONTHS AND NIKOLAI IS
NOT PLEASED AT MY ABSENCE, EITHER. BUT WHEN HE MARRIED ME, HE KNEW I HAD
A CAREER, AS I KEEP TELLING HIM."

 

  "AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, YOU ARE FREE TO SEND ME BACK TO MY OWN
COUNTRY AND SPEND ALL YOUR TIME WITH ALEKSANDR AND NIKOLAI."

 

  "AH, IF THAT COULD BE SO -- BUT IT CANNOT. SO COME, LET US GO TO
BREAKFAST. WE COULD EAT HERE, BUT YOU WOULD FEEL IMPRISONED. LET US EAT
IN THE DINING ROOM AND YOU WILL FEEL BETTER."

 

  "WILL I? THOSE TWO SOLDIERS OUTSIDE WILL FOLLOW US, WON'T THEY?"

 

  "REGULATIONS, DR. MORRISON. THIS IS A HIGH-SECURITY ZONE. THEY MUST
GUARD YOU UNTIL SOMEONE IN CHARGE IS CONVINCED THAT IT IS SAFE NOT TO
GUARD YOU -- AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE THEM OF THAT. IT IS
THEIR JOB NOT TO BE CONVINCED."

 

  "I'LL BET," SAID MORRISON, SHRUGGING HIMSELF INTO THE JACKET THEY HAD
GIVEN HIM, WHICH WAS RATHER TIGHT UNDER THE ARMPITS.

 

  "THEY WILL IN NO WAY INTERFERE WITH US, HOWEVER."

 

  "BUT IF I SUDDENLY BREAK AWAY OR EVEN JUST MOVE IN AN UNAUTHORIZED
DIRECTION, I ASSUME THEY WILL SHOOT ME DEAD."

 

  "NO, THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR THEM. YOU ARE VALUABLE ALIVE, NOT DEAD.
THEY WOULD PURSUE YOU AND, EVENTUALLY, SEIZE YOU. -- BUT THEN, I'M SURE
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MUST DO NOTHING THAT WOULD BE USELESSLY
TROUBLESOME."

 

  MORRISON FROWNED, MAKING LITTLE EFFORT TO HIDE HIS ANGER. "WHEN DO I
GET MY OWN BAGGAGE BACK? MY OWN CLOTHES?"

 

  "IN TIME. THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO EAT."

 

  THE DINING ROOM, WHICH THEY REACHED BY AN ELEVATOR AND A RATHER LONG
WALK ALONG A DESERTED CORRIDOR, WAS NOT VERY LARGE. IT CONTAINED A DOZEN
TABLES, EACH ONE SEATING SIX, AND IT WAS NOT CROWDED.

 

  BORANOVA AND MORRISON WERE ALONE AT THEIR TABLE AND NO ONE OFFERED TO
JOIN THEM. THE TWO SOLDIERS WERE AT A TABLE NEAR THE DOOR AND THOUGH
THEY EACH ATE ENOUGH FOR TWO, THEY FACED MORRISON AND THEIR EYES NEVER
LEFT HIM FOR MORE THAN A SECOND OR TWO.

 

  THERE WAS NO MENU. FOOD WAS SIMPLY BROUGHT TO THEM AND MORRISON FOUND
HE HAD NO QUARREL OVER THE QUANTITY. THERE WERE HARD-BOILED EGGS, BOILED
POTATOES, CABBAGE SOUP, AND CAVIAR, ALONG WITH THICK SLICES OF DARK
BREAD. THEY WERE NOT GIVEN OUT IN INDIVIDUAL PORTIONS, BUT WERE PLACED
IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE WHERE EACH PERSON COULD HELP HIMSELF.

 

  PERHAPS, THOUGHT MORRISON, THEY BRING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED SIX AND,
SINCE WE TWO ARE THE ONLY ONES HERE, WE SHOULD ONLY CONSUME A THIRD. AND
AFTER A WHILE, HE HAD TO ADMIT THAT WITH A FULL STOMACH HE FELT A LITTLE
MOLLIFIED. HE SAID, "MADAME BORANOVA --"

 

  "WHY NOT CALL ME NATALYA, DR. MORRISON? WE ARE VERY INFORMAL HERE AND
WE WILL BE COLLEAGUES FOR PERHAPS AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE
REPEATED 'MADAMES' WILL GIVE ME A HEADACHE. MY FRIENDS EVEN CALL ME
NATASHA. IT COULD COME TO THAT."

 

  SHE SMILED, BUT MORRISON FELT STUBBORNLY INDISPOSED TO BE INGRATIATED.
HE SAID, "MADAME, WHEN I FEEL FRIENDLY, I WILL CERTAINLY ACT FRIENDLY,
BUT AS A VICTIM AND AN INVOLUNTARY PRESENCE HERE, I PREFER A CERTAIN
FORMALITY."

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED. SHE BIT OFF A SIZABLE CHUNK OF BREAD AND CHEWED
MOODILY. THEN, SWALLOWING, SHE SAID, "LET IT BE AS YOU WISH, BUT PLEASE
SPARE ME THE 'MADAMES.' LET ME HAVE MY PROFESSIONAL TITLE -- AND I DON'T
MEAN 'ACADEMICIAN.' TOO MANY SYLLABLES. -- BUT I INTERRUPTED YOU."

 

  "DR. BORANOVA," SAID MORRISON, MORE COLDLY THAN BEFORE. "YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME. YOU MENTIONED MINIATURIZATION, BUT
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. I THINK THAT YOU SPOKE OF
IT MERELY TO MISLEAD -- TO MISLEAD ME AND TO MISLEAD ANYONE OVERHEARING
US. LET US DROP THAT, THEN. SURELY HERE WE HAVE NO NEED TO PLAY GAMES.
TELL ME WHY I AM REALLY HERE. AFTER ALL, EVENTUALLY YOU MUST, SINCE YOU
APPARENTLY EXPECT ME TO BE OF SOME USE TO YOU AND I CAN'T BE THAT IF I
AM LEFT COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WISH."

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "YOU ARE A HARD MAN TO CONVINCE, DR.
MORRISON. I HAVE BEEN TRUTHFUL WITH YOU FROM THE START. THE PROJECT IS
ONE OF MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT."

 

  "WHY, THEN, ARE YOU IN THE CITY OF MALENKIGRAD?"

 

  "SMALL CITY? LITTLETOWN? TINYBURG?" SAID MORRISON, FEELING A PLEASURE
IN HEARING HIS OWN VOICE SOUND THE PHRASES IN ENGLISH. "PERHAPS BECAUSE
IT IS A SMALL CITY."

 

  "AS I HAVE HAD PERIODIC OCCASION TO SAY, DR. MORRISON, YOU ARE NOT A
SERIOUS MAN. STILL, YOU WILL NOT BE IN DOUBT LONG. THERE ARE A FEW
PEOPLE YOU SHOULD MEET. ONE OF THEM SHOULD, IN FACT, BE HERE BY NOW."
SHE LOOKED AROUND WITH AN ANNOYED FROWN. "SO WHERE IS HE?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I NOTICE THAT NO ONE APPROACHES US. EVERY ONCE IN A
WHILE, THE PEOPLE AT THE OTHER TABLES LOOK AT ME, BUT THEN THEY LOOK
AWAY IF THEY CATCH MY EYE."

 

  "THEY HAVE BEEN WARNED," SAID BORANOVA ABSENTLY. "WE WILL NOT WASTE
YOUR TIME WITH IRRELEVANCIES AND ALMOST EVERYONE HERE IS AN IRRELEVANCY
AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED. BUT SOME ARE NOT. WHERE IS HE?" SHE ROSE.
"DR. MORRISON, EXCUSE ME. I MUST FIND HIM. I WILL NOT BE GONE LONG."

 

  "IS IT SAFE TO LEAVE ME?" SAID MORRISON SARDONICALLY.

 

  "THE SOLDIERS WILL REMAIN, DR. MORRISON. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THEM CAUSE
TO REACT. INTELLECT IS NOT THEIR FORTE AND THEY ARE TRAINED TO FOLLOW
ORDERS WITHOUT THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF THINKING, SO THEY MIGHT EASILY
HURT YOU."

 

  "DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE CAREFUL."

 

  SHE LEFT, MOVING HURRIEDLY OUT THE DOOR AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS
WITH THE SOLDIERS AS SHE PASSED.

 

  MORRISON WATCHED HER GO, THEN GLANCED OVER THE DINING ROOM MOROSELY.
HAVING FOUND NOTHING OF INTEREST, HE BENT HIS EYES UPON HIS CLASPED
HANDS ON THE TABLE AND THEN STARED AT THE STILL-SIZABLE PORTIONS OF
UNCONSUMED FOOD BEFORE HIM.

 

  "ARE YOU ALL THROUGH, COMRADE?"

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP SHARPLY. HE HAD DECIDED "COMRADE" WAS AN ARCHAISM,
HADN'T HE?

 

  -- A WOMAN WAS STANDING, LOOKING AT HIM, WITH ONE BALLED FIST ON HER
HIP IN A NEGLIGENT MANNER. SHE WAS A REASONABLY PLUMP WOMAN IN A WHITE
UNIFORM, SLIGHTLY STAINED. HER HAIR WAS REDDISH-BROWN, AS WERE HER
EYEBROWS, WHICH ARCHED DISDAINFULLY.

 

  "WHO ARE YOU?" ASKED MORRISON, FROWNING.

 

  "MY NAME? VALERI PALERON. MY FUNCTION? HARDWORKING SERVING WOMAN, BUT
SOVIET CITIZEN AND MEMBER OF THE PARTY. I BROUGHT YOU THIS FOOD. DIDN'T
YOU NOTICE ME? AM I BENEATH YOUR NOTICE, PERHAPS?"

 

  MORRISON CLEARED HIS THROAT. "I'M SORRY, MISS. I HAVE OTHER THINGS ON
MY MIND. -- BUT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE THE FOOD. SOMEONE ELSE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE COMING HERE, I THINK."

 

  "AH! AND THE TSARINA? SHE WILL BE BACK, TOO, I SUPPOSE?"

 

  "THE TSARINA?"

 

  "YOU DON'T THINK WE HAVE TSARINAS ANY LONGER IN THE SOVIET UNION?
THINK AGAIN, COMRADE. THIS BORANOVA, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF PEASANTS AND A
LONG LINE OF PEASANTS, CONSIDERS HERSELF QUITE A LADY, I'M SURE." SHE
MADE A SOUND WITH HER LIPS LIKE A LONG "PSH-SH-SH," REDOLENT WITH
CONTEMPT AND A TOUCH OF HERRING.

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "I DO NOT KNOW HER VERY WELL."

 

  "YOU ARE AN AMERICAN, AREN'T YOU?"

 

  MORRISON SAID SHARPLY, "WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?"

 

  "BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN. WITH THAT ACCENT, WHAT WOULD
YOU BE? THE SON OF TSAR NICHOLAS THE TYRANT?"

 

  "WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WAY I SPEAK RUSSIAN?"

 

  "IT CLASHES AS THOUGH YOU LEARNED IT IN SCHOOL. YOU CAN HEAR AN
AMERICAN A KILOMETER AWAY AS SOON AS HE SAYS, 'A GLASS OF VODKA,
PLEASE.' HE IS NOT AS BAD AS AN ENGLISHMAN, OF COURSE. HIM YOU CAN HEAR
TWO KILOMETERS AWAY."

 

  "WELL, THEN, I'M AN AMERICAN."

 

  "AND YOU'LL BE GOING HOME SOMEDAY?"

 

  "I CERTAINLY HOPE SO."

 

  THE SERVING WOMAN NODDED HER HEAD QUIETLY, PULLED OUT A RAG, AND WIPED
THE TABLE THOUGHTFULLY. "I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES
SOMEDAY."

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "WHY NOT?"

 

  "I NEED A PASSPORT."

 

  "OF COURSE."

 

  "AND HOW DOES A SIMPLE, LOYAL SERVING WOMAN GET ONE?"

 

  "I SUPPOSE YOU MUST APPLY FOR ONE."

 

  "APPLY? IF I GO TO A FUNCTIONARY AND I SAY, 'I, VALERI PALERON, WISH
TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES,' HE WILL SAY, 'WHY?'"

 

  "AND WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO?"

 

  "TO SEE THE COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE. THE WEALTH. I AM CURIOUS HOW THEY
LIVE. -- THAT WOULD NOT BE REASON ENOUGH."

 

  "SAY SOMETHING ELSE," SAID MORRISON. "SAY YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AS A LESSON TO SOVIET YOUTH."

 

  "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY BOOKS --"

 

  SHE STIFFENED AND BEGAN TO WIPE THE TABLE AGAIN, SUDDENLY ABSORBED IN
HER WORK.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP. BORANOVA WAS STANDING THERE, HER EYES HARD AND
ANGRY. SHE UTTERED A HARSH MONOSYLLABLE THAT MORRISON DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
BUT THAT HE COULD HAVE SWORN WAS AN EPITHET AND NOT A VERY POLITE ONE,
EITHER.

 

  THE SERVING WOMAN FLUSHED DULLY. BORANOVA MADE A SMALL GESTURE WITH
HER HAND AND THE WOMAN TURNED AND LEFT.

 

  MORRISON NOTICED THAT A MAN STOOD BEHIND BORANOVA -- SHORT,
THICK-NECKED, WITH NARROWED EYES, LARGE EARS, AND A BROAD-SHOULDERED,
MUSCULAR BODY. HIS HAIR WAS BLACK, LONGER THAN USUAL FOR A RUSSIAN, AND
IT WAS IN WILD DISARRAY, AS THOUGH HE CLUTCHED AT IT A GREAT DEAL.

 

  BORANOVA MADE NO MOVE TO INTRODUCE HIM. SHE SAID, "WAS THAT WOMAN
TALKING TO YOU?"

 

  "YES," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "SHE RECOGNIZED YOU TO BE AN AMERICAN?"

 

  "SHE SAID MY ACCENT MADE IT OBVIOUS."

 

  "AND SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES?"

 

  "YES, SHE DID."

 

  "WHAT DID YOU SAY? DID YOU OFFER TO HELP HER GO THERE?"

 

  "I ADVISED HER TO APPLY FOR A PASSPORT IF SHE WANTED TO GO."

 

  "NOTHING MORE?"

 

  "NOTHING MORE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID WITH DISCONTENT, "YOU MUST PAY NO ATTENTION TO HER. SHE
IS AN IGNORANT AND UNCULTURED WOMAN. -- LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU MY
FRIEND, ARKADY VISSARIONOVICH DEZHNEV. THIS IS DR. ALBERT JONAS
MORRISON, ARKADY."

 

  DEZHNEV MANAGED A CLUMSY BOW AND SAID, "I HAVE HEARD OF YOU, DR.
MORRISON. ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV HAS SPOKEN OF YOU OFTEN."

 

  MORRISON SAID COLDLY, "I AM FLATTERED. -- BUT TELL ME, DR. BORANOVA,
IF THAT SERVING WOMAN ANNOYS YOU SO MUCH, IT SHOULD BE AN EASY TASK TO
HAVE HER REPLACED OR TRANSFERRED."

 

  DEZHNEV LAUGHED HARSHLY. "NOT A CHANCE, COMRADE AMERICAN -- WHICH I
EXPECT IS WHAT SHE CALLED YOU --"

 

  "NOT ACTUALLY."

 

  "THEN SHE WOULD HAVE SOONER OR LATER, HAD WE NOT INTERRUPTED YOU. THAT
WOMAN, I SUSPECT, MAY BE AN INTELLIGENCE OPERATOR AND IS ONE OF THOSE
WHO KEEPS A CLOSE EYE ON US.

 

  "BUT WHY --?"

 

  "BECAUSE WITH AN OPERATION LIKE THIS, NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED ENTIRELY.
WHEN YOU AMERICANS ARE ENGAGED IN BREAKTHROUGH SCIENCE, ARE YOU NOT KEPT
UNDER CLOSE OBSERVATION?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW," SAID MORRISON STIFFLY. "I HAVE NEVER BEEN ENGAGED IN
ANY BREAKTHROUGH SCIENCE THAT MY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IN THE LEAST
INTERESTED IN. -- BUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK IS, WHY DOES THAT WOMAN
ACT AS SHE DOES IF SHE IS AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT?"

 

  "TO BE A PROVOCATEUR, OBVIOUSLY. TO SAY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS AND TO SEE
WHAT SHE CAN TRIP SOMEONE ELSE INTO SAYING."

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "WELL, IT'S YOUR WORRY, NOT MINE."

 

  "AS YOU SAY," SAID DEZHNEV. HE TURNED TO BORANOVA. "NATASHA, HAVE YOU
TOLD HIM YET?"

 

  "PLEASE, ARKADY--"

 

  "NOW COME, NATASHA. AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY, 'IF YOU MUST PULL A
TOOTH, IT IS MISTAKEN KINDNESS TO PULL IT SLOWLY.' LET'S TELL HIM."

 

  "I HAVE TOLD HIM WE'RE INVOLVED IN MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "IS THAT ALL?" SAID DEZHNEV. HE SAT DOWN, PULLED HIS CHAIR NEXT TO
THAT OF MORRISON, AND LEANED TOWARD HIM. MORRISON, WITH HIS PERSONAL
SPACE INVADED, AUTOMATICALLY WITHDREW. DEZHNEV CAME CLOSER STILL AND
SAID, "COMRADE AMERICAN, MY FRIEND NATASHA IS A ROMANTIC AND SHE IS
CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL WANT TO HELP US FOR LOVE OF SCIENCE. SHE FEELS
THAT WE CAN PERSUADE YOU TO DO GLADLY WHAT MUST BE DONE. SHE IS WRONG.
YOU WILL NOT BE PERSUADED ANY MORE THAN YOU WERE PERSUADED TO COME HERE
VOLUNTARILY."

 

  "ARKADY, YOU ARE BEING BOORISH," SNAPPED BORANOVA.

 

  "NO, NATASHA, I AM BEING HONEST -- WHICH IS SOMETIMES THE SAME THING.
DR. MORRISON -- OR ALBERT, TO AVOID FORMALITY, WHICH I HATE" -- HE
SHUDDERED DRAMATICALLY -- "SINCE YOU WON'T BE PERSUADED AND SINCE WE
HAVE NO TIME, YOU WILL DO WHAT WE WANT BY FORCE, AS YOU WERE BROUGHT
HERE BY FORCE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ARKADY, YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T --"

 

  "I DO NOT CARE. I HAVE THOUGHT SINCE I PROMISED AND I HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE AMERICAN MUST KNOW WHAT HE FACES. IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US --
AND IT WILL BE EASIER FOR HIM, TOO."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND HIS THROAT TIGHTENED SO THAT
IT GREW DIFFICULT TO BREATHE. WHATEVER IT WAS THEY PLANNED FOR HIM, HE
KNEW HE WOULD BE GIVEN NO CHOICE.

 

  14.

 

  MORRISON CONTINUED TO BE SILENT WHILE DEZHNEV, UNCONCERNED, PROCEEDED
TO EAT HIS OWN BREAKFAST WITH RELISH.

 

  THE DINING ROOM HAD MORE OR LESS EMPTIED OUT AND THE SERVING WOMAN,
VALERI PALERON, WAS CARRYING OFF THE REMAINS AND WAS WIPING DOWN THE
CHAIRS AND TABLES.

 

  DEZHNEV CAUGHT HER EYE, BECKONED TO HER, AND INDICATED THAT THE TABLE
WAS TO BE CLEARED.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "SO I HAVE NO CHOICE. NO CHOICE IN WHAT?"

 

  "HAH! HAS NATASHA NOT EVEN TOLD YOU THAT?" REPLIED DEZHNEV.

 

  "SHE TOLD ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT I WAS TO BE INVOLVED IN
MINIATURIZATION PROBLEMS. BUT I KNOW -- AND YOU KNOW -- THAT THERE IS NO
MINIATURIZATION PROBLEM EXCEPT THAT OF TRYING TO TURN AN IMPOSSIBILITY
INTO FACT -- AND I CERTAINLY CAN'T HELP YOU IN THAT. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE FOR ME TO DO."

 

  DEZHNEV LOOKED AMUSED. "WHY DO YOU THINK MINIATURIZATION IS
IMPOSSIBLE?"

 

  "BECAUSE IT IS."

 

  "AND IF I TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE IT?"

 

  "THEN I SAY SHOW ME!"

 

  DEZHNEV TURNED TO BORANOVA, WHO DREW A DEEP BREATH AND NODDED.

 

  DEZHNEV ROSE. HE SAID, "COME. WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE GROTTO."

 

  MORRISON BIT HIS LIP IN VEXATION. SMALL FRUSTRATIONS LOOMED LARGE. "I
DO NOT KNOW THAT RUSSIAN WORD YOU'VE USED."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE HAVE AN UNDERGROUND LABORATORY HERE. WE CALL IT THE
GROTTO. IT IS ONE OF OUR POETIC WORDS, NOT USED IN ORDINARY
CONVERSATION. THE GROTTO IS THE SITE OF OUR MINIATURIZATION PROJECT."

 

  15.

 

  OUTSIDE AN AIR-JET AWAITED THEM. MORRISON BLINKED, ADJUSTING HIS EYES
TO THE SUNLIGHT. HE REGARDED THE JET CURIOUSLY. IT LACKED THE
ELABORATION OF AMERICAN MODELS AND SEEMED LITTLE MORE THAN A SLED WITH
SMALL SEATS AND WITH A COMPLEX ENGINE IN FRONT. IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY
USELESS IN COLD OR WET WEATHER AND HE WONDERED WHETHER THE SOVIETS HAD
AN ENCLOSED VERSION FOR THOSE TIMES. PERHAPS THIS WAS JUST A SUMMER
RUNABOUT.

 

  DEZHNEV TOOK THE CONTROLS AND BORANOVA DIRECTED MORRISON INTO THE SEAT
BEHIND DEZHNEV, WHILE SHE TOOK THE ONE TO HIS RIGHT SIDE. SHE TURNED TO
THE GUARDS AND SAID, "GO BACK TO THE HOTEL AND WAIT FOR US THERE. WE
WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FROM THIS POINT." SHE HANDED THEM A
PRINTED SLIP OF PAPER ON WHICH SHE SCRAWLED HER SIGNATURE, THE DATE,
AND, AFTER CONSULTING HER WRISTWATCH, THE TIME.

 

  WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MALENKIGRAD, MORRISON DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS A
SMALL TOWN IN FACT, AS WELL AS IN NAME. THERE WERE ROWS OF HOUSES --
EACH TWO STORIES HIGH -- WITH A DEADLY SAMENESS ABOUT THEM. THE TOWN HAD
CLEARLY BEEN BUILT FOR THOSE WHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT -- WHATEVER IT
WAS THAT THEY MASKED WITH THE FAIRY TALE OF MINIATURIZATION -- AND IT
HAD BEEN BUILT WITHOUT UNDUE EXPENSE. EACH HOUSE HAD ITS OWN VEGETABLE
GARDEN AND THE STREETS, ALTHOUGH PAVED, HAD AN UNFINISHED LOOK ABOUT
THEM.

 

  THE LITTLE CRAFT, RIDING ON THE JETS OF AIR PUSHING AGAINST THE
GROUND, BLEW UP A SMALL CLOUD OF DUST, WHICH WAS, FOR THE MOST PART,
LEFT BEHIND AS THEY PROGRESSED SMOOTHLY FORWARD. MORRISON COULD SEE THAT
IT WAS NOT COMFORTABLE FOR THE PEDESTRIANS THEY PASSED WHO, ONE AND ALL,
TOOK EVASIVE ACTION AS IT APPROACHED.

 

  MORRISON FELT THE DISCOMFORT IN FULL WHEN THEY PASSED AN AIR-JET
MOVING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND WAS INUNDATED IN THE DUST.

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AMUSED. SHE COUGHED AND SAID, "DO NOT BE CONCERNED. WE
WILL BE VACUUMED SOON."

 

  "VACUUMED?" ASKED MORRISON, COUGHING ALSO.

 

  "YES. NOT SO MUCH FOR US, FOR WE CAN LIVE WITH A LITTLE DUST, BUT THE
GROTTO MUST BE REASONABLY DUST-FREE."

 

  "SO MUST MY LUNGS. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO HAVE THESE AIR-JETS
ENCLOSED?"

 

  "THEY PROMISE US SHIPMENTS OF MORE ELABORATE MODELS AND PERHAPS
SOMEDAY THEY WILL ARRIVE. MEANWHILE, THIS IS A NEW TOWN AND IT IS BUILT
IN THE STEPPES, WHERE THE CLIMATE IS ARID. THAT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES --
AND ITS DISADVANTAGES, TOO. THE SETTLERS GROW VEGETABLES, AS YOU SAW,
AND THEY HAVE SOME ANIMALS, TOO, BUT LARGE-SCALE AGRICULTURE MUST WAIT
UNTIL THE COMMUNITY IS LARGER AND THERE ARE IRRIGATION FACILITIES. FOR
NOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT IS MINIATURIZATION THAT CONCERNS US."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "YOU SPEAK OF MINIATURIZATION SO OFTEN AND
WITH SUCH A STRAIGHT FACE, YOU MIGHT ALMOST TRICK ME INTO BELIEVING IT."

 

  "BELIEVE IT. YOU WILL HAVE THE DEMONSTRATION DEZHNEV ARRANGED."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID FROM HIS SEAT AT THE CONTROLS, "AND I HAD TROUBLE DOING
SO. ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO SPEAK TO THE CENTRAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE --
MAY WHAT IS LEFT OF THEIR GRAY HAIRS FALL OUT. AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY,
'APES WERE INVENTED BECAUSE POLITICIANS WERE NEEDED.' HOW IT IS POSSIBLE
TO SIT TWO THOUSAND KILOMETERS AWAY AND MAKE POLICY --"

 

  THE AIR-JET GLIDED SMOOTHLY FORWARD TO THE RATHER SHARP ENDING OF THE
TOWN AND TO THE BROAD, LOW ROCKY MASSIF THAT SUDDENLY LOOMED BEFORE
THEM.

 

  "THE GROTTO," SAID BORANOVA, "IS LOCATED INSIDE THAT. IT GIVES US ALL
THE ROOM WE WANT, FREES US FROM THE VAGARIES OF WEATHER, AND IS
IMPENETRABLE FROM AERIAL SURVEILLANCE, EVEN FROM SPY SATELLITES."

 

  "SPY SATELLITES ARE ILLEGAL," SAID MORRISON INDIGNANTLY.

 

  "IT IS MERELY ILLEGAL TO CALL THEM SPY SATELLITES," SHOT BACK DEZHNEV.

 

  THE AIR-JET BANKED AS IT MADE A TURN, THEN LANDED IN THE SHADOW OF A
ROCKY CLEFT IN THE BODY OF THE MASSIF.

 

  "ALL OUT," SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  HE MOVED FORWARD, THE OTHER TWO FOLLOWING, AND A DOOR OPENED IN THE
HILLSIDE. MORRISON DIDN'T SEE HOW IT WAS DONE. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A
DOOR; RATHER IT SEEMED AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ROCKY WALL. IT OPENED
JUST AS THE CAVERN OF THE FORTY THIEVES HAD WITH THE UTTERANCE OF THE
WORDS "OPEN SESAME."

 

  DEZHNEV STEPPED TO ONE SIDE AND GESTURED FOR MORRISON AND BORANOVA TO
MOVE INSIDE. MORRISON WENT OUT OF THE BRILLIANT MORNING SUNSHINE INTO A
RATHER DIMLY LIT CHAMBER TO WHICH HIS EYES TOOK HALF A MINUTE TO ADAPT.
IT WAS NO THIEVES' CAVE BUT AN ELABORATELY DETAILED STRUCTURE.

 

  MORRISON FELT AS THOUGH HE HAD STEPPED FROM THE EARTH ONTO THE MOON.
HE HAD NEVER BEEN ON THE MOON, OF COURSE, BUT HE WAS FAMILIAR, AS WAS
VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ON EARTH, WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE UNDERGROUND
LUNAR SETTLEMENTS. THIS HAD PRECISELY THAT OTHER-WORLDLY AIR ABOUT IT
SOMEHOW, EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THAT GRAVITY WAS EARTH-NORMAL.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 4 -- GROTTO

 

  SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL: AN EAGLE MAY AT TIMES GO HUNGRY; A PET CANARY,
NEVER.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  16.

 

  IN A LARGE AND WELL-LIT WASHROOM, BORANOVA AND DEZHNEV BEGAN TO REMOVE
THEIR OUTER CLOTHING. MORRISON, ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT, HESITATED.

 

  BORANOVA SMILED. "YOU MAY KEEP YOUR UNDERCLOTHING ON, DR. MORRISON.
JUST TOSS EVERYTHING ELSE, EXCEPT YOUR SHOES, INTO THAT BIN. I PRESUME
THERE IS NOTHING IN YOUR POCKETS. PLACE YOUR SHOES AT THE BASE OF THE
BIN. BY THE TIME WE LEAVE, IT WILL ALL BE CLEANED AND READY FOR USE."

 

  MORRISON DID AS HE WAS TOLD, TRYING NOT TO OBSERVE THAT BORANOVA HAD A
MOST OPULENT FIGURE, CONCERNING WHICH SHE SEEMED TOTALLY UNAWARE.
AMAZING, HE THOUGHT, WHAT CLOTHES WILL OBSCURE WHEN NOT DESIGNED TO
REVEAL.

 

  THEY WERE WASHING NOW, WITH LAVISH APPLICATION OF SOAP -- FACES TO THE
EARS AND ARMS TO THE ELBOWS -- THEN BRUSHING SAVAGELY AT THEIR HAIR.
AGAIN MORRISON HESITATED AND BORANOVA, READING HIS MIND, SAID, "THE
BRUSHES ARE CLEANED AFTER EACH USE, DR. MORRISON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
MAY HAVE READ OF US, BUT SOME OF US UNDERSTAND HYGIENE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "ALL THIS JUST TO GO INTO THE GROTTO? DO YOU GO THROUGH
THIS EVERY TIME?"

 

  "EVERY TIME. THAT'S WHY NO ONE GOES IN JUST BRIEFLY. AND EVEN WHEN
STAYING WITHIN, THERE ARE FREQUENT ABLATIONS. -- YOU MAY FIND THE NEXT
STEP UNPLEASANT, DR. MORRISON. CLOSE YOUR EYES, TAKE A DEEP BREATH, AND
HOLD IT IF YOU CAN. IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A MINUTE."

 

  MORRISON FOLLOWED ORDERS AND FOUND HIMSELF STRONGLY BUFFETED BY A
SWIRLING WIND. HE STAGGERED DRUNKENLY AND COLLIDED WITH ONE OF THE BINS.
HE HELD ON TIGHTLY. THEN, AS SUDDENLY AS IT STARTED, IT WAS OVER.

 

  HE OPENED HIS EYES. DEZHNEV AND BORANOVA LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY HAD PUT
ON FRIGHT WIGS. HE FELT HIS OWN HAIR AND KNEW HE MUST LOOK THE SAME. HE
REACHED FOR HIS BRUSH.

 

  "DON'T BOTHER," SAID BORANOVA, "THERE'S MORE WE'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH."

 

  "WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?" SAID MORRISON. HE FOUND HE HAD TO CLEAR HIS
THROAT TWICE BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK.

 

  "I MENTIONED THAT WE'D HAVE THE DUST VACUUMED AWAY FROM US, BUT THAT'S
ONLY THE FIRST STAGE OF THE CLEANING PROCESS. -- THROUGH THIS DOOR,
PLEASE." SHE HELD IT OPEN FOR HIM.

 

  MORRISON EMERGED INTO A NARROW BUT WELL-LIT CORRIDOR, THE WALLS
GLOWING PHOTOLUMINESCENTLY. HE LIFTED HIS EYEBROWS. "VERY NICE."

 

  "SAVES ENERGY," DEZHNEV SAID, "AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. -- OR ARE
YOU REFERRING TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT? AMERICANS SEEM TO COME
TO THE SOVIET UNION EXPECTING EVERYTHING TO BE KEROSENE LAMPS." HE
CHUCKLED AND ADDED, "I ADMIT WE HAVEN'T CAUGHT UP WITH YOU IN EVERY
RESPECT. OUR BROTHELS ARE VERY PRIMITIVE COMPARED WITH YOURS."

 

  "YOU STRIKE BACK WITHOUT WAITING TO BE STRUCK," SAID MORRISON. "THAT
IS A SURE SIGN OF AN UNCLEAR CONSCIENCE. IF YOU WERE ANXIOUS TO
DEMONSTRATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, I COULD POINT OUT THAT IT WOULD BE VERY
SIMPLE TO PAVE THE AVENUE GOING FROM MALENKIGRAD TO THE GROTTO AND TO
USE CLOSED AIR-JETS. WE WOULD NEED LESS OF THIS."

 

  DEZHNEV'S FACE DARKENED, BUT BORANOVA PUT IN SHARPLY, "DR. MORRISON IS
QUITE RIGHT, ARKADY. I DON'T LIKE YOUR FEELING THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
TO BE HONEST WITHOUT BEING RUDE. IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTH HONEST AND
POLITE, KEEP YOUR TONGUE ON YOUR OWN SIDE OF YOUR TEETH."

 

  DEZHNEV GRINNED UNEASILY. "WHAT HAVE I SAID? OF COURSE THE AMERICAN
DOCTOR IS RIGHT, BUT IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO WHEN DECISIONS ARE MADE
IN MOSCOW BY IDIOTS WHO SAVE SMALL BITS OF MONEY WITHOUT COUNTING THE
CONSEQUENCES? AS MY OLD FATHER USED TO SAY, 'THE TROUBLE WITH
ECONOMIZING IS THAT IT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE.'"

 

  "THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH," SAID BORANOVA. "WE COULD SAVE A GREAT DEAL OF
MONEY, DR. MORRISON, BY SPENDING ON A BETTER ROAD AND BETTER AIR-JETS,
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO PERSUADE THOSE WHO HOLD THE PURSE STRINGS.
SURELY YOU HAVE THE SAME TROUBLE IN AMERICA."

 

  SHE WAS MOTIONING EVEN AS SHE TALKED AND MORRISON FOLLOWED HER INTO A
SMALL CHAMBER. AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM, DEZHNEV HELD OUT A
BRACELET TO MORRISON. "LET ME TIE THIS AROUND YOUR RIGHT WRIST. WHEN WE
HOLD UP OUR ARMS, YOU HOLD UP YOURS."

 

  MORRISON FELT HIS WEIGHT LIGHTEN MOMENTARILY AS THE CHAMBER FLOOR
DROPPED.

 

  "AN ELEVATOR," HE SAID.

 

  "CLEVER GUESS," SAID DEZHNEV. THEN HE CLAPPED A HAND TO HIS MOUTH AND
SAID IN A MUFFLED TONE, "BUT I MUSTN'T BE RUDE."

 

  THEY STOPPED SMOOTHLY AND THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENED.

 

  "IDENTIFICATION!" CAME A PEREMPTORY VOICE.

 

  DEZHNEV AND BORANOVA RAISED THEIR BANDS, AT WHICH MORRISON DID AS
WELL. UNDER THE PURPLISH LIGHT THAT SUDDENLY SUFFUSED THE ELEVATOR, THE
THREE BRACELETS GLITTERED IN PATTERNS WHICH WERE NOT, MORRISON NOTED,
EXACTLY ALIKE.

 

  THEY WERE USHERED DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR AND INTO A ROOM WHICH WAS BOTH
WARM AND DAMP.

 

  "WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A FINAL SCRUBDOWN, DR. MORRISON," SAID BORANOVA.
"WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THIS AND STRIPPING IS ROUTINE FOR US. IT IS EASIER
-- AND TIMESAVING -- TO DO IT AS A GROUP."

 

  "IF YOU CAN STAND IT," SAID MORRISON GRIMLY, "I CAN."

 

  "IT IS UNIMPORTANT," SAID DEZHNEV. "NONE OF US ARE STRANGERS TO THE
SIGHT."

 

  DEZHNEV SCRAMBLED OUT OF HIS UNDERCLOTHES, STEPPED OVER TO A PORTION
OF THE WALL WHERE A SMALL RED KNOB WAS GLOWING, AND PLACED HIS RIGHT
THUMB IMMEDIATELY ABOVE IT. A NARROW PANEL IN THE WALL SLID OPEN AND
REVEALED WHITE GARMENTS HANGING FLACCIDLY TO ONE SIDE. HE PLACED HIS
UNDERCLOTHES AT THE BOTTOM.

 

  HE SEEMED UTTERLY UNABASHED ABOUT BEING NUDE. HIS CHEST AND SHOULDERS
WERE DARK WITH HAIR AND THERE WAS A LONG-HEALED SCAR ON HIS RIGHT
BUTTOCK. MORRISON WONDERED IDLY HOW THAT MIGHT HAVE COME ABOUT.

 

  BORANOVA DID THE SAME AS DEZHNEV HAD DONE AND SAID, "PICK A LIGHT THAT
IS ON, DR. MORRISON. IT WILL OPEN TO YOUR THUMBPRINT AND THEN, WHEN YOU
TOUCH IT AGAIN, IT WILL CLOSE. AFTER THAT IT WILL OPEN ONLY TO YOUR
THUMBPRINT, SO PLEASE REMEMBER YOUR LOCKER NUMBER AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO
PRESS EVERY LOCKER IN ORDER TO FIND YOUR OWN."

 

  MORRISON DID AS HE WAS TOLD.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IF YOU NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM FIRST, YOU CAN GO
THERE."

 

  "I'M ALL RIGHT," SAID MORRISON.

 

  WITH THAT, THE ROOM WAS ASWIRL WITH A DAMP MIST OF WATER DROPLETS.

 

  "CLOSE YOUR EYES," CALLED OUT BORANOVA, BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY FOR HER
TO SAY SO. THE INITIAL STING OF THE WATER FORCED HIS EYES CLOSED AT
ONCE.

 

  THERE WAS SOAP IN THE WATER OR, AT ANY RATE, SOMETHING THAT STUNG HIS
EYES, TASTED BITTER IN HIS MOUTH, AND IRRITATED HIS NOSTRILS.

 

  "LIFT YOUR ARMS," CALLED OUT DEZHNEV. "YOU NEEDN'T CIRCLE. IT COMES
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS."

 

  MORRISON LIFTED HIS ARMS. HE KNEW IT CAME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. IT CAME
FROM THE FLOOR, TOO, AS HE COULD TELL BY THE SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE
PRESSURE ON HIS SCROTUM.

 

  "HOW LONG DOES THIS LAST?" HE GASPED.

 

  "TOO LONG," SAID DEZHNEV, "BUT IT IS NECESSARY."

 

  MORRISON COUNTED TO HIMSELF. AT THE COUNT OF 58, IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
THE BITTERNESS ON HIS LIPS CEASED. HE SQUINTED HIS EYES. YES, THE OTHER
TWO WERE STILL THERE. HE CONTINUED TO COUNT AND WHEN HE REACHED 126, THE
WATER STOPPED AND HE WAS BATHED IN UNCOMFORTABLY HOT AND DRY AIR.

 

  HE WAS PANTING BY THE TIME THAT STOPPED TOO AND HE REALIZED HE HAD
BEEN HOLDING HIS BREATH.

 

  "WHAT WAS ALL THAT FOR?" HE SAID, LOOKING AWAY UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE
SIGHT OF BORANOVA'S LARGE BUT FIRM BREASTS AND FINDING LITTLE COMFORT IN
DEZHNEV'S HAIRY CHEST.

 

  "WE ARE DRY," SAID BORANOVA. "LET'S GET DRESSED."

 

  MORRISON WAS EAGER BUT WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISAPPOINTED BY THE
NATURE OF THE WHITE CLOTHES IN THE LOCKER. THEY CONSISTED OF A BLOUSE
AND PANTS OF LIGHT COTTON, THE PANTS HELD BY A CORD. THERE WAS ALSO A
LIGHT CAP TO COVER THE HAIR AND LIGHT SANDALS. THOUGH THE COTTON WAS
OPAQUE, IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TRULY LEFT TO
THE IMAGINATION.

 

  HE SAID, "IS THIS ALL WE WEAR?"

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA. "WE WORK IN A CLEAN, QUIET ENVIRONMENT AT EVEN
TEMPERATURE AND, WITH THROWAWAY CLOTHES, WE CAN'T EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY
OF FASHION OR EXPENSE. INDEED, BARRING A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDABLE
RELUCTANCE, WE COULD EASILY WORK IN THE NUDE. BUT ENOUGH -- COME."

 

  AND NOW AT LAST THEY STEPPED INTO WHAT MORRISON RECOGNIZED AT ONCE AS
THE MAIN BODY OF THE GROTTO. IT STRETCHED AWAY BEFORE HIM -- BETWEEN AND
BEYOND ORNATE PILLARS TO A DISTANCE HE COULDN'T MAKE OUT.

 

  HE COULD RECOGNIZE NONE OF THE EQUIPMENT. HOW COULD HE? HE WAS
ENTIRELY A THEORETICIAN AND WHEN HE WORKED IN HIS OWN FIELD, HE USED
COMPUTERIZED DEVICES THAT HE HAD DESIGNED AND MODIFIED HIMSELF. FOR A
MOMENT, HE FELT A STAB OF NOSTALGIA FOR HIS LABORATORY AT THE
UNIVERSITY, FOR HIS BOOKS, FOR THE SMELL OF THE ANIMAL CAGES, EVEN FOR
THE STUPID OBSTINACY OF HIS COLLEAGUES.

 

  THERE WERE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN THE GROTTO. THERE WERE A DOZEN NEARBY
AND OTHERS FARTHER OFF AND THE IMPRESSION WAS OF THE INTERIOR OF A HUMAN
ANT HILL CRAWLING WITH MACHINERY, WITH HUMANITY, WITH PURPOSE.

 

  NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE NEWCOMERS OR TO EACH OTHER. THEY WENT
ABOUT THEIR WORK IN SILENCE, THEIR STEPS MUFFLED BY THEIR SANDALS.

 

  AGAIN BORANOVA SEEMED TO READ MORRISON'S MIND AND WHEN SHE SPOKE IT
WAS IN A WHISPER. "WE KEEP OUR COUNCIL HERE. NONE OF US KNOWS MORE THAN
IT IS GOOD FOR HIM -- OR HER -- TO KNOW. THERE MUST BE NO LEAKS OF
SIGNIFICANCE."

 

  "BUT SURELY THEY MUST COMMUNICATE."

 

  "WHEN THEY MUST, THEY WILL -- MINIMALLY. IT REDUCES THE PLEASURE OF
CAMARADERIE, BUT IT IS NECESSARY."

 

  "THIS KIND OF COMPARTMENTALIZATION SLOWS PROGRESS," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "IT'S THE PRICE WE PAY FOR SECURITY," SAID BORANOVA, "SO IF NO ONE
TALKS TO YOU, IT IS NOT A PERSONAL MATTER. THEY WILL HAVE NO REASON TO
TALK TO YOU."

 

  "THEY'LL BE CURIOUS ABOUT A STRANGER."

 

  "I HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT THEY KNOW YOU ARE AN OUTSIDE EXPERT. THAT IS
ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW."

 

  MORRISON FROWNED. "HOW CAN THEY EXPECT AN AMERICAN TO BE AN OUTSIDE
EXPERT?"

 

  "THEY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE AN AMERICAN."

 

  "MY ACCENT WILL GIVE ME AWAY AT ONCE AS IT DID TO THE SERVING WOMAN."

 

  "BUT YOU WILL NOT TALK TO ANYONE, EXCEPT FOR THOSE TO WHOM I WILL
INTRODUCE YOU."

 

  "AS YOU WISH," SAID MORRISON INDIFFERENTLY.

 

  HE WAS STILL LOOKING AROUND. SINCE HE WAS HERE, HE MIGHT AS WELL LEARN
WHAT HE COULD, EVEN IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE TRIVIAL. WHEN -- IF --
HE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, HE WOULD SURELY BE ASKED FOR EVERY
DETAIL HE HAD OBSERVED AND HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE THEM.

 

  HE SAID IN BORANOVA'S EAR, "THIS MUST BE AN EXPENSIVE PLACE. WHAT
FRACTION OF THE NATIONAL BUDGET IS EXPENDED HERE?"

 

  "IT'S EXPENSIVE," SAID BORANOVA, ADMITTING NOTHING FURTHER, "AND THE
GOVERNMENT LABORS TO LIMIT THE EXPENSE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID SOURLY, "I HAD TO WORK FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING TO
PERSUADE THEM TO ALLOW A SMALL ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT FOR YOUR BENEFIT --
MAY THE COMMITTEE CATCH THE CHOLERA."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "THE CHOLERA NO LONGER EXISTS, EVEN IN INDIA."

 

  "MAY IT BE REINSTATED FOR THE COMMITTEE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ARKADY, IF THESE SUPPOSEDLY HUMOROUS EXPRESSIONS OF
YOURS GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE, IT WILL DO YOU NO GOOD."

 

  "I'M NOT AFRAID OF THOSE PIGS, NATASHA."

 

  "I AM. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IF YOU INFURIATE THEM?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, WITH SUDDEN IMPATIENCE, BUT SPEAKING EVEN MORE SOFTLY,
"WHAT CONCERNS ME IS NEITHER THE COMMITTEE NOR THE BUDGET, BUT THE
SIMPLE QUESTION OF WHAT IT IS I AM DOING HERE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "YOU ARE HERE TO WITNESS A MINIATURIZATION AND TO BE
GIVEN AN EXPLANATION OF WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP. WILL THAT SATISFY YOU,
COMRADE AM-- COMRADE OUTSIDE EXPERT?"

 

  17.

 

  MORRISON FOLLOWED THE OTHER TWO TO SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A SMALL
OLD-FASHIONED TRAIN CARRIAGE ON VERY NARROW-GAUGE TRACKS.

 

  BORANOVA PLACED HER THUMB ON A SMOOTH PATCH AND A DOOR SLID OPEN
SMOOTHLY AND WITHOUT NOISE. "PLEASE GET IN, DR. MORRISON."

 

  MORRISON HELD BACK. "WHERE ARE WE GOING?"

 

  "TO THE MINIATURIZATION CHAMBER, OF COURSE."

 

  "BY RAILROAD? HOW BIG IS THIS PLACE?"

 

  "IT IS LARGE, DOCTOR, BUT NOT SO LARGE. THIS IS A MATTER OF SECURITY.
ONLY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS CAN USE THIS DEVICE AND ONLY BY USING IT CAN
ONE PENETRATE INTO THE CORE OF THE GROTTO."

 

  "ARE YOUR OWN PEOPLE SO UNTRUSTWORTHY?"

 

  "WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX WORLD, DR. MORRISON. OUR PEOPLE ARE TRUSTWORTHY,
BUT WE DO NOT WISH TO SUBJECT LARGE NUMBERS TO TEMPTATIONS THEY NEED NOT
FACE. AND IF SOMEONE PERSUADES ONE OF US TO GO -- ELSEWHERE, AS WE HAVE
PERSUADED YOU, IT IS SAFER IF THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED, YOU SEE. --
PLEASE GET IN."

 

  MORRISON ENTERED THE COMPACT VEHICLE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY. DEZHNEV
FOLLOWED HIM WITH EQUAL TROUBLE, SAYING, "ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SENSELESS
CHEESE PARING. WHY SO SMALL? BECAUSE THE BUREAUCRATS SPEND BILLIONS OF
RUBLES ON A PROJECT AND THEY FEEL VIRTUOUS IF THEY SAVE A FEW HUNDRED IN
ODD PLACES AT THE COST OF MAKING HARDWORKING PEOPLE MISERABLE."

 

  BORANOVA GOT INTO THE FRONT SEAT. MORRISON COULD NOT SEE HOW SHE
MANIPULATED THE CONTROLS OR, FOR THAT MATTER, IF THERE WERE CONTROLS TO
MANIPULATE. IT WAS PROBABLY CONTROLLED BY A COMPUTER. THE CARRIAGE BEGAN
TO MOVE SUDDENLY AND MORRISON FELT THE SLIGHT BACKWARD JAR THAT
RESULTED.

 

  THERE WAS A SMALL WINDOW AT EYE LEVEL ON EITHER SIDE, BUT NOT OF CLEAR
GLASS. MORRISON COULD SEE A SMALL SECTION OF THE CAVERN OUTSIDE IN A
STREAKY, WAVY, POORLY FOCUSED MANNER. APPARENTLY, THE WINDOWS WERE NOT
MEANT FOR VISION, BUT WERE MERELY INTENDED TO REDUCE WHAT MIGHT
OTHERWISE BE AN UNACCEPTABLY TIGHT ENCLOSURE TO THOSE WITH
CLAUSTROPHOBIC TENDENCIES.

 

  IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT THE INDIVIDUALS HE COULD MAKE OUT THROUGH
THE GLASS PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE MOVING CARRIAGE. EVERYONE HERE, HE
THOUGHT, IS WELL-TRAINED. TO SHOW ANY INTEREST IN ANY PROCEDURE WITH
WHICH YOU HAVE NOTHING DIRECTLY TO DO MUST APPARENTLY BE A SIGN OF
DISCOURTESY -- OR WORSE.

 

  IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT THEY WERE APPROACHING THE WALL OF THE
CAVERN AND THE CARRIAGE, WITH ANOTHER SMALL JERK, SLOWED. A SECTION OF
THE WALL SLID ASIDE AND THE CARRIAGE, WITH YET ANOTHER JERK, PICKED UP
SPEED AND MOVED THROUGH THE OPENING.

 

  IT GREW DARK ALMOST AT ONCE AND THE DIM LIGHT IN THE CARRIAGE'S
CEILING DID LITTLE MORE THAN CHANGE NIGHT TO DUSK.

 

  THEY WERE IN A NARROW TUNNEL INTO WHICH THE CARRIAGE FIT WITH
APPARENTLY LITTLE ROOM TO SPARE, EXCEPT ON THE LEFT SIDE WHERE MORRISON,
PEERING PAST DEZHNEV, THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE OUT ANOTHER PAIR OF RAILS.
THERE MUST BE AT LEAST TWO SUCH CARRIAGES, HE THOUGHT, WITH ROOM TO PASS
ONE ANOTHER IN THE TUNNEL IF BOTH WERE IN OPERATION.

 

  THE TUNNEL WAS AS DIMLY LIT AS THE CARRIAGE AND IT WAS NOT STRAIGHT.
EITHER IT HAD BEEN CARVED THROUGH THE HILL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO FOLLOW
LINES OF LEAST RESISTANCE IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY OR IT WAS CURVED
DELIBERATELY IN SOME DIM, ATAVISTIC SEARCH FOR MAKING THINGS MORE SECURE
BY MAKING THEM MORE COMPLICATED. THE DARKNESS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE
CARRIAGE MIGHT SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE.

 

  "HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE -- UH --" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  DEZHNEV LOOKED AT HIM WITH (IN THE DIMNESS) AN UNREADABLE EXPRESSION.
"YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS ME, I SEE. I DO NOT HAVE AN ACADEMIC
TITLE, SO WHY NOT CALL ME ARKADY? EVERYONE DOES HERE AND WHY NOT? MY
FATHER ALWAYS SAID, 'WHAT COUNTS IS THE PERSON, NOT THE NAME.'"

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "VERY WELL. HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE, ARKADY?"

 

  "NOT LONG, ALBERT," SAID DEZHNEV CHEERFULLY -- AND MORRISON, HAVING
BEEN LURED INTO FIRST-NAME INFORMALITY, COULD NOT OBJECT TO THE RETURN.

 

  HE SURPRISED HIMSELF A LITTLE BY FINDING HE DID NOT WISH TO OBJECT.
DEZHNEV, EVEN WITH HIS FATHER'S APHORISMS INCLUDED, SEEMED TO BE
UNCOMPLICATED, AT LEAST, AND, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MORRISON WELCOMED
A CHANCE OF REFRAINING FROM THE PERPETUAL FENCING MATCH TO WHICH
BORANOVA SEEMED TO SUBJECT HIM.

 

  THE CARRIAGE COULD NOT BE MOVING AT A SPEED FASTER THAN A LEISURELY
WALK, BUT THERE WAS A SMALL LURCH EACH TIME IT TOOK A CURVE ON THE
TRACK. APPARENTLY, PETTY ECONOMIES INCLUDED LEAVING THE CURVES UNBANKED.

 

  THEN, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING, LIGHT FLOODED IN AND THE CARRIAGE
GROUND TO A STOP.

 

  MORRISON BLINKED AS HE STEPPED OUT. THE ROOM THEY WERE NOW IN WAS NOT
AS LARGE AS THE ONE THEY HAD LEFT AND THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN IT.
THERE WERE ONLY THE TRACKS UNDER THE CARRIAGE THAT MADE A WIDE ARC AND
THEN LED BACK TOWARD THE SECTION OF THE WALL FROM WHICH THEY HAD
EMERGED. HE COULD SEE ANOTHER SMALL CARRIAGE DISAPPEARING INTO THE
OPENING AND THE WALL CLOSING BEHIND IT. THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH THEY HAD
ARRIVED MADE A SLOW CIRCUIT OF THE ARC AND CAME TO REST NEAR THE WALL.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND. THERE WERE MANY DOORS AND THE CEILING WAS
COMPARATIVELY LOW. WITHOUT DEFINITE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT, HE FELT THAT
HE WAS IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHECKERBOARD, WITH NUMEROUS SMALL ROOMS ON
SEVERAL LEVELS.

 

  BORANOVA WAS WAITING FOR HIM, SEEMING TO OBSERVE HIS CURIOSITY WITH A
TOUCH OF DISAPPROVAL. "ARE YOU READY, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  "NO, DR. BORANOVA," SAID MORRISON. "SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING
OR WHAT I'M DOING, I'M NOT READY. HOWEVER, IF YOU WILL LEAD THE WAY, I
WILL FOLLOW."

 

  "THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY READY. -- THIS WAY, THEN. THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE
YOU MUST MEET."

 

  THEY PASSED THROUGH ONE OF THE DOORS AND INTO ANOTHER SMALL ROOM. THIS
ONE WAS VERY WELL-LIT AND HAD ITS WALLS LINED WITH THICK CABLES.

 

  IN THE ROOM WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO LOOKED UP WHEN THEY CAME IN, PUSHING
ASIDE SOMETHING, THAT SEEMED, FROM ITS APPEARANCE, TO BE SOME KIND OF
TECHNICAL REPORT. SHE WAS QUITE PRETTY IN A PALE AND VULNERABLE WAY. HER
FLAXEN HAIR WAS CUT SHORT BUT WITH ENOUGH OF A WAVE IN IT TO KEEP HER
FROM LOOKING TOO SEVERE. THE SCANTY COTTON UNIFORM SHE WORE, WHICH
MORRISON ALREADY KNEW TO BE UNIVERSAL WITHIN THE GROTTO, SHOWED HER TO
BE ATTRACTIVELY SLIM AND SHAPELY ENOUGH, THOUGH WITHOUT BORANOVA'S
OPULENCE. HER FACE WAS MARRED OR PERHAPS ENHANCED (ACCORDING TO TASTE)
BY A TINY MOLE JUST UNDER THE LEFT CORNER OF HER MOUTH. HER CHEEKBONES
WERE HIGH, HER HANDS THIN-FINGERED AND GRACEFUL, AND HER EXPRESSION DID
NOT APPEAR AS THOUGH SHE WERE MUCH GIVEN TO SMILING.

 

  MORRISON SMILED, HOWEVER. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS KIDNAPPING, IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LIGHTER SIDE TO THIS DISMAL
SITUATION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN UNWILLINGLY PLUNGED.

 

  "GOOD DAY," HE SAID. "IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU." HE TRIED TO GIVE
HIS RUSSIAN AN EDUCATED SOUND AND TO GET RID OF WHAT THE SERVING WOMAN
HAD SO EASILY DETECTED AS HIS AMERICAN ACCENT.

 

  THE YOUNG WOMAN MADE NO DIRECT ANSWER BUT, TURNING TO BORANOVA, SAID
IN A VOICE THAT WAS SLIGHTLY HUSKY, "IS THIS THE AMERICAN?"

 

  "IT IS," SAID BORANOVA. "HE IS DR. ALBERT JONAS MORRISON, PROFESSOR OF
NEUROPHYSICS."

 

  "ASSISTANT PROFESSOR," SAID MORRISON DEPRECATORILY.

 

  BORANOVA IGNORED THE CORRECTION. "AND THIS, DR. MORRISON, IS DR.
SOPHIA KALIININ, WHO IS OUR ELECTROMAGNETICS EXPERT."

 

  "SHE SCARCELY LOOKS OLD ENOUGH," SAID MORRISON GALLANTLY.

 

  THE YOUNG LADY DID NOT SEEM AMUSED. SHE SAID, "I LOOK, PERHAPS,
YOUNGER THAN I AM. I AM THIRTY-ONE YEARS OLD."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED ABASHED AND BORANOVA CUT IN QUICKLY, "COME, WE ARE
READY TO BEGIN. PLEASE CHECK THE CIRCUITS AND SET MATTERS IN MOTION. --
AND QUICKLY."

 

  KALIININ HURRIED OUT.

 

  DEZHNEV LOOKED AFTER HER WITH A GRIN. "I'M GLAD SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO
LIKE AMERICANS. IT CUTS OUT A HUNDRED MILLION POTENTIAL COMPETITORS AT
LEAST. NOW IF SHE ALSO DIDN'T LIKE RUSSIANS AND WOULD COME TO REALIZE
THAT I AM AS KARELO-FINNISH AS SHE IS."

 

  "YOU KARELO-FINNISH?" SAID BORANOVA, FORCED INTO A SMILE. "WHO WOULD
BELIEVE THAT, YOU MADMAN?"

 

  "SHE WOULD -- IF SHE WERE IN THE PROPER MOOD."

 

  "THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN IMPOSSIBLE MOOD." BORANOVA TURNED TO MORRISON.
"PLEASE DO NOT TAKE SOPHIA'S BEHAVIOR PERSONALLY, DR. MORRISON. MANY OF
OUR CITIZENS PASS THROUGH AN ULTRAPATRIOTIC PHASE AND FEEL IT TO BE VERY
SOVIET TO DISLIKE AMERICANS. IT IS MORE POSE THAN REALITY. FRN SURE,
ONCE WE BEGIN TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM, THAT SOPHIA WILL LET DOWN HER
BARRIERS."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY. THINGS ARE SIMILAR IN MY COUNTRY. AS A
MATTER OF FACT, AT THE MOMENT, I'M NOT VERY FOND OF SOVIETS -- AND
UNDERSTANDABLY, I THINK. BUT" -- AND HE SMILED -- "I COULD MAKE AN
EXCEPTION FOR DR. KALIININ VERY EASILY."

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "AMERICAN LIKE YOU OR RUSSIAN LIKE ARKADY,
THERE IS A PECULIAR MASCULINE WAY OF THOUGHT THAT TRANSCENDS NATIONAL
BOUNDARIES AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES."

 

  MORRISON WAS UNMOVED. "NOT THAT I WILL BE WORKING WITH HER -- OR WITH
ANYONE. I HAVE GROWN TIRED OF TELLING YOU, DR. BORANOVA, THAT I DON'T
ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF MINIATURIZATION AND THAT I CANNOT AND WILL NOT
BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU IN ANY WAY."

 

  DEZHNEV LAUGHED. "YOU KNOW, ONE COULD ALMOST BELIEVE ALBERT. HE SPEAKS
SO SERIOUSLY."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "OBSERVE, DR. MORRISON. THIS IS KATINKA."

 

  SHE TAPPED A CAGE WHICH MORRISON, STARTLED, NOW OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST
TIME. DR. KAHININ HAD RATHER ABSORBED HIS ATTENTION TILL NOW AND EVEN
AFTER SHE HAD LEFT HE HAD BEEN IDLY KEEPING HIS EYE ON THE DOOR THROUGH
WHICH SHE HAD GONE, WAITING FOR HER REAPPEARANCE.

 

  HE FOCUSED ON THE CAGE OF WIRE MESH. KATINKA WAS, APPARENTLY, A WHITE
RABBIT OF MODERATE SIZE AND PLACID APPEARANCE, WHO WAS MUNCHING AWAY AT
GREENERY WITH THE RAPT CONCENTRATION OF HER KIND.

 

  MORRISON WAS AWARE OF THE SLIGHT SCRABBLING NOISE SHE MADE AND OF THE
RABBIT ODOR, WHICH HE MUST HAVE NOTED, UNCONSCIOUSLY, EARLIER AND
IGNORED.

 

  HE SAID, "YES, I SEE HER. A RABBIT."

 

  "NOT JUST A RABBIT, DOCTOR. SHE IS A MOST UNUSUAL CREATURE. UNIQUE.
SHE HAS MADE HISTORY TO A FAR GREATER EXTENT THAN HAS THE CATALOG OF WAR
AND DISASTER THAT USUALLY IS THOUGHT OF BY THAT NAME. IF WE EXCLUDE SUCH
PURELY INCIDENTAL CREATURES AS WORMS, FLEAS, AND SUBMICROSCOPIC
PARASITES, KATINKA IS THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE THAT HAS BEEN
MINIATURIZED. IN FACT, SHE HAS BEEN MINIATURIZED ON THREE SEPARATE
OCCASIONS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN MINIATURIZED DOZENS OF TIMES MORE IF WE
HAD BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SHE HAS CONTRIBUTED ENORMOUSLY TO OUR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINIATURIZATION OF LIFE FORMS AND, AS YOU CAN SEE, HER
EXPERIENCES HAVE IN NO WAY ADVERSELY AFFECTED HER."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I DO NOT WISH TO BE INSULTING, BUT YOUR BARE STATEMENT
THAT THE RABBIT HAS BEEN MINIATURIZED THREE TIMES IS NOT REALLY EVIDENCE
THAT THIS HAS INDEED HAPPENED. I DO NOT MEAN TO CAST DOUBT UPON YOUR
INTEGRITY, BUT, IN A CASE LIKE THIS, I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING
LESS THAN WITNESSING THE FACT IS SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCING."

 

  "CERTAINLY. AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON' THAT -- AT CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE
-- KATINKA WILL NOW BE MINIATURIZED A FOURTH TIME."

 

  118.

 

  SOPHIA KALIININ SWIRLED BACK IN AND TURNED TO MORRISON. "ARE YOU
WEARING A WATCH OR DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING METALLIC ON YOU?" SHE ASKED
CRISPLY.

 

  "I HAVE NO POSSESSIONS ON ME AT ALL, DR. KALIININ. NOTHING BUT THE
CLOTHES I WEAR, THE SINGLE POCKET OF WHICH IS EMPTY. EVEN THIS
IDENTIFICATION BRACELET THAT HAS BEEN PUT ON ME SEEMS TO BE OF PLASTIC."

 

  "IT IS MERELY THAT THERE IS A STRONG ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AND METAL
WOULD INTERFERE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS?"

 

  "NONE. OR AT LEAST NONE HAVE YET BEEN DETECTED."

 

  MORRISON, WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR PRETENSE OF
MINIATURIZATION AND WONDERING HOW LONG THEY COULD CARRY ON THE FRAUD (HE
WAS GROWING MORE CENSORIOUS OVER THE MATTER BY THE MINUTE), SAID, WITH
JUST A TOUCH OF MALICE, "MIGHT NOT OVEREXPOSURE LEAD TO BIRTH DEFECTS
SHOULD YOU EVER GET PREGNANT, DR. KALIININ?"

 

  KALIININ FLUSHED. "I HAVE A BABY. SHE IS PERFECTLY NORMAL."

 

  "WERE YOU EXPOSED DURING PREGNANCY?"

 

  "ONCE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IS THE INQUISITION OVER, DR. MORRISON? MAY WE BEGIN?"

 

  "YOU STILL MAINTAIN THAT YOU WILL MINIATURIZE THE RABBIT?"

 

  "CERTAINLY."

 

  "THEN GO AHEAD. I'M ALL EYES."

 

  (HOW FOOLISH OF THEM, HE THOUGHT SARDONICALLY. THEY WOULD SOON BE
CLAIMING, OF COURSE, THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG, BUT WHERE WOULD THEY
GO FROM THERE? WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT?)

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "TO BEGIN WITH, DR. MORRISON, WOULD YOU LIFT THE CAGE?"

 

  MORRISON MADE NO MOVE TO DO SO. HE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE
THREE SOVIETS IN SUSPICION AND UNCERTAINTY.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "GO AHEAD. IT WON'T HURT, ALBERT. YOU WON'T EVEN GET
YOUR HANDS DIRTY AND, AFTER ALL, HANDS WERE MEANT TO BECOME DIRTY AT
WORK."

 

  MORRISON PUT HIS HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CAGE AND LIFTED. IT
WEIGHED ABOUT TEN KILOGRAMS, HE JUDGED. HE GRUNTED AND SAID, "MAY I PUT
IT DOWN NOW?"

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "GENTLY," SAID KALIININ. "DO NOT DISTURB KATINKA."

 

  MORRISON LOWERED IT CAREFULLY. THE RABBIT, WHICH HAD MOMENTARILY
STOPPED FEEDING WHEN THE CAGE WAS LIFTED, SNIFFED THE AIR CURIOUSLY AND
RETURNED TENTATIVELY TO ITS UNHURRIED CHEWING.

 

  BORANOVA NODDED AND SOPHIA MOVED TO ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE A BANK
OF CONTROLS WERE ALL BUT HIDDEN BY THE CABLES. SHE LOOKED OVER HER
SHOULDER AT THE CAGE AS THOUGH ESTIMATING ITS POSITION, THEN WALKED OVER
TO MOVE IT SLIGHTLY. SHE RETURNED TO THE CONTROLS AND CLOSED A SWITCH.

 

  A WHINING SOUND MADE ITSELF HEARD AND THE CAGE BEGAN TO GLITTER AND
SHIMMER AS THOUGH SOMETHING, ALL BUT INVISIBLE, HAD INTERPOSED ITSELF
BETWEEN IT AND THEMSELVES. THE SHIMMER EXTENDED BENEATH THE CAGE,
SEPARATING IT FROM THE STONE-TOP TABLE ON WHICH IT HAD BEEN RESTING.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THE CAGE IS NOW ENCLOSED IN THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD.
ONLY THE OBJECTS WITHIN THE FIELD WILL BE MINIATURIZED."

 

  MORRISON STARED AND A LITTLE WORM OF UNCERTAINTY BEGAN TO STIR WITHIN
HIM. WERE THEY GOING TO TRY SOME CLEVER ILLUSION ON HIM AND MAKE HIM
THINK HE HAD WITNESSED MINIATURIZATION? HE SAID, "AND HOW EXACTLY DID
YOU PRODUCE THAT SO-CALLED MINIATURIZATION FIELD?"

 

  "THAT," SAID BORANOVA, "WE DO NOT INTEND TO TELL YOU. I THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS. GO AHEAD, SOPHIA."

 

  THE WHINE HEIGHTENED IN PITCH AND INTENSIFIED SOMEWHAT. MORRISON FOUND
IT UNPLEASANT, BUT THE OTHERS SEEMED TO ENDURE IT STOLIDLY. IN LOOKING
AT THEM, HE HAD TAKEN HIS EYES OFF THE CAGE. NOW WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT
AGAIN, IT SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN SMALLER.

 

  HE FROWNED AND BENT HIS HEAD SO AS TO LINE UP ONE SIDE OF THE CAGE
WITH THE VERTICAL LINE OF A CABLE ON THE OPPOSITE WALL. HE HELD HIS HEAD
STEADY, BUT THE SIDE OF THE CAGE SHRANK AWAY FROM THE REFERENCE LINE.
THERE WAS NO MISTAKE, THE CAGE WAS DISTINCTLY SMALLER. HE BLINKED HIS
EYES IN FRUSTRATION.

 

  BORANOVA SMILED NARROWLY. "IT IS INDEED SHRINKING, DR. MORRISON.
SURELY YOUR EYES TELL YOU SO."

 

  THE WHINE CONTINUED -- THE SHRINKING CONTINUED. THE CAGE WAS PERHAPS
HALF ITS ORIGINAL LINEAR MEASUREMENT.

 

  MORRISON SAID, WITH OBVIOUS LACK OF CONVICTION, "THERE ARE SUCH THINGS
AS OPTICAL ILLUSIONS."

 

  BORANOVA CALLED OUT. "SOPHIA, STOP THE PROCESS FOR A MOMENT."

 

  THE WHINE LOWERED INTO SILENCE AND THE GLITTER OF THE MINIATURIZATION
FIELD DIMMED AND DIED. THE CAGE SAT ON THE TABLE AS BEFORE, A
CONSIDERABLY SMALLER VERSION THAN IT HAD BEEN. INSIDE WAS THE RABBIT
STILL -- A SMALLER RABBIT, BUT ONE THAT WAS PROPORTIONED IN EVERY WAY AS
THE ORIGINAL HAD BEEN, MUNCHING ON SMALLER LEAVES, WITH SMALLER PIECES
OF CARROT DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE FLOOR OF THE CAGE.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION?"

 

  MORRISON WAS SILENT AND DEZHNEV SAID, "COME, ALBERT, ACCEPT THE
EVIDENCE OF YOUR SENSES. THIS EXPERIMENT CONSUMED CONSIDERABLE ENERGY
AND IF YOU REMAIN UNCONVINCED, OUR CLEVER ADMINISTRATORS WILL BE ANNOYED
WITH ALL OF US FOR WASTING MONEY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, THEN?"

 

  AND MORRISON, SHAKING HIS HEAD IN RUEFUL CONFUSION, SAID, "I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WOULD YOU LIFT THE CAGE AGAIN, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  AGAIN MORRISON HESITATED AND BORANOVA SAID, "THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD
HAS NOT LEFT IT RADIOACTIVE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THE TOUCH OF YOUR
UNMINIATURIZED HAND WILL NOT AFFECT IT, NOR WILL ITS STATE OF
MINIATURIZATION AFFECT YOU. YOU SEE?" AND SHE PLACED HER HAND, FLATLY
AND GENTLY, ON TOP OF THE CAGE.

 

  MORRISON'S HESITATION WAS NOT PROOF AGAINST THAT. GINGERLY, HE PLACED
HIS HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CAGE AND LIFTED. HE EXCLAIMED IN
SURPRISE, FOR IT COULD NOT BE MUCH OVER A KILOGRAM IN MASS. THE CAGE
TREMBLED IN HIS GRIP AND THE MINIATURIZED RABBIT, ALARMED, HOPPED TO ONE
CORNER OF THE CAGE AND HUDDLED THERE IN AGITATION.

 

  MORRISON PUT THE CAGE DOWN AND, AS NEARLY AS HE COULD ESTIMATE, DID SO
IN ITS ORIGINAL POSITION, BUT KALIININ WALKED OVER AND MADE A SMALL
ADJUSTMENT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK, DR. MORRISON?"

 

  "IT WEIGHS CONSIDERABLY LESS. IS THERE SOME WAY YOU PULLED A SWITCH?"

 

  "PULLED A SWITCH? YOU MEAN REPLACED THE LARGER OBJECT WITH A SMALLER
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING, THE SMALLER EXACTLY LIKE THE LARGER IN
EVERYTHING BUT SIZE. DR. MORRISON, PLEASE."

 

  MORRISON CLEARED HIS THROAT AND DIDN'T PRESS THE POINT. IT LACKED
PLAUSIBILITY EVEN TO HIMSELF.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "PLEASE NOTICE, DR. MORRISON, THAT NOT ONLY HAS THE
SIZE BEEN DECREASED, BUT THE MASS IN PROPORTION. THE VERY ATOMS AND
MOLECULES OF WHICH THE CAGE AND ITS CONTENTS ARE COMPOSED HAVE SHRUNK IN
SIZE AND MASS. FUNDAMENTALLY, PLANCK'S CONSTANT HAS DECREASED, SO THAT
NOTHING INSIDE HAS CHANGED RELATIVE TO ITS OWN PARTS. TO THE RABBIT,
ITSELF, ITS FOOD, AND EVERYTHING WITHIN THE CAGE SEEMS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAS INCREASED IN SIZE RELATIVE TO THE RABBIT, BUT, OF
COURSE, IT REMAINS UNAWARE OF THAT."

 

  "BUT THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD IS GONE. WHY DON'T THE CAGE AND ITS
CONTENTS REVERT TO ORDINARY SIZE?"

 

  "FOR TWO REASONS, DR. MORRISON. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE MINIATURIZED
STATE IS METASTABLE. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERIES
THAT MAKE MINIATURIZATION POSSIBLE. AT WHATEVER POINT WE STOP IN THE
PROCESS, IT TAKES VERY LITTLE ENERGY TO MAINTAIN IT IN THAT STATE. AND
SECONDLY, THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD IS NOT ENTIRELY GONE. IT IS MERELY
MINIMIZED AND DRAWN INWARD SO THAT IT STILL KEEPS THE ATMOSPHERE WITHIN
THE CAGE FROM DIFFUSING OUTWARD AND NORMAL MOLECULES OUTSIDE FROM
DIFFUSING INWARD. IT ALSO LEAVES THE WALLS OF THE CAGE TOUCHABLE BY
UNMINIATURIZED HANDS. -- BUT WE ARE NOT FINISHED, DR. MORRISON. SHALL WE
CONTINUE?"

 

  MORRISON, TROUBLED AND UNABLE TO DENY THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE, WONDERED
FOR A MOMENT IF HE HAD SOMEHOW BEEN DRUGGED INTO A KIND OF
SUPER-SUGGESTIBILITY THAT WOULD MAKE HIM EXPERIENCE WHATEVER HE WAS TOLD
HE WAS EXPERIENCING. IN A CHOKED WAY, HE SAID, "YOU ARE TELLING ME A
GREAT DEAL."

 

  "YES, WE ARE, BUT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY. IF YOU REPEAT THIS IN AMERICA,
YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE BELIEVED AND NOTHING YOU SAY WILL GIVE THE
SLIGHTEST HINT AS TO THE CORE OF THE MINIATURIZATION TECHNIQUE."
BORANOVA LIFTED HER HAND AND KALIININ AGAIN THREW THE SWITCH.

 

  THE WHINE RETURNED AND THE CAGE BEGAN ONCE AGAIN TO SHRINK. IT SEEMED
TO BE GOING FASTER NOW AND BORANOVA, AS THOUGH READING MORRISON'S MIND,
SAID, "THE FURTHER IT SHRINKS, THE LESS MASS THERE IS TO REMOVE AND THE
MORE RAPIDLY IT SHRINKS FURTHER."

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF STARING, IN A STATE OF NEAR-SHOCK, AT A CAGE
THAT WAS A CENTIMETER ACROSS AND STILL SHRINKING.

 

  BUT BORANOVA RAISED HER HAND AGAIN AND THE WHINE DIED.

 

  "BE CAREFUL, DR. MORRISON. IT WEIGHS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS NOW
AND IT IS A FRAGILE OBJECT INDEED TO ANYONE ON OUR SCALE. HERE. TRY
THIS."

 

  SHE HANDED HIM A LARGE MAGNIFYING GLASS. MORRISON, WITHOUT SAYING A
WORD, TOOK IT AND HELD IT OVER THE TINY CAGE. HE MIGHT NOT HAVE MANAGED
TO MAKE OUT WHAT THE MOVING OBJECT WITHIN IT WAS IF HE HAD COME UPON IT
WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, FOR HIS MIND WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH AN
INCREDIBLY TINY RABBIT.

 

  HE HAD SEEN IT SHRINK, HOWEVER, AND HE STARED AT IT NOW WITH A MIXTURE
OF CONFUSION AND FASCINATION.

 

  HE LOOKED UP AT BORANOVA AND SAID, "IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?"

 

  "DO YOU STILL SUSPECT AN OPTICAL ILLUSION OR HYPNOTISM OR -- WHAT
ELSE?"

 

  "DRUGS?"

 

  "IF IT WERE DRUGS, DR. MORRISON, IT WOULD BE A GREATER ACHIEVEMENT
THAN MINIATURIZATION. LOOK AROUND YOU. DOESN'T EVERYTHING ELSE LOOK
NORMAL? IT WOULD BE AN UNUSUAL DRUG INDEED THAT WOULD ALTER YOUR SENSE
PERCEPTION OF A SINGLE OBJECT IN A LARGE ROOM OF UNCHANGED MISCELLANY.
COME, DOCTOR, WHAT YOU'VE WITNESSED IS REAL."

 

  "MAKE IT LARGER," SAID MORRISON BREATHLESSLY.

 

  DEZHNEV LAUGHED AND SUPPRESSED IN A QUICK CHOKE. "IF I LAUGH, THE WIND
MAY WELL BLOW AWAY KATINKA, WHEREUPON NATASHA AND SOPHIA WILL BOTH
STRIKE ME WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS ROOM. IF YOU WISH IT ENLARGED,
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DEZHNEV IS RIGHT. YOU SEE, DR. MORRISON, YOU HAVE
WITNESSED A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION, NOT MAGIC. IF IT WERE MAGIC, I
COULD SNAP MY FINGER AND THE RABBIT WOULD BE ITS NORMAL SELF AGAIN IN A
NORMAL CAGE -- AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW YOU WERE WITNESSING AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION. HOWEVER, IT TAKES CONSIDERABLE ENERGY TO DECREASE PLANCK'S
CONSTANT TO A TINY FRACTION OF ITS NORMAL VALUE, EVEN OVER A RELATIVELY
SMALL VOLUME OF THE UNIVERSE, WHICH IS WHY MINIATURIZATION IS SO
EXPENSIVE A TECHNIQUE. TO ENLARGE PLANCK'S CONSTANT ONCE AGAIN MUST
RESULT IN THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY EQUAL TO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN CONSUMED
ORIGINALLY, FOR THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY HOLDS EVEN IN THE
PROCESS OF MINIATURIZATION. WE CANNOT DEMINIATURIZE THEN ANY FASTER THAN
WE CAN DISPOSE OF THE HEAT PRODUCED, SO THAT IT TAKES CONSIDERABLE TIME
TO DO IT -- MUCH MORE THAN IT TOOK TO MINIATURIZE."

 

  FOR A WHILE, MORRISON WAS SILENT. HE FOUND THE EXPLANATION INVOLVING
CONSERVATION OF ENERGY MORE CONVINCING THAN THE DEMONSTRATION ITSELF.
CHARLATANS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO METICULOUS ABOUT OBEYING THE
CONSTRAINTS OF PHYSICS.

 

  HE SAID, "IT SEEMS TO ME, THEN, THAT YOUR MINIATURIZATION PROCESS CAN
SCARCELY BE A PRACTICAL DEVICE. AT MOST IT WOULD ONLY SERVE AS A TOOL,
PERHAPS, TO BROADEN AND EXPAND QUANTUM THEORY."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "EVEN THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH, BUT DON'T JUDGE A TECHNIQUE
BY ITS INITIAL PHASE. WE CAN HOPE THAT WE WILL LEARN HOW TO CIRCUMVENT
THESE LARGE ENERGY CHANGES, HOW TO FIND METHODS OF MINIATURIZATION AND
DEMINIATURIZATION THAT WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT. DOES ALL THE
ENERGY-CHANGE HAVE TO PASS FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS INTO
MINIATURIZATION AND THEN INTO HEAT ON DEMINIATURIZATION? MIGHT NOT
DEMINIATURIZATION BE SOMEHOW INVEIGLED INTO RELEASING ENERGY AS
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AGAIN. THAT WOULD BE EASIER TO HANDLE, PERHAPS."

 

  "HAVE YOU REPEALED THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS?" ASKED MORRISON
WITH EXAGGERATED POLITENESS.

 

  "NOT AT ALL. WE DON'T EXPECT AN IMPOSSIBLE 100 PERCENT CONVERSION. IF
WE CAN CONVERT 75 PERCENT OF THE DERNINIATURIZATION ENERGY INTO AN
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD -- OR EVEN ONLY 25 PERCENT -- THAT WOULD BE AN
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE PRESENT SITUATION. HOWEVER, THERE IS HOPE OF A
TECHNIQUE EVEN MORE SUBTLE AND FAR MORE EFFICIENT AND THAT IS WHERE YOU
COME IN."

 

  MORRISON'S EYES WIDENED. "I? I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS. WHY PICK ME
OUT FOR YOUR SALVATION? YOU WOULD HAVE DONE AS WELL WITH A CHILD OUT OF
KINDERGARTEN."

 

  "NOT SO. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. COME, DR. MORRISON, YOU AND I
SHALL GO TO MY OFFICE WHILE SOPHIA AND ARKADY BEGIN THE TEDIOUS PROCESS
OF RESTORING KATINKA. I WILL THERE SHOW YOU THAT YOU KNOW QUITE ENOUGH
TO HELP US MAKE MINIATURIZATION EFFICIENT AND THEREFORE A COMMERCIALLY
PRACTICAL VENTURE. IN FACT, YOU WILL SEE QUITE CLEARLY THAT YOU ARE THE
ONLY PERSON WHO CAN HELP US."

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 5 -- COMA

 

  LIFE IS PLEASANT DEATH IS PEACEFUL. IT IS THE TRANSITION THAT IS
TROUBLESOME.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  19.

 

  "THIS," SAID NATALYA BORANOVA, "IS MY OWN PORTION OF THE GROTTO."

 

  SHE SAT DOWN IN A RATHER BATTERED ARMCHAIR THAT (MORRISON IMAGINED)
SHE FOUND PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE, HAVING MOLDED IT TO HER BODY OVER THE
YEARS.

 

  HE SAT DOWN IN ANOTHER CHAIR, SMALLER AND MORE AUSTERE, WITH A
SATIN-COVERED SEAT THAT WAS LESS COMFORTABLE THAN IT LOOKED. HE GLANCED
OVER THE SURROUNDINGS WITH A SHARP SENSATION OF HOMESICKNESS. THERE WERE
WAYS IN WHICH IT REMINDED HIM OF HIS OWN OFFICE. THERE WAS THE COMPUTER
OUTLET AND THE LARGE SCREEN. (BORANOVA'S WAS FAR MORE ORNATE THAN HIS
OWN -- THE SOVIET STYLE TENDED TOWARD THE CURLICUE AND MORRISON FELT A
MOMENTARY CURIOSITY AS TO THE REASON AND THEN PUT THAT ASIDE AS A
TRIVIAL MATTER.)

 

  THERE WAS ALSO THE SAME TREND TOWARD DISORDER IN THE PILES OF
PRINTOUTS, THE SAME DISTINCT ODOR THEY GAVE RISE TO, THE SAME OCCASIONAL
OLD-FASHIONED BOOK IN AMONG THE FILM CASSETTES. MORRISON TRIED TO READ
THE TITLE OF ONE THAT WAS TOO FAR OFF AND TOO WORN TO BE MADE OUT.
(BOOKS ALWAYS HAD AN ANCIENT APPEARANCE, EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW.) HE
HAD THE IMPRESSION IT WAS AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BOOK, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE
SURPRISED HIM. HE HIMSELF HAD SEVERAL RUSSIAN CLASSICS IN HIS LABORATORY
FOR AN OCCASIONAL BRUSHUP OF THE LANGUAGE.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE ARE QUITE PRIVATE HERE. WE WILL NOT BE OVERHEARD
AND WE WILL NOT BE DISTURBED. LATER WE CAN HAVE LUNCH BROUGHT IN."

 

  "YOU ARE KIND," SAID MORRISON, TRYING NOT TO SOUND SARDONIC.

 

  BORANOVA SEEMED TO TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE. "NOT AT ALL. AND NOW, DR.
MORRISON, I CAN'T HELP HAVING NOTICED THAT ARKADY IS ON A FIRST-NAME
BASIS WITH YOU. HE IS, OF COURSE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AN UNCULTURED
INDIVIDUAL AND IS APT TO PRESUME. STILL, MAY I ASK AGAIN IF, DESPITE THE
CONDITIONS THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE, WE MIGHT BE PLEASANT AND INFORMAL WITH
EACH OTHER?"

 

  MORRISON HESITATED. "WELL, CALL ME ALBERT, THEN. BUT IT WILL BE MERELY
A CONVENIENCE AND NO SIGN OF FRIENDSHIP. I AM NOT LIKELY TO DISMISS MY
KIDNAPPING."

 

  BORANOVA CLEARED HER THROAT. "I DID TRY TO PERSUADE YOU TO COME OF
YOUR OWN FREE WILL. IF NECESSITY HAD NOT DRIVEN US SO HARD, WE WOULD
HAVE GONE NO FARTHER THAN THAT."

 

  "IF YOU ARE EMBARRASSED BY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, THEN RETURN ME TO THE
UNITED STATES. SEND ME BACK NOW AND I WILL BE WILLING TO FORGET THIS
EPISODE AND WILL MAKE NO COMPLAINT TO MY GOVERNMENT."

 

  SLOWLY BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "YOU KNOW THAT CANNOT BE DONE.
NECESSITY STILL DRIVES. YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN, SHORTLY. BUT
MEANWHILE, ALBERT, LET US TALK TOGETHER, WITHOUT NONSENSE, AS PART OF
THE GLOBAL FAMILY OF SCIENCE THAT RISES SUPERIOR TO QUESTIONS OF
NATIONALITY AND OTHER ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS AMONG HUMAN BEINGS. --
SURELY BY NOW YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE REALITY OF MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "I MUST ACCEPT IT." MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD, ALMOST REGRETFULLY.

 

  "AND YOU SEE OUR PROBLEM?"

 

  "YES. IT IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE IN ENERGY."

 

  "IMAGINE, HOWEVER, IF WE LOWER THE ENERGY COST DRASTICALLY. IMAGINE IF
WE CAN BRING ABOUT MINIATURIZATION BY PLUGGING A WIRE INTO A WALL SOCKET
AND CONSUMING NO MORE ENERGY THAN WE WOULD IF WE WERE HEATING A TOASTER
OVEN."

 

  "OF COURSE -- BUT APPARENTLY IT CAN'T BE DONE. OR, AT ANY RATE, YOUR
PEOPLE CANNOT DO IT. WHY ALL THE SECRECY, THEN? WHY NOT PUBLISH THE
FINDINGS YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE AND WELCOME THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE REST
OF THE FAMILY OF SCIENCE? SECRECY SEEMS TO IMPLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT
THE SOVIET UNION IS PLANNING TO USE MINIATURIZATION AS A WEAPON OF SOME
KIND, ONE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUR COUNTRY TO FIND
IT FEASIBLE TO BREAK THE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THAT HAS LED TO PEACE AND
COOPERATION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR THE LAST TWO GENERATIONS."

 

  "THAT IS NOT SO. THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT TRYING TO ESTABLISH A WORLD
HEGEMONY."

 

  "I HOPE NOT. STILL, IF THE SOVIET UNION SEEKS SECRECY, IT IS
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT OTHER UNITS OF THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE WOULD BEGIN TO
WONDER IF IT SEEKS CONQUEST."

 

  "THE UNITED STATES HAS ITS SECRETS, HAS IT NOT?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CONFIDE IN ME. IF IT
DOES HAVE SECRETS -- AND ACTUALLY I SUPPOSE IT DOES -- I DISAPPROVE OF
THAT, TOO. BUT TELL ME WHY THERE IS ANY NECESSITY FOR SECRETS? WHAT DOES
IT MATTER IF YOU DEVELOP MINIATURIZATION, OR WE, OR BOTH OF US IN
COMBINATION -- OR THE AFRICANS, FOR THAT MATTER? WE AMERICANS INVENTED
THE AIRPLANE AND THE TELEPHONE, BUT YOU HAVE BOTH. WE WERE THE FIRST TO
REACH THE MOON, BUT YOU ENJOY YOUR FULL SHARE OF THE LUNAR SETTLEMENTS.
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE THE FIRST TO CRACK THE PROBLEM OF FUSION
POWER AND THE FIRST TO BUILD A SOLAR POWER STATION IN SPACE AND WE
PARTICIPATE FULLY IN BOTH."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALL THAT YOU SAY IS TRUE. NEVERTHELESS, FOR OVER A
CENTURY, THE WORLD HAS TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY IS
SUPERIOR TO SOVIET TECHNOLOGY. THAT IS A CONSTANT IRRITANT TO US, AND
IF, IN SOMETHING AS BASIC AND AS THOROUGHLY REVOLUTIONARY AS
MINIATURIZATION, IT IS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE SOVIET UNION LED THE
WAY, THEN THAT WOULD BE MOST DESIRABLE FOR US."

 

  "AND THE GLOBAL FAMILY OF SCIENCE THAT YOU APPEAL TO? ARE YOU A MEMBER
OF THAT OR ARE YOU MERELY A SOVIET SCIENTIST?"

 

  "I AM BOTH," SAID BORANOVA WITH A TOUCH OF ANGER. "IF IT WERE MY
DECISION, THEN PERHAPS I WOULD OPEN OUR DISCOVERIES TO THE WORLD.
HOWEVER, I DO NOT MAKE THE DECISION. MY GOVERNMENT DOES AND I OWE THEM
LOYALTY. NOR DO YOU AMERICANS MAKE IT EASY FOR US TO DO OTHERWISE. YOUR
CONSTANT LOUD AMERICAN ASSUMPTION OF SUPERIORITY DRIVES US INTO A
DEFENSIVE POSTURE."

 

  "BUT WON'T IT SPOIL SOVIET PRIDE IN THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT TO HAVE TO
CALL UPON AN AMERICAN SUCH AS MYSELF TO HELP OUT?"

 

  "WELL, YES, IT DOES SOUR THE MILK A BIT, BUT IT WILL AT LEAST GIVE THE
UNITED STATES A SHARE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT, WHICH WE SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE,
ALBERT. YOU WILL BE SHOWING YOURSELF A TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT AND WILL
IMPROVE YOUR OWN REPUTATION IF YOU HELP US."

 

  MORRISON SMILED BITTERLY. "A BRIBE?"

 

  BORANOVA SHRUGGED. "IF THAT IS HOW YOU INTERPRET IT, I CANNOT STOP
YOU. BUT LET US TALK IN A FRIENDLY MANNER AND SEE WHAT WILL COME OF IT."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, START BY GIVING ME SOME INFORMATION. NOW THAT I AM
FORCED TO BELIEVE THAT MINIATURIZATION IS POSSIBLE, CAN YOU TELL ME THE
BASIC PHYSICS BEHIND IT? I AM CURIOUS."

 

  "YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT, ALBERT. IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR YOU TO
LEARN TOO MUCH. HOW WOULD WE, THEN, BE ABLE TO LET YOU GO BACK TO YOUR
COUNTRY? -- BESIDES, ALTHOUGH I CAN OPERATE THE MINIATURIZATION SYSTEM,
EVEN I DON'T KNOW THE BASICS. IF I DID, OUR GOVERNMENT COULD SCARCELY
RISK HAVING ME VISIT THE UNITED STATES."

 

  "YOU MEAN WE MIGHT KIDNAP YOU AS YOU KIDNAPPED ME. DO YOU THINK THE
UNITED STATES ENGAGES IN KIDNAPPING?"

 

  "I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IT WOULD WHEN NECESSITY DROVE SUFFICIENTLY."

 

  "AND WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW THE BASICS OF MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "THAT ALSO IS NOT SOMETHING THAT, IN GENERAL, IT IS SAFE FOR YOU TO
KNOW. HOWEVER, I CAN LIFT THE CURTAIN JUST A BIT IN THIS MATTER. PYOTOR
SHAPIROV IS ONE OF THEM."

 

  "CRAZY PETER," SAID MORRISON, SMILING. "SOMEHOW I'M NOT SURPRISED."

 

  "YOU SHOULDN'T BE. I AM SURE YOU SAY 'CRAZY' ONLY AS ONE OF YOUR
JOKES, BUT IT WAS HE WHO FIRST WORKED OUT THE BASIC RATIONALE BEHIND
MINIATURIZATION. OF COURSE," SHE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY, "IT MAY VERY WELL
BE THAT THAT REQUIRED A CERTAIN INSANITY -- OR, AT ANY RATE, A CERTAIN
IDIOSYNCRACY OF THOUGHT. IT IS ALSO SHAPIROV WHO FIRST SUGGESTED A
METHOD OF ACHIEVING MINIATURIZATION WITH A MINIMUM EXPENDITURE OF
ENERGY."

 

  "HOW? THE CONVERSION OF DERNINIATURIZATION INTO AN ELECTROMAGNETIC
FIELD?"

 

  BORANOVA MADE A FACE. "I WAS MERELY GIVING YOU AN EXAMPLE. SHAPIROV'S
METHOD IS FAR MORE SUBTLE."

 

  "CAN IT BE EXPLAINED?"

 

  "ONLY ROUGHLY. SHAPIROV POINTS OUT THAT THE TWO GREAT ASPECTS OF THE
UNIFIED THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE -- THE QUANTUM ASPECT AND THE
RELATIVISTIC ASPECT -- EACH DEPENDS ON A CONSTANT THAT SETS A LIMIT. IN
QUANTUM THEORY IT IS PLANCK'S CONSTANT, WHICH IS VERY TINY BUT NOT ZERO.
IN RELATIVITY, IT IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT, WHICH IS VERY GREAT BUT NOT
INFINITE. PLANCK'S CONSTANT SETS A LOWER LIMIT TO THE SIZE OF ENERGY
TRANSFER AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT SETS AN UPPER LIMIT TO THE SPEED OF
INFORMATION TRANSMISSION. SHAPIROV MAINTAINS, FURTHERMORE, THAT THE TWO
ARE RELATED. IN OTHER WORDS, IF PLANCK'S CONSTANT IS DECREASED, THE
SPEED OF LIGHT WOULD INCREASE. IF PLANCK'S CONSTANT WERE REDUCED TO
ZERO, THEN THE SPEED OF LIGHT WOULD BE INFINITE."

 

  MORRISON SAID AT ONCE, "IN WHICH CASE, THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE NEWTONIAN
IN ITS PROPERTIES."

 

  BORANOVA NODDED. "YES. ACCORDING TO SHAPIROV, THEN, THE REASON FOR THE
ENORMOUS ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF MINIATURIZATION IS THAT THE TWO LIMITS
ARE UNCOUPLED, THAT PLANCK'S CONSTANT IS DECREASED WITHOUT THE SPEED OF
LIGHT BEING INCREASED. IF THE TWO WERE COUPLED, THEN ENERGY WOULD FLOW
FROM THE SPEED-OF-LIGHT LIMIT INTO THE PLANCK'S CONSTANT LIMIT DURING
MINIATURIZATION AND IN THE OTHER DIRECTION DURING DEMINIATURIZATION, SO
THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WOULD GO UP AS MINIATURIZATION PROCEEDED AND
DOWN AGAIN DURING DEMINIATURIZATION. THE EFFICIENCY SHOULD BE NEARLY A
HUNDRED PERCENT. VERY LITTLE ENERGY WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO
MINIATURIZE AND RE-EXPANSION COULD TAKE PLACE VERY QUICKLY."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "DOES SHAPIROV KNOW HOW MINIATURIZATION AND
DEMINIATURIZATION CAN BE CARRIED THROUGH WITH THE TWO LIMITS COUPLED?"

 

  "HE SAID HE DID."

 

  "SAID? PAST TENSE? DOES THAT MEAN HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND?"

 

  "NOT EXACTLY."

 

  "THEN WHAT HAS HE DONE?"

 

  BORANOVA HESITATED. "ALBERT," SHE SAID ALMOST PLEADINGLY, "DO NOT GO
TOO FAST. I WANT YOU TO THINK. YOU KNOW THAT MINIATURIZATION WORKS. YOU
KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT PRACTICAL. YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE A
BOON FOR HUMANITY AND I HAVE ASSURED YOU THAT IT IS NOT MEANT FOR
DESTRUCTIVE OR WARLIKE USE. ONCE WE KNOW THAT OUR NATIONAL PRECEDENCE IS
RECOGNIZED, WHICH WE WANT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS I HAVE PRESENTED TO
YOU QUITE FRANKLY, I AM SURE WE WILL SHARE MINIATURIZATION WITH ALL
DIVISIONS OF THE GLOBE."

 

  "REALLY, NATALYA? WOULD YOU AND YOUR NATION TRUST THE UNITED STATES IF
THE SITUATION WERE REVERSED?"

 

  "TRUST!" SAID BORANOVA AND SIGHED HEAVILY. "IT DOESN'T COME NATURALLY
TO ANYONE. IT IS THE WEAKNESS OF HUMANITY THAT WE CONSTANTLY READ THE
WORST INTO OTHERS. YET TRUST MUST BEGIN SOMEWHERE OR THE FRAGILE MOOD OF
COOPERATION WE HAVE ENJOYED FOR SO LONG WILL SHATTER AND WE WILL BE BACK
TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL ITS HORRORS. SINCE THE UNITED STATES
FEELS SO STRONGLY THAT IT IS THE STRONGER AND MORE ADVANCED NATION,
SHOULD IT NOT BE THE FIRST TO RISK THE ACT OF TRUSTING?"

 

  MORRISON SPREAD OUT HIS ARMS. "I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. I AM A PRIVATE
CITIZEN AND DO NOT REPRESENT MY NATION."

 

  "AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN YOU CAN HELP US, KNOWING THAT YOU WILL NOT BE
HARMING YOUR OWN COUNTRY."

 

  "I CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW SUCH A THING, SINCE I ONLY HAVE YOUR WORD FOR
IT AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU REPRESENT YOUR NATION ANY MORE THAN I
REPRESENT MINE. BUT ALL THIS IS IRRELEVANT, NATALYA. EVEN IF I WANTED
TO, HOW ON EARTH CAN I HELP YOU MAKE MINIATURIZATION PRACTICAL, WHEN I
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT?"

 

  "BE PATIENT. IN A WHILE WE WILL HAVE LUNCH. DEZHNEV AND KALIININ WILL
BE THROUGH WITH THE DEMINIATURIZATION OF KATINKA BY THEN AND WILL JOIN
US, TOGETHER WITH ONE OTHER WHOM YOU MUST MEET. THEN, AFTER LUNCH, I
WILL TAKE YOU TO SEE SHAPIROV."

 

  "I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, NATALYA. YOU TOLD ME JUST A WHILE AGO THAT
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR ME TO MEET ANYONE WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD
MINIATURIZATION. I MIGHT LEARN TOO MUCH AND THIS MIGHT RAISE PROBLEMS
WITH MY RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES. WHY, THEN, SHOULD I RISK SEEING
SHAPIROV?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID SADLY, "SHAPIROV IS AN EXCEPTION. I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU
WILL UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN YOU SEE HIM -- AND YOU WILL ALSO UNDERSTAND
WHY WE MUST TURN TO YOU."

 

  "THAT," SAID MORRISON WITH ALL THE CONVICTION WITH WHICH HE HAD LATELY
PROCLAIMED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MINIATURIZATION, "I WILL NEVER
UNDERSTAND."

 

  20.

 

  LUNCH WAS IN A WELL-LIT ROOM, FOR STRIPS OF THE WALLS, TOGETHER WITH
THE ENTIRE CEILING, WERE ELECTROLUMINESCENT. BORANOVA HAD POINTED IT OUT
WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE AND MORRISON HAD REFRAINED FROM MAKING INVIDIOUS
COMPARISONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, WHERE ELECTROLUMINESCENCE WAS
WIDESPREAD.

 

  NOR DID HE EXPRESS HIS AMUSEMENT OVER THE FACT THAT DESPITE THE
ELECTROLUMINESCENCE THERE WAS A SMALL BUT ORNATE CHANDELIER CENTERED IN
THE CEILING. ITS BULBS CONTRIBUTED NOTHING TO THE LIGHT, BUT IT
UNDOUBTEDLY MADE THE ROOM SEEM LESS ANTISEPTIC.

 

  AS BORANOVA HAD PREDICTED, A FIFTH PERSON HAD JOINED THEM AND MORRISON
WAS INTRODUCED TO SOMEONE NAMED YURI KONEV. "A NEUROPHYSICIST LIKE
YOURSELF, ALBERT," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  KONEV, WHO WAS DARKLY HANDSOME AND WHO SEEMED TO BE IN HIS MIDDLE
THIRTIES, HAD AN AIR OF ALMOST GAWKY YOUTH ABOUT HIMSELF. HE SHOOK HANDS
WITH WARY CURIOSITY AND SAID, "I AM MOST PLEASED TO MEET YOU," IN
CREDITABLE ENGLISH, SPOKEN WITH A DISTINCT AMERICAN ACCENT.

 

  "YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, I IMAGINE," SAID MORRISON, ALSO
IN ENGLISH.

 

  "I SPENT TWO YEARS DOING GRADUATE WORK AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY. IT GAVE
ME A SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE MY ENGLISH."

 

  "NEVERTHELESS," SAID BORANOVA IN RUSSIAN, "DR. ALBERT MORRISON DOES
VERY WELL IN OUR LANGUAGE, YURI, AND WE MUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO
PRACTICE IT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY."

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID KONEV IN RUSSIAN.

 

  MORRISON HAD, INDEED, ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT HE WAS UNDERGROUND. THERE
WERE NO WINDOWS IN THE ROOM, BUT THAT WAS COMMON ENOUGH IN LARGE OFFICE
BUILDINGS EVEN ABOVEGROUND.

 

  THE MEAL WAS NOT AN EBULLIENT ONE. ARKADY DEZHNEV ATE WITH SILENT
CONCENTRATION AND SOPHIA KALIININ SEEMED ABSTRACTED. SHE GLANCED
OCCASIONALLY AT MORRISON, BUT IGNORED KONEV COMPLETELY. BORANOVA WATCHED
EVERYONE, BUT SAID VERY LITTLE. SHE SEEMED CONTENT TO LEAVE THE FLOOR TO
KONEV.

 

  KONEV SAID, "DR. MORRISON, I MUST TELL YOU THAT I HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR
WORK CAREFULLY."

 

  MORRISON, WHO HAD BEEN EATING THE THICK CABBAGE SOUP APPRECIATIVELY,
LOOKED UP WITH A QUICK SMILE. THIS WAS THE FIRST REFERENCE TO HIS WORK,
RATHER THAN TO THEIR WORK, SINCE HE HAD ARRIVED IN THE SOVIET UNION.

 

  "THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST, BUT NATALYA AND ARKADY CALL ME ALBERT
AND I WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RESPONDING TO DIFFERENT NAMES. LET US ALL
BE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS FOR THE BRIEF TIME THAT REMAINS BEFORE I AM
RETURNED TO MY OWN LAND."

 

  "HELP US," SAID BORANOVA IN A LOW VOICE, "AND IT WILL INDEED BE A
BRIEF TIME."

 

  "NO CONDITIONS," SAID MORRISON IN AN EQUALLY LOW TONE. "I WISH TO
LEAVE."

 

  KONEV RAISED HIS VOICE, AS THOUGH TO FORCE THE CONVERSATION BACK INTO
THE TRACK HE HAD CHOSEN. "BUT I MUST ADMIT, ALBERT, THAT I HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO DUPLICATE YOUR OBSERVATIONS."

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TIGHTENED. "I HAVE HAD THIS COMPLAINT FROM
NEUROPHYSICISTS IN THE UNITED STATES."

 

  "NOW, WHY SHOULD THIS BE? ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV IS GREATLY INTRIGUED BY
YOUR THEORIES AND MAINTAINS THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY CORRECT, AT LEAST IN
PART."

 

  "AH, BUT SHAPIROV ISN'T A NEUROPHYSICIST, IS HE?"

 

  "NO, HE'S NOT, BUT HE HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FEEL FOR WHAT IS CORRECT. I
HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO SAY, 'IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS MUST BE RIGHT,'
IN WHICH WHATEVER HE IS DISCUSSING HASN'T PROVED TO BE RIGHT -- AT LEAST
IN PART. HE SAYS YOU ARE PROBABLY ON THE ROAD TO ESTABLISHING AN
INTERESTING RELAY STATION."

 

  "A RELAY STATION? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT."

 

  "IT'S WHAT HE SAID ONCE IN MY HEARING. SOME PRIVATE THOUGHT OF HIS
OWN, NO DOUBT." HE CAST A PENETRATING GLANCE AT MORRISON, AS THOUGH
WAITING FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REMARK.

 

  MORRISON SIMPLY SHRUGGED IT AWAY. "WHAT I HAVE DONE," HE SAID, "IS TO
ESTABLISH A NEW KIND OF ANALYSIS OF THE CEPHALIC WAVES ORIGINATING IN
THE BRAIN AND TO HAVE NARROWED THE SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC NETWORK WITHIN
THE BRAIN DEVOTED TO CREATIVE THOUGHT."

 

  "THERE YOU MAY BE A LITTLE OVEROPTIMISTIC, ALBERT. I HAVE NOT
SATISFIED MYSELF THAT THIS NETWORK OF YOURS REALLY EXISTS."

 

  "MY RESULTS MARK IT OUT QUITE CLEARLY."

 

  "IN DOGS AND MONKEYS. IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW FAR WE CAN EXTRAPOLATE SUCH
INFORMATION TO THE MUCH MORE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN."

 

  "I ADMIT I HAVEN'T WORKED WITH THE HUMAN BRAIN ANATOMICALLY, BUT I
HAVE ANALYZED HUMAN BRAIN WAVES CAREFULLY AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AT LEAST
CONSISTENT WITH MY CREATIVE STRUCTURE HYPOTHESIS."

 

  "THIS IS WHAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE AND WHAT AMERICAN
RESEARCHERS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE, EITHER."

 

  AGAIN MORRISON SHRUGGED. "ADEQUATE BRAIN WAVE ANALYSIS IS, AT BEST, A
MONUMENTALLY DIFFICULT THING AT THE QUINTENARY LEVEL AND NO ONE ELSE HAS
GIVEN THE YEARS TO THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE."

 

  "OR POSSESSES THE PARTICULAR COMPUTERIZED EQUIPMENT. YOU HAVE DESIGNED
YOUR OWN PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRAIN WAVE ANALYSIS, HAVEN'T YOU?"

 

  "YES, I HAVE."

 

  "AND DESCRIBED IT IN THE LITERATURE?"

 

  "CERTAINLY. IF I ACHIEVED RESULTS WITH AN UNDESCRIBED PROGRAM, THEY
WOULD BE WORTH NOTHING. WHO COULD CONFIRM MY RESULTS, LACKING AN
EQUIVALENT COMPUTER PROGRAM?"

 

  "YET I HAVE HEARD, AT THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPHYSICAL CONFERENCE IN
BRUSSELS LAST YEAR, THAT YOU ARE CONTINUALLY MODIFYING YOUR PROGRAM AND
COMPLAINING THAT THE LACK OF CONFIRMATION STEMS FROM THE USE OF
INSUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX PROGRAMMING INCAPABLE OF FOURIER ANALYSIS TO THE
PROPER DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY."

 

  "NO, YURI, THAT IS FALSE. ENTIRELY FALSE. I HAVE MODIFIED MY PROGRAM
FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT I HAVE CAREFULLY DESCRIBED EACH MODIFICATION IN
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE TRIED TO PUBLISH THE DATA IN THE AMERICAN
JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSICS, BUT THEY HAVEN'T ACCEPTED MY PAPERS THESE LAST
FEW YEARS. IF OTHERS CONFINE THEIR READING TO THE AJN AND DON'T KEEP UP
WITH RELEVANT LITERATURE ELSEWHERE, THAT IS NOT MY FAULT."

 

  "AND YET --" KONEV PAUSED AND FROWNED IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE UNCERTAIN
THOUGHT. "I DON'T KNOW IF I OUGHT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE IT MAY BE
SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL ANTAGONIZE YOU."

 

  "GO AHEAD. I HAVE, IN THESE LAST FEW YEARS, LEARNED TO ACCEPT ALL
KINDS OF REMARKS-HOSTILE, SARCASTIC, AND -- WORST OF ALL -- PITYING. I
AM QUITE HARDENED TO IT. -- THIS IS GOOD CHICKEN KIEV, BY THE WAY."

 

  "THIS IS A GUEST MEAL," MURMURED KALIININ, ALMOST UNDER HER BREATH.
"TOO BUTTERY -- BAD FOR THE FIGURE."

 

  "HAH," SAID DEZHNEV LOUDLY. "BAD FOR THE FIGURE. THAT IS AN AMERICAN
REMARK THAT MAKES NO SENSE IN RUSSIAN. MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID, 'THE BODY
KNOWS WHAT IT NEEDS. THAT'S WHY SOME THINGS TASTE GOOD.'"

 

  KALIININ CLOSED HER EYES IN QUITE OBVIOUS DISTASTE. "A RECIPE FOR
SUICIDE," SHE SAID.

 

  MORRISON NOTICED THAT KONEV DID NOT LOOK AT THE YOUNG WOMAN DURING
THIS BIT OF BYPLAY. NOT AT ALL.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU WERE SAYING, YURI? ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT ANTAGONIZE
ME, YOU THOUGHT?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "WELL, THEN, IS IT TRUE, ALBERT, OR NOT TRUE THAT YOU
ACTUALLY GAVE YOUR PROGRAM TO A COLLEAGUE AND THAT, USING IT IN YOUR
COMPUTER, HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO DUPLICATE YOUR RESULTS?"

 

  "THAT'S TRUE," SAID MORRISON. "AT LEAST MY COLLEAGUE, AN ABLE ENOUGH
MAN, SAID HE COULD NOT DUPLICATE MY RESULTS."

 

  "DO YOU SUSPECT HE WAS LYING?"

 

  "NO. NOT REALLY. IT'S JUST THAT THE OBSERVATIONS ARE SO DELICATE THAT
TO ATTEMPT THEM WHILE CERTAIN OF FAILURE MAY WELL LEAD, IT SEEMS TO ME,
TO FAILURE."

 

  "MIGHT ONE NOT ARGUE THE OTHER WAY AROUND, ALBERT, AND SAY THAT YOUR
CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS LEADS YOU TO IMAGINE SUCCESS?"

 

  "POSSIBLY," SAID MORRISON. "THAT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME SEVERAL
TIMES IN THE PAST. BUT I DON'T THINK SO."

 

  "ONE MORE RUMOR," SAID KONEV. "THIS I TRULY HATE TO REPEAT, BUT IT
SEEMS SO IMPORTANT. IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE CLAIMED THAT IN YOUR
ANALYSIS OF BRAIN WAVES YOU HAVE OCCASIONALLY SENSED ACTUAL THOUGHTS?"

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD VIGOROUSLY. "I HAVE NEVER MADE SUCH A CLAIM IN
PRINT. I HAVE SAID TO A COLLEAGUE, ONCE OR TWICE, THAT IN CONCENTRATING
ON THE BRAIN WAVE ANALYSIS THERE ARE OCCASIONALLY TIMES WHEN I SEEM TO
FIND THOUGHTS INVADING MY MIND. I HAVE NO WAY OF TELLING WHETHER THE
THOUGHTS ARE ENTIRELY MINE OR WHETHER MY OWN BRAIN WAVES RESONATE TO
THOSE OF THE SUBJECT."

 

  "IS SUCH A RESONANCE CONCEIVABLE?"

 

  "I SUPPOSE SO. THE BRAIN WAVES PRODUCE TINY FLUCTUATING
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS."

 

  "AH! IT IS THIS, I SUPPOSE, THAT MADE ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV MAKE THAT
REMARK ABOUT A RELAY STATION. BRAIN WAVES ARE ALWAYS PRODUCING
FLUCTUATING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS -- WITH OR WITHOUT ANALYSIS. YOU
DON'T RESONATE -- IF RESONANCE IS WHAT IT IS -- TO THE THOUGHTS OF
SOMEONE IN YOUR PRESENCE, NO MATTER HOW INTENSELY HE MAY BE THINKING.
THE RESONANCE TAKES PLACE ONLY WHEN YOU ARE BUSILY STUDYING THE BRAIN
WAVES WITH YOUR PROGRAMMED COMPUTER. IT PRESUMABLY ACTS AS A RELAY
STATION, MAGNIFYING OR INTENSIFYING THE BRAIN WAVES OF THE SUBJECT AND
PROJECTING THEM INTO YOUR MIND."

 

  "I HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL FUGITIVE
IMPRESSION. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH."

 

  "IT MIGHT BE. THE HUMAN BRAIN IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN ANY OTHER
EQUIVALENT PIECE OF MATTER WE KNOW OF."

 

  "WHAT ABOUT DOLPHINS?" SAID DEZHNEV, HIS MOUTH FULL.

 

  "AN EXPLODED VIEW," SAID KONEV AT ONCE. "THEY'RE INTELLIGENT, BUT
THEIR BRAINS ARE DEVOTED TOO ENTIRELY TO THE MINUTIAE OF SWIMMING TO
ALLOW ENOUGH ROOM FOR ABSTRACT THOUGHT ON THE HUMAN SCALE."

 

  "I HAVE NEVER STUDIED DOLPHINS," SAID MORRISON INDIFFERENTLY.

 

  "IGNORE THE DOLPHINS," SAID KONEV IMPATIENTLY. "JUST CONCENTRATE ON
THE FACT THAT YOUR COMPUTER, PROPERLY PROGRAMMED, MAY ACT AS A RELAY
STATION, PASSING THOUGHTS FROM THE MIND OF THE SUBJECT YOU ARE STUDYING
TO YOUR OWN MIND. IF THAT IS SO, ALBERT, WE NEED YOU AND NO OTHER PERSON
IN THE WORLD."

 

  MORRISON SAID, FROWNING AND PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY FROM THE TABLE,
"EVEN IF I CAN PICK UP THOUGHTS BY WAY OF MY COMPUTER -- A CLAIM I HAVE
NEVER MADE AND WHICH, IN FACT, I DENY -- WHAT CAN THAT POSSIBLY HAVE TO
DO WITH MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  BORANOVA ROSE AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH. "IT IS TIME," SHE SAID. "LET US
GO AND SEE SHAPIROV NOW."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHAT HE SAYS WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME."

 

  "YOU WILL FIND," SAID BORANOVA WITH A HINT OF STEEL IN HER VOICE,
"THAT HE WILL SAY NOTHING -- BUT WILL BE UTTERLY CONVINCING JUST THE
SAME."

 

  21.

 

  MORRISON HAD KEPT HIS TEMPER WELL SO FAR. THE SOVIETS WERE, AFTER ALL,
TREATING HIM AS A GUEST AND IF HE COULD OVERLOOK THE SMALL MATTER OF HIS
BEING CARRIED OFF BY FORCE, HE HAD LITTLE OF WHICH TO COMPLAIN.

 

  BUT WHAT WERE THEY GETTING AT? ONE BY ONE, BORANOVA HAD INTRODUCED HIM
TO OTHERS -- FIRST DEZHNEV, THEN KALIININ, THEN KONEV -- FOR REASONS HE
HAD NOT PENETRATED. OVER AND OVER, BORANOVA HAD HINTED OF HIS USEFULNESS
WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING WHAT IT MIGHT BE. NOW KONEV TALKED OF IT AND WAS
EQUALLY UNCOMMUNICATIVE.

 

  AND NOW THEY WERE TO SEE SHAPIROV. CLEARLY THIS HAD TO BE A CLIMAX OF
SORTS. FROM THE FIRST MENTION OF HIM BY BORANOVA AT THE CONVENTION TWO
DAYS AGO, SHAPIROV HAD SEEMED TO HOVER OVER THE WHOLE MATTER LIKE A
THICKENING FOG. IT WAS HE WHO HAD WORKED OUT THE MINIATURIZATION
PROCESS, HE WHO SEEMED TO DETECT A CONNECTION BETWEEN PLANCK'S CONSTANT
AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT, HE WHO SEEMED TO VALUE MORRISON'S NEUROPHYSICAL
THEORIES, AND HE WHO MADE THE REMARK ABOUT THE COMPUTER AS RELAY STATION
THAT HAD APPARENTLY SET OFF KONEV'S CONVICTION THAT MORRISON -- AND ONLY
MORRISON -- COULD HELP THEM.

 

  IT REMAINED FOR MORRISON, NOW, TO RESIST ANY BLANDISHMENTS OR
ARGUMENTS THAT SHAPIROV COULD PRESENT. IF MORRISON INSISTED THAT HE
WOULD NOT HELP THEM, WHAT WOULD THEY DO WHEN ALL THE BLANDISHMENTS AND
ARGUMENTS HAD FAILED?

 

  CRUDE THREAT OF FORCE -- OR TORTURE?

 

  BRAINWASHING?

 

  MORRISON QUAILED. HE DARED NOT PUT HIS REFUSAL ON THE BASIS THAT HE
WOULD NOT. HE WOULD HAVE TO PERSUADE THEM THAT HE COULD NOT. SURELY THAT
WAS A REASONABLE POSITION ON WHICH TO TAKE HIS STAND. WHAT COULD
NEUROPHYSICS -- AND A DUBIOUS, UNACCEPTED BIT OF NEUROPHYSICAL WORK AT
THAT -- HAVE TO DO WITH MINIATURIZATION?

 

  BUT WHY DIDN'T THEY SEE THAT FOR THEMSELVES? WHY DID THEY ALL ACT AS
THOUGH IT WERE CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERSON LIKE HIMSELF, WHO HAD NEVER AS
MUCH AS THOUGHT OF MINIATURIZATION UNTIL SOME FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BEFORE,
COULD DO SOMETHING FOR THEM -- THEM, THE ONLY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD --
THAT THEY COULD NOT DO FOR THEMSELVES?

 

  IT WAS A RATHER LENGTHY WALK ALONG CORRIDORS AND, LOST IN HIS OWN
UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS, MORRISON DID NOT NOTICE THAT THEY WERE FEWER IN
NUMBER THAN HE HAD THOUGHT.

 

  HE SAID TO BORANOVA SUDDENLY, "WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?"

 

  SHE SAID, "THEY HAVE WORK TO DO. WE DO NOT HAVE FOREVER TO DO WHAT WE
MUST, YOU KNOW."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. CHATTY, THEY WERE NOT. NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO
SCATTER INFORMATION. ALWAYS CLOSE-LIPPED. A LONG-STANDING SOVIET HABIT,
PERHAPS -- OR SOMETHING THAT WAS GROUND INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WORK ON
A SECRET PROJECT IN WHICH EVEN THE SCIENTISTS DARED NOT STEP OUTSIDE THE
NARROW LIMITS OF THEIR IMMEDIATE WORK.

 

  WERE THEY COMING TO HIM AS A STORYBOOK AMERICAN GENERALIST? NOTHING HE
HAD EVER DONE, SURELY, WOULD GIVE ANYONE THAT IMPRESSION. AS A MATTER OF
FACT, HE WAS HIMSELF A NARROW SPECIALIST, KNOWING VIRTUALLY NOTHING
OUTSIDE OF NEUROPHYSICS. -- THIS WAS A WORSENING DISEASE OF MODERN
SCIENCE, HE THOUGHT.

 

  THEY HAD ENTERED ANOTHER ELEVATOR, SOMETHING HE HAD SCARCELY BOTHERED
TO NOTICE, AND THEY WERE NOW ON ANOTHER LEVEL. HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND
RECOGNIZED CHARACTERISTICS THAT SEEMED TO TRANSCEND NATIONAL
DIFFERENCES.

 

  "ARE WE IN A MEDICAL WING?" HE ASKED.

 

  "A HOSPITAL," SAID BORANOVA. "THE GROTTO IS A SELF-CONTAINED
SCIENTIFIC COMPLEX."

 

  "AND WHY ARE WE HERE? AM I --" HE STOPPED SUDDENLY, AS THE HORROR OF
THE THOUGHT SMOTE HIM. WAS HE TO BE DRUGGED OR, BY SOME OTHER MEDICAL
MEANS, MADE MORE COMPLIANT?

 

  BORANOVA HAD WALKED ON FOR A MOMENT, THEN STOPPED, LOOKED BACK, AND
CAME TOWARD HIM, SAYING SNAPPISHLY, "NOW WHAT IS FRIGHTENING YOU?"

 

  MORRISON FELT ASHAMED. WERE HIS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT TRANSPARENT?
"NOTHING IS FRIGHTENING ME," HE GRUMBLED. "I AM SIMPLY TIRED OF WALKING
AIMLESSLY."

 

  "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE ARE WALKING AIMLESSLY? I SAID WE WERE GOING
TO SEE PYOTOR SHAPIROV. WE ARE WALKING TOWARD HIM NOW. -- COME, WE HAVE
ONLY A FEW STEPS LEFT."

 

  THEY TURNED A CORNER AND BORANOVA BECKONED HIM TO A WINDOW.

 

  HE STEPPED TO HER SIDE AND LOOKED IN. IT WAS A ROOM AND THERE WERE A
NUMBER OF PEOPLE PRESENT. THERE WERE FOUR BEDS, BUT ONLY ONE WAS
OCCUPIED AND IT WAS SURROUNDED BY EQUIPMENT THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE.
THERE WERE TUBES AND GLASSWARE EXTENDING TOWARD THE BED AND MORRISON
COUNTED A DOZEN FUNCTIONARIES, WHO MIGHT BE DOCTORS, NURSES, OR MEDICAL
TECHNICIANS.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THERE IS ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV."

 

  "WHICH ONE?" SAID MORRISON, HIS EYES TRAVELING FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES
TO THE OTHER AND FINDING NO ONE WHO SEEMED SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO THE
SCIENTIST HE RECALLED HAVING MET ONCE.

 

  "IN THE BED."

 

  "IN THE BED? HE'S ILL, THEN?"

 

  "WORSE THAN ILL. HE IS IN A COMA. HE HAS BEEN IN A COMA FOR OVER A
MONTH AND WE STRONGLY SUSPECT IT IS AN IRREVERSIBLE STATE."

 

  "I'M TERRIBLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT. I PRESUME THAT IS WHY YOU REFERRED
TO HIM IN THE PAST TENSE BEFORE LUNCH."

 

  "YES, THE SHAPIROV WE KNOW IS IN THE PAST TENSE, UNLESS --"

 

  "UNLESS HE RECOVERS? BUT YOU JUST SAID THE COMA IS PROBABLY
IRREVERSIBLE."

 

  "THAT'S TRUE. BUT NEITHER IS HE BRAIN-DEAD. THE BRAIN IS DAMAGED
CERTAINLY OR HE WOULDN'T BE IN A COMA, BUT IT IS NOT DEAD AND KONEV, WHO
HAS FOLLOWED YOUR WORK CLOSELY, THINKS THAT SOME OF HIS THINKING NETWORK
IS STILL INTACT."

 

  "AH," SAID MORRISON, THE LIGHT BREAKING. "I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. WHY
DIDN'T YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO BEGIN WITH? IF YOU HAD WANTED TO CONSULT ME
ON SUCH A MATTER AND HAD EXPLAINED, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO COME
HERE WITH YOU VOLUNTARILY. YET, ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I WERE TO STUDY
HIS CEREBRAL FUNCTIONING AND TELL YOU, 'YES, YURI KONEV IS RIGHT,' THEN
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO YOU?"

 

  "THAT WILL DO US NO GOOD AT ALL. YOU DON'T YET BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND,
YOU SEE, AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I WANT UNTIL YOU
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM. DO YOU QUITE REALIZE WHAT IS BURIED THERE IN THE
STILL-LIVING PORTIONS OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN?"

 

  "HIS THOUGHTS, I SUPPOSE."

 

  "SPECIFICALLY, HIS THOUGHTS OF THE INTERCONNECTION OF PLANCK'S
CONSTANT AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT. HIS THOUGHTS OF A METHOD FOR MAKING
MINIATURIZATION AND DEMINIATURIZATION RAPID, LOW-ENERGY, AND PRACTICAL.
WITH THOSE THOUGHTS, WE GIVE HUMANITY A TECHNIQUE THAT WILL
REVOLUTIONIZE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY -- AND SOCIETY -- MORE THAN
ANYTHING SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE TRANSISTOR. PERHAPS MORE THAN
ANYTHING SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF FIRE. WHO CAN TELL?"

 

  "ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT BEING OVERDRAMATIC?"

 

  "NO, ALBERT. DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT IF MINIATURIZATION CAN BE TIED
IN WITH A VAST ACCELERATION OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT, A SPACESHIP, IF
SUFFICIENTLY MINIATURIZED, CAN BE SENT TO ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE AT
MANY TIMES THE ORDINARY SPEED OF LIGHT. WE WON'T NEED FASTER-THAN-LIGHT
TRAVEL. LIGHT WILL TRAVEL FAST ENOUGH FOR US. AND WE WON'T NEED
ANTIGRAVITY, FOR A MINIATURIZED SHIP WILL HAVE CLOSE TO ZERO MASS."

 

  "I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THAT."

 

  "YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "I DON'T MEAN I CAN'T BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF MINIATURIZATION. I MEAN I
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IS PERMANENTLY LOCKED IN
THE BRAIN OF ONE MAN. OTHERS WILL EVENTUALLY THINK OF IT. IF NOT NOW,
THEN NEXT YEAR OR NEXT DECADE."

 

  "IT'S EASY TO WAIT WHEN YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED, ALBERT. THE TROUBLE IS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A NEXT DECADE OR EVEN A NEXT YEAR. THIS GROTTO
WHICH YOU SEE ALL ABOUT YOU HAS COST THE SOVIET UNION AS MUCH AS A MINOR
WAR. EACH TIME WE MINIATURIZE ANYTHING -- EVEN IF IT'S JUST KATINKA --
WE CONSUME ENOUGH ENERGY TO LAST A SIZABLE TOWN FOR A WHOLE DAY.
ALREADY, OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS LOOK ASKANCE AT THIS EXPENSE AND MANY
SCIENTISTS, WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF MINIATURIZATION OR
WHO ARE SIMPLY SELFISH, COMPLAIN THAT ALL OF SOVIET SCIENCE IS BEING
STARVED FOR THE SAKE OF THE GROTTO. IF WE DO NOT COME UP WITH A DEVICE
TO SAVE ON ENERGY -- AN EXTREME SAVING, TOO -- THIS PLACE WILL BE SHUT
DOWN."

 

  "NEVERTHELESS, NATALYA, IF YOU PUBLISH WHAT IS NOW KNOWN OF
MINIATURIZATION AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE GLOBAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE
ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, THEN INNUMERABLE SCIENTISTS WILL PUT THEIR MINDS
TO IT AND QUICKLY ENOUGH SOMEONE WILL DEVISE A METHOD FOR COUPLING
PLANCK'S CONSTANT AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT."

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA, "AND PERHAPS THE SCIENTIST WHO WILL OBTAIN THE
KEY OF LOW-ENERGY MINIATURIZATION WILL BE AN AMERICAN OR A FRENCHMAN OR
A NIGERIAN OR A URUGUAYAN. IT IS A SOVIET SCIENTIST WHO HAS IT NOW AND
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE CREDIT."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU FORGET THE GLOBAL FELLOWSHIP OF SCIENCE. DON'T CUT
IT UP INTO SEGMENTS."

 

  "YOU WOULD SPEAK DIFFERENTLY IF IT WERE AN AMERICAN WHO WAS ON THE
EDGE OF THE DISCOVERY AND YOU WERE ASKED TO DO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT
POSSIBLY GIVE THE CREDIT TO ONE OF US. DO YOU REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF
THE AMERICAN REACTION WHEN THE SOVIET UNION WAS THE FIRST TO PUT AN
ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE INTO ORBIT?"

 

  "SURELY WE HAVE ADVANCED SINCE THEN."

 

  "YES, WE HAVE ADVANCED A KILOMETER, BUT WE HAVE NOT ADVANCED TEN
KILOMETERS. THE WORLD IS NOT YET ENTIRELY GLOBAL IN ITS THINKING. THERE
REMAINS NATIONAL PRIDE TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT."

 

  "SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE WORLD. STILL, IF WE ARE NOT GLOBAL AND IF
NATIONAL PRIDE IS SOMETHING WE ARE EXPECTED TO RETAIN, THEN I SHOULD
HAVE MINE. AS AN AMERICAN, WHY SHOULD I BE DISTURBED OVER A SOVIET
SCIENTIST LOSING CREDIT FOR THE DISCOVERY?"

 

  "I ASK YOU ONLY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TO US. I ASK YOU
TO PUT YOURSELF IN OUR PLACE FOR A MOMENT AND SEE IF YOU CAN GRASP OUR
DESPERATION TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT SHAPIROV
KNOWS."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "ALL RIGHT, NATALYA. I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T APPROVE, BUT
I UNDERSTAND. NOW -- LISTEN CAREFULLY, PLEASE -- NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND,
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT OF ME?"

 

  "WE WANT YOU," SAID BORANOVA INTENSELY, "TO HELP US FIND OUT WHAT
SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS -- HIS STILL-LIVING AND EXISTING THOUGHTS -- ARE."

 

  "HOW? THERE'S NOTHING IN MY THEORY THAT MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. EVEN
GRANTING THAT THINKING NETWORKS DO EXIST, AND THAT BRAIN WAVES CAN BE
MINUTELY ANALYZED, AND EVEN GRANTING THAT I OCCASIONALLY GET A MENTAL
IMAGE, POSSIBLY IMAGINARY, POSSIBLY AN ARTIFACT -- THERE REMAINS NO WAY
IN WHICH THE BRAIN WAVES CAN BE STUDIED TO THE EXTENT OF INTERPRETING
THEM IN TERMS OF ACTUAL THOUGHTS."

 

  "NOT EVEN IF YOU COULD ANALYZE, IN DETAIL, THE BRAIN WAVES OF A SINGLE
NERVE CELL THAT WAS PART OF A THINKING NETWORK?"

 

  "I COULDN'T DEAL WITH A SINGLE NERVE CELL IN ANYTHING APPROACHING THE
NECESSARY KIND OF DETAIL."

 

  "YOU FORGET. YOU CAN BE MINIATURIZED AND BE INSIDE THAT SINGLE NERVE
CELL."

 

  AND MORRISON STARED AT HER IN SICK HORROR. SHE HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, BUT HE HAD PUT IT ASIDE AS NONSENSE --
HORRIFYING, BUT NONSENSE, SINCE MINIATURIZATION, HE WAS CERTAIN, WAS
IMPOSSIBLE. BUT MINIATURIZATION WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND NOW THE HORROR
WAS UNDILUTED AND PARALYZING.

 

  22.

 

  MORRISON DID NOT THEN, NOR COULD HE AT ANY TIME AFTERWARD, CLEARLY
RECALL THE EVENTS THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED. IT WAS NOT A CASE OF
EVERYTHING GOING BLACK AS MUCH AS EVERYTHING HAVING BLURRED.

 

  HIS NEXT CLEAR MEMORY WAS THAT OF LYING ON A COUCH IN A SMALL OFFICE
WITH BORANOVA LOOKING DOWN AT HIM AND WITH THE OTHER THREE -- DEZHNEV,
KALIININ, AND KONEV -- BEHIND HER. THOSE THREE CAME INTO FOCUS MORE
SLOWLY.

 

  HE TRIED TO STRUGGLE INTO A SITTING POSITION, BUT KONEV MOVED TOWARD
HIM AND PLACED HIS HAND ON MORRISON'S SHOULDER. "PLEASE, ALBERT, REST
AWHILE. GATHER YOUR STRENGTH."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IN CONFUSION. HE HAD BEEN UPSET,
BUT HE DID NOT CLEARLY REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD BEEN UPSET ABOUT.

 

  "WHAT HAPPENED? HOW -- HOW DID I GET HERE?" HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM
AGAIN. NO, HE HADN'T BEEN HERE. HE HAD BEEN LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW AT
A MAN IN A HOSPITAL BED.

 

  HE SAID, PUZZLED, "DID I FAINT?"

 

  "NOT REALLY," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT YOU WEREN'T QUITE YOURSELF FOR A
WHILE. YOU SEEMED TO UNDERGO A SHOCK."

 

  NOW MORRISON REMEMBERED. AGAIN HE TRIED TO LIFT HIMSELF INTO A SITTING
POSITION, MORE STRENUOUSLY THIS TIME. HE STRUCK KONEV'S RESTRAINING HAND
OUT OF THE WAY. HE WAS SITTING UP NOW, WITH HIS HANDS ON THE COUCH ON
EITHER SIDE OF HIM.

 

  "I REMEMBER NOW. YOU WANTED ME TO BE MINIATURIZED. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
WHEN YOU SAID THAT?"

 

  "YOU SIMPLY SWAYED AND -- CRUMPLED. I HAD YOU PLACED ON A STRETCHER
AND BROUGHT HERE. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ANYONE THAT YOU NEEDED MEDICATION,
MERELY A CHANCE TO REST AND RECOVER."

 

  "NO MEDICATION?" MORRISON LOOKED VAGUELY AT HIS ARMS, AS THOUGH HE
EXPECTED TO SEE NEEDLE MARKS THROUGH THE SLEEVE OF HIS COTTON BLOUSE.

 

  "NONE. I ASSURE YOU."

 

  "I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE I COLLAPSED?"

 

  "NOT A WORD."

 

  "THEN LET ME ANSWER YOU NOW. I'M NOT GOING TO BE MINIATURIZED. IS THAT
CLEAR?"

 

  "IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU SAY SO."

 

  DEZHNEV SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH NEXT TO MORRISON. HE HAD A FULL BOTTLE
IN ONE HAND AND AN EMPTY GLASS IN THE OTHER.

 

  "YOU NEED THIS," HE SAID AND HALF-FILLED THE GLASS.

 

  "WHAT IS IT?" ASKED MORRISON, LIFTING HIS ARM TO WARD IT OFF.

 

  "VODKA," SAID DEZHNEV. "IT'S NOT MEDICINAL, IT'S NOURISHING."

 

  "I DON'T DRINK."

 

  "THERE IS A TIME FOR EVERYTHING, MY DEAR ALBERT. THIS IS A TIME FOR A
WARMING BIT OF VODKA, EVEN FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT DRINK."

 

  "I DON'T DRINK OUT OF DISAPPROVAL. I CAN'T DRINK. I HAVE NO HEAD FOR
ALCOHOL, THAT'S ALL. IF I TAKE TWO SWALLOWS OF THAT, I WILL BE DRUNK
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. COMPLETELY DRUNK."

 

  DEZHNEV'S EYEBROWS WENT UP. "SO? WHAT OTHER PURPOSE IS THERE IN
DRINKING? COME, IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WIN YOUR GOAL IN A FEW
INEXPENSIVE SIPS, THANK WHATEVER YOU FIND THANKABLE. A VERY SMALL AMOUNT
WILL WARM YOU, STIMULATE YOUR PERIPHERAL CIRCULATION, CLEAR YOUR HEAD,
CONCENTRATE YOUR THOUGHTS. IT WILL EVEN GIVE YOU COURAGE."

 

  KALIININ'S VOICE SOUNDED IN HALF A WHISPER, BUT WAS DISTINCTLY
AUDIBLE. "DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES OF A LITTLE ALCOHOL."

 

  MORRISON'S HEAD TWISTED SHARPLY AND HE LOOKED AT HER. SHE DID NOT SEEM
AS PRETTY AS HE HAD THOUGHT HER ON THEIR FIRST MEETING. THERE WAS A HARD
AND UNFORGIVING LOOK ABOUT HER.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I HAVE NEVER REPRESENTED MYSELF AS A COURAGEOUS MAN. I
HAVE NEVER PRESENTED MYSELF AS ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE OF HELP TO YOU. I
HAVE MAINTAINED FROM THE BEGINNING THAT I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
THAT I AM HERE AT ALL IS THE RESULT OF COMPULSION, AS YOU ALL KNOW. WHAT
DO I OWE YOU? WHAT DO I OWE ANY OF YOU?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT, YOU ARE SHIVERING. TAKE A SIP OF THE VODKA.
YOU WILL NOT BE DRUNK ON A SIP AND WE WON'T FORCE MORE ON YOU."

 

  ALMOST AS THOUGH TO SHOW BRAVERY IN A SMALL WAY, MORRISON, AFTER A
MOMENT'S HESITATION, TOOK THE GLASS FROM DEZHNEV'S HAND AND SWALLOWED A
BIT OF THE LIQUOR RECKLESSLY. HE FELT A BURNING SENSATION IN HIS THROAT,
WHICH PASSED. THE TASTE WAS RATHER SWEETISH THAN OTHERWISE. HE TOOK A
LARGER SIP AND HANDED THE GLASS BACK. DEZHNEV TOOK IT AND PLACED IT AND
THE BOTTLE ON A SMALL TABLE ON HIS SIDE OF THE COUCH.

 

  MORRISON TRIED TO SPEAK, BUT HE COUGHED INSTEAD. HE WAITED, CLEARED
HIS THROAT, AND SAID BREATHILY, "ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT SO BAD. IF YOU
DON'T MIND, ARKADY --"

 

  DEZHNEV REACHED FOR THE GLASS, BUT BORANOVA SAID, "NO. THAT'S ENOUGH,
ALBERT." HER IMPERIOUS GESTURE STOPPED DEZHNEV. "WE DO NOT WANT YOU
DRUNK, ALBERT. JUST A LITTLE WARM SO YOU WILL LISTEN TO US."

 

  MORRISON COULD FEEL THE WARMTH RISING WITHIN HIM, AS IT ALWAYS HAD
WHEN, ON RARE OCCASIONS OF SOCIAL BONHOMIE, HE HAD HAD SOME SHERRY OR
(ONCE) A DRY MARTINI. HE DECIDED HE COULD HANDLE ANY ARGUMENT SHE COULD
PRODUCE.

 

  "ALL RIGHT," HE SAID, "SAY ON," AND SET HIS LIPS INTO A FIRM AND
UNYIELDING LINE.

 

  "I DON'T SAY, ALBERT, YOU OWE US ANYTHING AND I'M SORRY THAT ALL THIS
CAME AS SUCH A SHOCK TO YOU. WE ARE AWARE THAT YOU ARE NOT A RECKLESS
MAN OF ACTION AND WE TRIED TO BREAK IT TO YOU AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE. I
HAD HOPED, IN FACT, THAT YOU WOULD SEE WHAT WAS ESSENTIAL ON YOUR OWN,
WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY OF EXPLANATION."

 

  "YOU WERE WRONG," SAID MORRISON. "AT NO TIME WOULD SUCH A MAD THING
HAVE OCCURRED TO ME."

 

  "YOU SEE OUR NECESSITY, DON'T YOU?"

 

  "I SEE YOUR NECESSITY. I DON'T SEE IT AS MINE.

 

  "YOU MIGHT FEEL YOU OWE IT TO THE CAUSE OF GLOBAL SCIENCE."

 

  "GLOBAL SCIENCE IS AN ABSTRACTION THAT I ADMIRE, BUT I AM NOT LIKELY
TO WANT TO SACRIFICE MY HIGHLY CONCRETE BODY FOR AN ABSTRACTION THAT
DOESN'T SEEM TO EXIST. THE WHOLE POINT OF YOUR NECESSITY IS THAT IT IS
SOVIET SCIENCE THAT IS AT STAKE, NOT GLOBAL SCIENCE."

 

  "THEN CONSIDER AMERICAN SCIENCE," SAID BORANOVA, "IF YOU HELP US, THAT
WILL BECOME AN ETERNAL PART OF THE VICTORY. IT WILL BECOME A JOINT
SOVIET-AMERICAN VICTORY."

 

  "WILL MY PART BE PUBLICIZED?" DEMANDED MORRISON. "OR WILL THE THING BE
ANNOUNCED AS PURELY SOVIET?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU HAVE MY WORD."

 

  "YOU CANNOT COMMIT THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT."

 

  "HORRIBLE," SAID KALIININ. "HE JUDGES OUR GOVERNMENT BY HIS OWN."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WAIT, NATALYA. LET ME TALK TO OUR AMERICAN FRIEND, MAN TO
MAN." HE SAT DOWN BY MORRISON AND SAID, "ALBERT, I APPEAL TO YOUR
INTEREST IN YOUR WORK. SO FAR, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF
RESULTS. YOU HAVE CONVINCED NO ONE IN YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHANCE OF DOING SO AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEFT WITH ONLY THE TOOLS YOU
HAVE. WE OFFER YOU A BETTER TOOL, ONE WHOSE WORTH YOU COULDN'T DREAM OF
THREE DAYS AGO AND ONE WHICH YOU'LL NEVER HAVE AGAIN IF YOU TURN AWAY
FROM IT NOW. ALBERT, YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO GRADUATE FROM ROMANTIC
SPECULATIONS TO CONVINCING EVIDENCE. DO THIS FOR US AND YOU WILL BECOME,
AT A BOUND, THE MOST FAMOUS NEUROPHYSICIST IN THE WORLD."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU'RE ASKING ME TO RISK MY LIFE ON AN UNTRIED
TECHNIQUE."

 

  "THAT IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED. ALL THROUGH HISTORY, SCIENTISTS HAVE
RISKED DEATH TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS. THEY HAVE GONE UP IN
BALLOONS AND HAVE DIPPED UNDER THE SEAS IN PRIMITIVE ARMORED SPHERES TO
MAKE THEIR MEASUREMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS. CHEMISTS HAVE RISKED DEALING
WITH POISONS AND EXPLOSIVES, BIOLOGISTS WITH PATHOGENS OF ALL TYPES.
PHYSICIANS HAVE INJECTED THEMSELVES WITH EXPERIMENTAL SERA AND
PHYSICISTS, IN ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH A SELF-SUPPORTING NUCLEAR
REACTION, KNEW WELL THAT THE EXPLOSION THAT RESULTED MIGHT DESTROY THEM
OR, CONCEIVABLY, THE ENTIRE PLANET."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU SPIN DREAMS. YOU WOULD NEVER LET IT BE KNOWN THAT
AN AMERICAN PLAYED A ROLE. NOT WHEN YOU CONFESS YOUR DESPERATION AT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT SOVIET SCIENCE WOULD LOSE THE CREDIT."

 

  KONEV SAID, "LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER, ALBERT. WE COULDN'T HIDE
YOUR SHARE IN THIS, EVEN IF WE WISHED TO. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT KNOWS
WE BROUGHT YOU HERE. WE KNOW THEY DO. YOU KNOW THEY DO. THEY MADE NO
MOVE TO STOP US BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU HERE. WELL, THEY WILL KNOW -- OR
AT LEAST GUESS -- WHAT WE WANTED YOU HERE FOR AND WHAT YOU DID FOR US,
ONCE WE ANNOUNCE OUR SUCCESS. AND THEY WILL SEE TO IT THAT AMERICAN
SCIENCE, IN YOUR PERSON, WILL GET FULL CREDIT."

 

  MORRISON SAT SILENTLY, HEAD BENT, FOR A WHILE. THERE WAS A FLUSHED
SPOT, HIGH ON EACH CHEEK, AS A RESULT OF THE VODKA HE HAD DRUNK. WITHOUT
LOOKING, HE KNEW THAT FOUR PAIRS OF EYES WERE FIRMLY FIXED UPON HIM AND
HE SUSPECTED THAT FOUR BREATHS WERE BEING HELD.

 

  HE LOOKED UP AND SAID, "LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. HOW DID SHAPIROV
COME TO BE IN A COMA?"

 

  THERE WAS AGAIN A SILENCE AND THREE OF THE PAIRS OF STARING EYES
SHIFTED TO NATALYA BORANOVA.

 

  MORRISON, SEEING THAT, ALSO STARED AT HER. "WELL?" HE SAID.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT, I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, EVEN IF THAT WOULD
TEND TO DEFEAT OUR AIMS. IF WE TRY TO LIE TO YOU, YOU WILL BE RIGHT NOT
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING WE SAY. IF YOU SEE WE ARE TRUTHFUL, THEN YOU CAN
BELIEVE US IN THE FUTURE. ALBERT, ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV IS IN A COMA
BECAUSE HE WAS MINIATURIZED, AS WE HOPE YOU WILL BE. THERE WAS A SMALL
ACCIDENT DURING DEMINIATURIZING THAT DESTROYED PART OF HIS BRAIN,
APPARENTLY PERMANENTLY. THAT CAN HAPPEN, YOU SEE, AND WE ARE NOT HIDING
IT FROM YOU. NOW GIVE US THE CREDIT FOR UTTER FRANKNESS AND SAY YOU WILL
HELP US."

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 6 -- DECISION

 

  WE ARE ALWAYS CERTAIN THAT THE DECISION WE HAVE JUST MADE IS WRONG.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  23.

 

  NOW, FINALLY, MORRISON ROSE, FEELING A TRIFLE UNSTEADY ON HIS FEET --
WHETHER FROM THE VODKA, FROM THE GENERAL TENSION OF THE DAY, OR FROM
THIS LAST REVELATION HE DID NOT KNOW OR CARE. HE STAMPED HIS FEET A
LITTLE, AS THOUGH TO FIRM THEM, THEN DELIBERATELY WALKED THE LENGTH OF
THE SMALL ROOM AND BACK.

 

  HE FACED BORANOVA AND SAID IN A HARSH VOICE, "YOU CAN MINIATURIZE A
RABBIT AND NOTHING SEEMS TO HAPPEN TO IT. DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THE
HUMAN BRAIN IS THE MOST COMPLEX BIT OF MATTER WE KNOW AND THAT, WHATEVER
ELSE MIGHT SURVIVE, THE HUMAN BRAIN MIGHT NOT?"

 

  "IT DID," SAID BORANOVA STOLIDLY, "BUT ALL OUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE
SHOWN US THAT MINIATURIZATION DOES NOT IN THE LEAST AFFECT THE
INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE OBJECT BEING MINIATURIZED. IN THEORY, EVEN
THE HUMAN BRAIN WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "IN THEORY!" SAID MORRISON WITH CONTEMPT. "HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT,
BASED ON THEORY ALONE, YOU WOULD EXPERIMENT WITH SHAPIROV, WHOSE BRAIN
YOU SEEM TO VALUE SO HIGHLY? AND HAVING FAILED WITH HIM, TO YOUR
ENORMOUS LOSS, HOW CAN YOU BE SO MAD AS TO PROPOSE EXPERIMENTING WITH ME
TO RECOVER THAT LOSS? YOU'LL SIMPLY FAIL WITH ME, TOO, AND I CANNOT
ACCEPT THAT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "DON'T SPEAK NONSENSE. WE ARE NOT MAD. NOTHING WE DID
WAS LIGHTLY UNDERTAKEN. THE FAULT WAS SHAPIROV'S."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IN A WAY, IT WAS. SHAPIROV HAD HIS ECCENTRIC WAYS.
'CRAZY PETER' I BELIEVE YOU CALL HIM IN ENGLISH AND THAT IS PERHAPS NOT
SO FAR OFF. HE WAS INTENT ON HAVING THE MINIATURIZATION EXPERIENCE. HE
WAS GETTING OLD, HE SAID, AND HE WOULD NOT, LIKE MOSES, REACH THE
PROMISED LAND WITHOUT ENTERING IT."

 

  "HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORBIDDEN TO DO SO."

 

  "BY ME? I WOULD FORBID SHAPIROV? YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS."

 

  "NOT YOU. YOUR GOVERNMENT. IF THE MINIATURIZATION PROCESS IS SO
PRECIOUS TO THE SOVIET UNION --"

 

  "SHAPIROV THREATENED TO ABANDON THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER IF HE DID NOT
HAVE HIS WAY AND THAT COULD NOT BE RISKED. NOR IS OUR GOVERNMENT QUITE
SO HIGH-HANDED AS IT ONCE WAS IN ITS PRESSURES ON TROUBLESOME
SCIENTISTS. IT MUST TAKE WORLD OPINION INTO GREATER ACCOUNT NOW, AS YOUR
GOVERNMENT MUST. IT IS THE PRICE OF GLOBAL COOPERATION. WHETHER THAT IS
FOR THE BETTER OR FOR THE WORSE, I CANNOT SAY. IN ANY CASE, SHAPIROV WAS
EVENTUALLY MINIATURIZED."

 

  MORRISON MUTTERED, "ABSOLUTELY MAD."

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA, "FOR WE DID NOT MOVE WITHOUT PRECAUTIONS. DESPITE
THE FACT THAT EVERY EXERCISE IN MINIATURIZATION IS COSTLY AND SENDS
SHIVERS THROUGH THE CENTRAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE, WE INSISTED ON A
CAREFUL APPROACH. TWICE WE MINIATURIZED CHIMPANZEES AND TWICE WE BROUGHT
THEM BACK AND COULD DETECT NO CHANGES IN THEM -- EITHER AS A RESULT OF
MINUTE STUDIES OF THEIR BEHAVIOR OR BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE
BRAIN."

 

  "A CHIMPANZEE IS NOT A HUMAN BEING," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "SOMETHING WE WERE AWARE OF," SAID BORANOVA GRAVELY. "THEREFORE, WE
MINIATURIZED A HUMAN BEING NEXT. A VOLUNTEER. YURI KONEV, TO BE
PRECISE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT HAD TO BE ME. IT WAS I WHO FELT MOST STRONGLY THAT THE
HUMAN BRAIN WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED. I AM THE NEUROPHYSICIST OF THE
PROJECT AND IT WAS I WHO MADE THE NECESSARY CALCULATIONS. I WOULD NOT
ASK ANOTHER HUMAN BEING TO RISK HIS SANITY ON MY CALCULATIONS AND MY
CERTAINTY. LIFE IS ONE THING -- WE ALL LOSE IT SOONER OR LATER. SANITY
IS QUITE ANOTHER."

 

  "SO BRAVE," WHISPERED KALIININ, LOOKING AT HER FINGERTIPS, "THE DEED
OF A TRUE SOVIET HERO." HER LIP TREMBLED, AS THOUGH ON THE BRINK OF A
SNEER.

 

  LOOKING FIRMLY AT MORRISON, KONEV SAID, "I AM A LOYAL SOVIET CITIZEN,
BUT I DID NOT DO IT FOR NATIONALIST MOTIVES. THEY WOULD BE, IN THIS
CASE, IRRELEVANT. I DID IT AS A MATTER OF DECENCY AND OF SCIENTIFIC
ETHICS. I HAD CONFIDENCE IN MY ANALYSIS AND OF WHAT WORTH WAS MY
CONFIDENCE IF I WOULD NOT RISK MYSELF ON IT? AND IT IS A MATTER OF
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO. WHEN THE HISTORY OF MINIATURIZATION IS RECORDED, I
WILL BE LISTED AS THE FIRST HUMAN BEING EVER TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO
THE PROCESS. THAT WILL ECLIPSE THE DEEDS OF A GREAT-GRAND-UNCLE OF MINE
WHO WAS A GENERAL FIGHTING THE GERMAN NAZIS IN THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR.
AND I WOULD BE PLEASED WITH THAT, NOT OUT OF VAINGLORY BUT OUT OF A
BELIEF THAT THE CONQUESTS OF PEACE SHOULD ALWAYS BE HELD SUPERIOR TO
VICTORIES IN WAR."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WELL, PUTTING IDEALS TO ONE SIDE AND PASSING ON TO THE
FACTS. YURI WAS MINIATURIZED TWICE. FIRST, HE WAS TAKEN DOWN TO ABOUT
HALF HIS HEIGHT AND WAS RESTORED IN PERFECT ORDER. THEN HE WAS
MINIATURIZED TO THE SIZE OF A MOUSE AND AGAIN WAS RESTORED IN PERFECT
ORDER."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "AND THEN SHAPIROV?"

 

  "AND THEN SHAPIROV. HE WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO CONTROL EVEN THIS FAR.
HE ARGUED VOCIFEROUSLY FOR THE CHANCE TO BE THE FIRST PERSON
MINIATURIZED. AFTER KONEV'S FIRST VENTURE INTO THE SMALL, IT WAS ALL WE
COULD DO TO PERSUADE HIM TO WAIT FOR A SECOND AND MORE DRASTIC ATTEMPT.
AFTER THAT WE COULD CONTROL HIM NO MORE. NOT ONLY WERE WE FORCED TO
MINIATURIZE HIM, BUT HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD ABANDON THE PROJECT AND
SOMEHOW MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN A MINIATURIZATION
PROJECT ELSEWHERE IF WE DID NOT MINIATURIZE HIM TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN
WE HAD KONEV. WE HAD NO CHOICE. IF 'CRAZY PETER,' AS YOU CALL HIM, WERE
MAD ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF EMIGRATING, THAT WOULD GO BEYOND WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE WILLING TO ALLOW EVEN IN THESE DAYS. WE DIDN'T WANT
HIM IN PRISON, SO WE MINIATURIZED HIM TO THE SIZE OF A CELL."

 

  "AND THAT PASSED THE LIMITS OF SAFETY, DID IT?"

 

  "NO. WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO THINK HE WAS IN PERFECT ORDER, EVEN
MINIATURIZED SO FAR. HE WAS BEING BROUGHT BACK AND THEN AT ONE POINT IN
THE DEMINIATURIZATION THERE WAS A MISADVENTURE. DEMINIATURIZATION TOOK
PLACE A TRIFLE TOO QUICKLY AND THE TEMPERATURE ROSE SLIGHTLY IN
SHAPIROV'S BODY. IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A HIGH FEVER -- NOT ENOUGH TO KILL
HIM, BUT ENOUGH TO DAMAGE HIS BRAIN PERMANENTLY. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
REVERSED IF WE COULD HAVE ATTENDED TO HIM AT ONCE, BUT DEMINIATURIZATION
HAD TO BE COMPLETED AND THAT TOOK TIME. IT WAS AN APPALLING CATASTROPHE
AND ALL THAT WE CAN HOPE FOR IS THE CHANCE TO SALVAGE WHAT WE NEED FROM
WHAT IS LEFT OF HIS BRAIN."

 

  "THERE MAY BE ANOTHER MISADVENTURE, AS YOU CALL IT, IF I WERE TO BE
MINIATURIZED. ISN'T THAT SO?"

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA, "THAT IS SO. I DON'T DENY IT. THERE HAVE BEEN
FAILURES AND MISADVENTURES THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE. SURELY YOU
NEED NO REMINDER THAT THERE WERE DEATHS OF COSMONAUTS IN SPACE BOTH ON
THE AMERICAN AND SOVIET SIDES. THAT DID NOT PREVENT OUR PRESENT
SETTLEMENT OF THE MOON -- AND OF SPACE ITSELF -- AS A NEW HOME FOR
HUMANITY."

 

  "THAT MAY BE SO, BUT ALL ADVANCES IN SPACE WERE MADE BY VOLUNTEERS. NO
ONE WAS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE AGAINST HIS WILL. AND I AM NOT
VOLUNTEERING."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU NEED NOT BE SO FRIGHTENED OF IT. WE HAVE DONE OUR
BEST TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND, BY THE WAY, YOU WILL NOT GO
ALONE. KONEV AND SHAPIROV DID GO ALONE AND AS BARE AS THE RABBIT, FOR
THEY, LIKE THE RABBIT, WERE IN A MINIATURIZATION FIELD THAT WAS ENCASED
IN AIR. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL BE IN A SHIP, A KIND OF MODIFIED
SUBMARINE. IT, TOO, HAS BEEN MINIATURIZED AND DEMINIATURIZED WITHOUT
HARM. IT IS A LITTLE LESS EXPENSIVE TO CARRY THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH AN
INANIMATE OBJECT BECAUSE IT CAN STAND A RISE IN TEMPERATURE MORE EASILY.
IN FACT, SUCH A RISE SERVES TO TEST FOR THE RUGGEDNESS AND STABILITY OF
ALL ITS COMPONENTS."

 

  "I AM NOT GOING, NATALYA, EITHER ALONE OR WITH THE RED ARMY."

 

  BORANOVA IGNORED THE REMARK. "WITH YOU ON THE SHIP," SHE SAID, "WILL
BE WE FOUR. MYSELF, SOPHIA, YURI, AND ARKADY. THAT IS WHY I HAVE
INTRODUCED EACH OF THEM TO YOU. WE ARE ALL PARTNERS IN THIS GREATEST OF
ALL EXPLORING TRIPS. WE WILL NOT BE CROSSING AN OCEAN OR PENETRATING THE
VACUUM OF SPACE. WE WILL INSTEAD ENTER A MICROSCOPIC OCEAN AND PENETRATE
THE HUMAN BRAIN. CAN YOU BE A SCIENTIST -- A NEUROPHYSICIST -- AND
RESIST THAT?"

 

  "YES. I CAN RESIST THAT. AND EASILY. I WILL NOT GO."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE HAVE YOUR SOFTWARE, YOUR PROGRAM. YOU ALWAYS CARRY
IT WITH YOU AND YOU HAD IT WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE. WE WILL
HAVE A COMPUTER ON BOARD THE SHIP FOR YOU, ONE THAT IS THE EXACT MODEL
OF THE ONE YOU USE IN YOUR LABORATORY. IT SHOULD NOT BE A LONG TRIP. WE
WILL ALL BE MINIATURIZED, TAKING OUR CHANCES ALONG WITH YOU. YOU WILL
TAKE YOUR COMPUTER READINGS AND RECORD THE SENSATIONS YOU RECEIVE AND
THEN WE WILL ALL BE DEMINIATURIZED AND YOUR PART WILL BE DONE WITH. SAY
THAT YOU WILL JOIN US. SAY YOU WILL DO IT."

 

  AND MORRISON, FISTS CLENCHED, SAID STUBBORNLY, "I WILL NOT JOIN YOU. I
WILL NOT DO IT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I AM SO SORRY, ALBERT, BUT THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER.
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT IT."

 

  24.

 

  MORRISON FELT HIS HEART RACING AGAIN. IF THIS WAS GOING TO BE A
STRAIGHTFORWARD CONTEST OF WILLS, HE WAS NOT SURE HE WAS UP TO COPING
WITH THIS WOMAN WHO, DESPITE ALL HER APPARENT SOFTNESS, SEEMED MADE OF
ALLOY STEEL. MOREOVER, SHE HAD BEHIND HER THE FULL APPARATUS OF THE
SOVIET UNION AND HE HIMSELF WAS ALONE.

 

  HE SAID DESPERATELY, "SURELY YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE THING IS A TRUMPED-UP
ROMANTIC NOTION. HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
PLANCK'S CONSTANT AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT? ALL YOU HAVE IS SOME STATEMENT
BY SHAPIROV. ISN'T THAT CORRECT? DID HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS? ANY
EVIDENCE? ANY EXPLANATIONS? ANY MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS? -- IT WAS NOTHING
MORE THAN A STATEMENT -- AN IMAGINATIVE SPECULATION -- WASN'T IT?"

 

  MORRISON TRIED TO SOUND CONFIDENT. AFTER ALL, IF SHAPIROV HAD GIVEN
THEM ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVE, THEY WOULD NOT NOW BE TRYING THE DESPERATE
TRICK OF RIFLING HIS BRAIN FOR SOMETHING USEFUL. HE HELD HIS BREATH,
WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE.

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AT KONEV THEN SAID, WITH A SHADE OF RELUCTANCE, "WE
WILL CONTINUE OUR POLICY OF TELLING THE FLAT AND UNADORNED TRUTH. WE
HAVE NOTHING BUT SOME REMARKS SHAPIROV MADE, AS YOU'VE GUESSED. HE
ENJOYED KEEPING THINGS TO HIMSELF UNTIL HE COULD SPRING THEM ON US FULLY
DRESSED, SO TO SPEAK. HE WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CHILDISH IN THIS
RESPECT. PERHAPS THAT WAS AN ASPECT OF HIS ECCENTRICITY -- OR OF HIS
GENIUS -- OR OF BOTH."

 

  "BUT HOW CAN YOU TELL, UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT SUCH AN
UNSUPPORTED SPECULATION WOULD HAVE ANY VALIDITY WHATEVER?"

 

  "WHEN ACADEMICIAN PYOTOR SHAPIROV SAID, 'I FEEL IT WILL BE THUS AND
SO,' THAT IS HOW IT TURNED OUT TO BE."

 

  "COME ON. ALWAYS?"

 

  "ALMOST ALWAYS."

 

  "ALMOST ALWAYS. HE COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG THIS TIME."

 

  "I ADMIT THAT. HE COULD HAVE BEEN."

 

  "OR IF HE HAD SOME NOTION WHICH WOULD REALLY PROVE OF USE, IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED IN THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH HAS BEEN DESTROYED."

 

  "THAT IS CONCEIVABLE."

 

  "OR IF THE NOTION IS USEFUL AND IS STILL IN THE INTACT PORTION OF THE
BRAIN, I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO INTERPRET THE BRAIN WAVES PROPERLY."

 

  "THAT MAY WELL BE."

 

  "PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: SHAPIROV'S SUGGESTION MAY BE WRONG AND, EVEN
IF IT ISN'T, IT MIGHT BE OUT OF REACH OR, EVEN IF IT ISN'T, I MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO INTERPRET IT. CONSIDERING THAT, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF
SUCCESS? AND CAN'T YOU SEE THAT WE WILL BE PUTTING OUR LIVES INTO DANGER
FOR SOMETHING WE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY FAIL TO GET?"

 

  "CONSIDERING THE MATTER OBJECTIVELY," SAID BORANOVA, "IT WOULD SEEM
THE CHANCES ARE VERY SMALL. HOWEVER, IF WE DO NOT HAZARD OUR LIVES, THE
CHANCES OF OBTAINING ANYTHING AT ALL ARE ZERO -- FLAT ZERO. IF WE DO
RISK OUR LIVES, THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE VERY SMALL, ADMITTEDLY, BUT
THEY ARE NOT ZERO. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MUST TAKE THE RISK, EVEN
THOUGH THE BEST WE CAN SAY FOR OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE THAT THEY ARE
NOT ZERO."

 

  "FOR ME," SAID MORRISON, "THE RISK IS TOO GREAT AND THE CHANCES OF
SUCCESS ARE TOO SMALL."

 

  BORANOVA PLACED ONE HAND ON MORRISON'S SHOULDER AND SAID, "SURELY THAT
IS NOT YOUR FINAL DECISION."

 

  "SURELY IT IS."

 

  "THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE VALUE TO THE SOVIET UNION. THINK
ABOUT THE BENEFITS TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY THAT WILL RESULT FROM YOUR
ACKNOWLEDGED PARTICIPATION, TO THE NEEDS OF GLOBAL SCIENCE, TO YOUR OWN
FAME AND REPUTATION. ALL THIS IS IN FAVOR OF DOING IT. AGAINST IT ARE
YOUR PERSONAL FEARS. THESE ARE UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT ALL ACHIEVEMENT IN
LIFE REQUIRES THE OVERCOMING OF FEAR."

 

  "THINKING ABOUT IT WON'T CHANGE MY MIND."

 

  "THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING, ANYWAY. THAT'S FIFTEEN HOURS
AND IT'S ALL WE CAN SPARE YOU. AFTER ALL, BALANCING FEARS AGAINST HOPES
CAN KEEP ONE IRRESOLUTE FOR A LIFETIME AND WE DON'T HAVE A LIFETIME.
POOR SHAPIROV MIGHT LINGER ON IN COMA FOR A DECADE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG WHAT IS LEFT OF HIS BRAIN WILL RETAIN HIS IDEAS AND WE DARE NOT
WAIT VERY LONG AT ALL."

 

  "I CAN NOT AND WILL NOT CONCERN MYSELF WITH YOUR PROBLEMS."

 

  BORANOVA SEEMED TO HEAR NONE OF HIS DENIALS AND REFUSALS. SHE SAID IN
HER UNFAILINGLY GENTLE VOICE, "WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE YOU
FURTHER RIGHT NOW. YOU MAY HAVE A LEISURELY DINNER. YOU MAY WATCH OUR
HOLOVISION PROGRAMS IF YOU WISH, VIEW OUR BOOKS, THINK, SLEEP. ARKADY
WILL ACCOMPANY YOU BACK TO THE HOTEL AND IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,
YOU NEED ONLY ASK HIM."

 

  MORRISON NODDED.

 

  "AND, ALBERT, REMEMBER, TOMORROW MORNING YOU MUST GIVE US YOUR
DECISION."

 

  "TAKE IT NOW. IT WILL NOT CHANGE."

 

  "NO. THE DECISION MUST BE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US AND HELP US. SEE TO IT
THAT YOU COME TO THAT DECISION -- FOR COME TO IT YOU MUST -- AND IT WILL
BE EASIER FOR ALL OF US IF YOU DO SO GLADLY AND VOLUNTARILY."

 

  25.

 

  IT PROVED TO BE A QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL DINNER FOR MORRISON AND NOT A
VERY FILLING ONE -- FOR HE FOUND HE COULD ONLY PICK AT HIS FOOD. DEZHNEV
SEEMED QUITE UNAFFECTED BY THE OTHER'S LACK OF APPETITE AND REACTION. HE
ATE VIGOROUSLY AND SPOKE INCESSANTLY, DRAWING ON WHAT WAS APPARENTLY A
LARGE STOCK OF FUNNY STORIES -- IN ALL OF WHICH HIS FATHER PLAYED A KEY
ROLE -- AND WAS CLEARLY DELIGHTED TO TRY THEM OUT ON A NEW AUDIENCE.

 

  MORRISON SMILED FAINTLY AT ONE OR TWO, MORE BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZED FROM
THE OTHER'S RAISED VOICE THAT A PUNCH LINE HAD BEEN ADVANCED THAN
BECAUSE HE HEARD THEM WITH ANY INTEREST AT ALL.

 

  VALERI PALERON, THE WAITRESS WHO HAD SERVED THEM AT BREAKFAST, WAS
STILL THERE AT DINNER. A LONG DAY -- BUT EITHER THAT WAS REFLECTED IN
HER WAGES OR IT WAS REQUIRED BY HER EXTRACURRICULAR DUTIES. EITHER WAY,
SHE GLOWERED AT DEZHNEV EACH TIME SHE APPROACHED THE TABLE, PERHAPS
(MORRISON THOUGHT DISTANTLY) BECAUSE SHE DISAPPROVED OF HIS STORIES,
WHICH TENDED TO BE DISRESPECTFUL OF THE SOVIET REGIME.

 

  MORRISON DID NOT PARTICULARLY ENJOY HIS OWN THOUGHTS. NOW THAT HE WAS
CONSIDERING THE DISTANT POSSIBILITY OF GETTING AWAY FROM THE GROTTO --
FROM MALENKIGRAD -- FROM THE SOVIET UNION -- HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A
PERVERSE DISAPPOINTMENT AT WHAT HE MIGHT BE MISSING. HE FOUND HIMSELF
DAYDREAMING JUST A LITTLE ON THE MATTER OF MINIATURIZATION, OF USING IT
TO PROVE THE WORTH OF HIS THEORIES, OF TRIUMPHING OVER THE SMUG FOOLS
WHO HAD DISMISSED HIM OUT OF HAND.

 

  HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT, OF ALL THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY
BORANOVA, ONLY THE PERSONAL ONE HAD SHAKEN HIM. ANY REFERENCE TO THE
GREATER GOOD OF SCIENCE, OR OF HUMANITY, OR OF THIS NATION OR THAT WAS
JUST IDLE RHETORIC. HIS OWN PLACE IN SCIENCE WAS SOMETHING MORE. THAT
SEETHED WITHIN HIM.

 

  WHEN THE SERVING WOMAN PASSED NEAR THE TABLE, HE STIRRED HIMSELF TO
SAY, "HOW LONG MUST YOU STAY ON, WAITRESS?"

 

  SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT FAVOR. "UNTIL YOU TWO GRAND DUKES CAN BRING
YOURSELVES TO STIR OUT OF HERE."

 

  "THERE'S NO RUSH," SAID DEZHNEV AS HE EMPTIED HIS GLASS. HIS SPEECH
WAS ALREADY SLURRED AND HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED. "I AM SO FOND OF THE
COMRADE WAITRESS, I COULD STAY ON FOR AS LONG AS THE VOLGA FLOWS, THAT I
MIGHT GAZE ON HER FACE."

 

  "AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE TO GAZE AT YOURS," MUTTERED PALERON.

 

  MORRISON FILLED DEZHNEV'S GLASS AND SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MADAME
BORANOVA?"

 

  DEZHNEV GAZED AT THE GLASS OWLISHLY AND DID NOT OFFER TO LIFT IT
IMMEDIATELY. HE SAID WITH AN ATTEMPT AT GRAVITY, "NOT A FIRST-CLASS
SCIENTIST, I AM TOLD, BUT AN EXCELLENT ADMIN-MINISTRATOR. KEEN, MAKES UP
HER MIND QUICKLY, AND ABSOLUTELY INCORR-CORRUPTIBLE. A PAIN IN THE NECK,
I SHOULD THINK. IF AN ADMINISTRATOR IS INCORR-- TOO INFERNALLY HONEST,
IT MAKES LIFE HARD IN SO MANY LITTLE WAYS. SHE IS A WORSHIPPER OF
SHAPIROV, TOO, AND SHE THINKS HIM INCORR-- NO, INCOMPRE-- NO,
INCONTROVERTIBLE. THAT'S IT."

 

  MORRISON WAS NOT SURE OF THE RUSSIAN WORD. "YOU MEAN SHE THINKS HE'S
ALWAYS RIGHT."

 

  "EXACTLY. IF HE HINTS THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE MINIATURIZATION CHEAP,
SHE'S SURE HE CAN. YURI KONEV IS SURE OF IT, TOO. HE'S ANOTHER OF THE
WORSHIPPERS. BUT IT'S BORA-- BORANOVA WHO'LL SEND YOU INTO SHAPIROV'S
BRAIN. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, SHE'LL SEND YOU THERE. SHE HAS HER WAYS. --
AS FOR YURI, THAT LITTLE SHAVER, HE'S THE REAL SCIENTIST OF THE GROUP.
VERY BRILLIANT." DEZHNEV NODDED SOLEMNLY AND SIPPED AT HIS REFILLED
DRINK GENTLY.

 

  "I'M INTERESTED IN YURI KONEV," SAID MORRISON, HIS EYES FOLLOWING THE
LIFTING OF THE GLASS, "AND IN THE YOUNG WOMAN, SOPHIA KALIININ."

 

  DEZHNEV LEERED. "A FINE YOUNG PIECE." THEN SADLY, SHAKING HIS HEAD,
"BUT SHE HAS NO SENSE OF HUMOR."

 

  "SHE'S MARRIED, I TAKE IT."

 

  DEZHNEV SHOOK HIS HEAD MORE VIOLENTLY THAN THE OCCASION SEEMED TO
REQUIRE. "NO."

 

  "SHE SAID SHE HAD HAD A BABY."

 

  "YES, A LITTLE GIRL, BUT IT ISN'T THE SIGNING OF THE MARRIAGE BOOK
THAT MAKES ONE PREGNANT. IT'S THE GAME OF BED -- MARRIED OR NOT."

 

  "DOES THE PURITANICAL SOVIET GOVERNMENT APPROVE OF THIS?"

 

  "NO, BUT ITS APPROVAL WAS NEVER ASKED, I THINK." HE BURST INTO
LAUGHTER.

 

  "BESIDES, AS A SCIENTIST AT MALENKIGRAD, SHE HAS HER SPECIAL
DISPEN-PENSATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS THE OTHER WAY."

 

  "IT STRIKES ME," SAID MORRISON, "THAT SOPHIA IS MUCH INTERESTED IN
YURI KONEV."

 

  "YOU SEE THAT, DO YOU? IT TAKES LITTLE SHREWDNESS. SHE IS SO
INTERESTED THAT SHE HAS MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HER CHILD WAS THE
RESULT OF YURI'S COLLABORATION IN THAT LITTLE GAME I SPOKE OF."

 

  "OH?"

 

  "BUT HE DENIES IT. AND VERY VIGOROUSLY, TOO. I THINK IT IS RATHER
HUMOROUS, IN A BITTER WAY, THAT HE REMAINS COMPELLED TO WORK WITH HER.
NEITHER ONE CAN BE SPARED FROM THE PROJECT AND ALL HE CAN DO IS PRETEND
SHE DOESN'T EXIST."

 

  "I NOTICED THAT HE NEVER LOOKS AT HER, BUT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
FRIENDLY ONCE."

 

  "VERY FRIENDLY -- IF SHE IS TO BE BELIEVED. IF SO, THEY WERE VERY
DISCREET ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? SHE DOESN'T NEED HIM TO
SUPPORT THE CHILD. HER SALARY IS A LARGE ONE AND THE DAY-CARE CENTER
TAKES LOVING CARE OF HER DAUGHTER WHEN SHE IS AT WORK. IT IS JUST A
MATTER OF EMOTION WITH HER."

 

  "WHAT SPLIT THEM UP, I WONDER?"

 

  "WHO KNOWS? LOVERS TAKE THEIR DISPUTES SO SERIOUSLY. I MYSELF HAVE
NEVER LET MYSELF FALL IN LOVE -- NOT POETICALLY. IF I LIKE A GIRL, I
PLAY WITH HER. IF I GET TIRED, I MOVE ON. IT IS MY GOOD FORTUNE THAT THE
WOMEN I ENGAGE ARE AS PRAG-PRAGMATIC -- ISN'T THAT A GOOD WORD? -- AS I
AM AND MAKE LITTLE FUSS. AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY, 'A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T
FUSS HAS NO FAULTS.' SOMETIMES, TO BE TRUTHFUL, THEY GROW TIRED BEFORE I
DO, BUT EVEN THEN, SO WHAT? A GIRL WHO IS TIRED OF ME IS NOT MUCH GOOD
TO ME AND, AFTER ALL, THERE ARE OTHERS."

 

  "I SUPPOSE YURI IS MUCH LIKE THAT, TOO, ISN'T HE?"

 

  DEZHNEV HAD EMPTIED HIS GLASS AGAIN AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND WHEN
MORRISON MADE A MOVE TO REFILL IT. "ENOUGH! ENOUGH!"

 

  "NEVER ENOUGH," SAID MORRISON CALMLY. "YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT
YURI."

 

  "WHAT IS THERE TO TELL? YURI IS NOT A MAN TO FLY FROM WOMAN TO WOMAN,
BUT I HAVE HEARD --" HE STARED BLEARILY AT MORRISON. "YOU KNOW HOW ONE
HEARS -- ONE TELLS ANOTHER WHO TELLS ANOTHER AND WHO IS TO KNOW WHETHER
WHAT COMES OUT OF THE FUNNEL IS ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WENT IN. BUT I HAVE
HEARD THAT WHEN YURI WAS IN THE UNITED STATES, BEING EDUCATED
WESTERN-STYLE, HE MET AN AMERICAN GIRL. IN WENT LA BELLE AMERICAINE,
THEY SAY, AND OUT WENT POOR LITTLE SOVIET SOPHIA. PERHAPS THAT WAS IT.
PERHAPS HE CAME BACK DIFFERENT AND PERHAPS HE STILL DREAMS OF HIS LOST
LOVE ACROSS THE SEA."

 

  "AND IS THAT WHY SOPHIA IS SO ILL-DISPOSED TO AMERICANS?"

 

  DEZHNEV STARED AT THE GLASS OF VODKA AND SIPPED A LITTLE OF IT. "OUR
SOPHIA," HE SAID, "HAS NEVER LIKED AMERICANS. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING."
HE LEANED TOWARD MORRISON, HIS BREATH HEAVY WITH FOOD AND DRINK.
"AMERICANS ARE NOT A LOVABLE PEOPLE -- IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT OFFENSE."

 

  "I'M NOT OFFENDED," SAID MORRISON EVENLY, AS HE WATCHED DEZHNEV'S HEAD
SINK SLOWLY AND COME TO REST ON HIS BENT RIGHT ARM. HIS BREATHING GREW
STERTOROUS.

 

  MORRISON WATCHED HIM FOR HALF A MINUTE OR SO, THEN RAISED HIS HAND TO
BECKON THE SERVING WOMAN.

 

  SHE CAME AT ONCE, HER AMPLE HIPS SWINGING. SHE STARED AT THE
UNCONSCIOUS DEZHNEV WITH RATHER MORE THAN HALF A SNEER. "WELL, DO YOU
WISH ME TO GET A LARGE PAIR OF TONGS AND USE THEM TO CARRY OUR PRINCE
HERE TO HIS BED?"

 

  "NOT JUST YET, MISS PALERON. AS YOU KNOW, I'M AN AMERICAN."

 

  "AS EVERYONE KNOWS. YOU HAVE BUT TO SAY THREE WORDS AND THE TABLES AND
CHAIRS IN THIS ROOM NOD TO EACH OTHER AND SAY, 'AN AMERICAN.'"

 

  MORRISON WINCED. HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PROUD OF THE PURITY OF HIS RUSSIAN
AND THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THE WOMAN HAD SNEERED AT IT.

 

  "NEVERTHELESS," HE SAID, "I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE BY FORCE, AGAINST
MY WILL. I BELIEVE IT WAS DONE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOVIET
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE DISAPPROVED OF AND PREVENTED THE ACTION IF
THEY HAD KNOWN. THE PEOPLE HERE -- DR. BORANOVA, WHOM YOU HAVE REFERRED
TO AS THE TSARINA -- HAVE ACTED ON THEIR OWN. THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
SHOULD BE TOLD OF THIS AND THEY WILL THEN ACT SPEEDILY TO RETURN ME TO
THE UNITED STATES AND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT THAT NOBODY
WOULD WANT. DON'T YOU AGREE?"

 

  THE WAITRESS PUT HER FISTS ON HER HIPS AND SAID, "AND OF WHAT MATTER
IS IT TO ANYONE EITHER HERE OR IN THE UNITED STATES AS TO WHETHER I
AGREE OR NOT? AM I A DIPLOMAT? AM I THE REINCARNATED SPIRIT OF TSAR
PETER THE GREAT DRINKER?"

 

  "YOU CAN SEE TO IT," SAID MORRISON, SUDDENLY UNCERTAIN, "THAT THE
GOVERNMENT LEARNS OF IT. QUICKLY."

 

  "WHAT IS IT YOU THINK, AMERICAN? THAT I HAVE BUT TO TELL MY LOVER, WHO
IS ON THE PRESIDIUM, AND ALL WILL BE WELL FOR YOU? WHAT HAVE I TO DO
WITH THE GOVERNMENT? WHAT'S MORE -- AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, COMRADE
FOREIGNER -- I DO NOT WISH YOU TO TALK TO ME IN THIS FASHION AGAIN. MANY
A FINE, LOYAL CITIZEN HAS BEEN HOPELESSLY COMPROMISED BY FOREIGN
BLABBERMOUTHS. I WILL, OF COURSE, REPORT THIS TO COMRADE BORANOVA AT
ONCE AND SHE WILL SEE TO IT THAT YOU DO NOT INSULT ME IN THIS FASHION
AGAIN."

 

  SHE LEFT IN A FLOUNCE AND WITH A SCOWL AND MORRISON STARED AFTER HER
IN DISMAY. AND THEN HIS HEAD WHIRLED IN SURPRISE AND ASTONISHMENT WHEN
HE HEARD DEZHNEV'S VOICE SAYING, "ALBERT, ALBERT, ARE YOU SATISFIED, MY
CHILD?"

 

  DEZHNEV'S HEAD WAS RAISED FROM HIS PILLOWING ARM AND, THOUGH HIS EYES
WERE A LITTLE BLOODSHOT, HIS VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS FUZZINESS. HE
SAID, "I WONDERED WHY YOU WERE SO ANXIOUS TO FILL MY GLASS, SO I GOBBLED
A LITTLE AND LET MYSELF COLLAPSE. IT WAS ALL VERY INTERESTING."

 

  "YOU ARE NOT DRUNK?" SAID MORRISON, GOGGLING AT THE OTHER IN WONDER.

 

  "I HAVE BEEN MORE SOBER IN MY LIFE, CERTAINLY," SAID DEZHNEV, "BUT I
AM NOT UNCONSCIOUS, NOR HAVE I BEEN. YOU NON-DRINKERS HAVE AN
EXAGGERATED IDEA OF THE SPEED WITH WHICH ALL ACCOMPLISHED SOVIET CITIZEN
WILL FALL UNCONSCIOUS WITH DRINK -- WHICH SHOWS THE DANGERS OF BEING A
NONDRINKER."

 

  MORRISON STILL FOUND HIMSELF IN A STATE OF DISBELIEF OVER THE FAILURE
OF THE WAITRESS TO COOPERATE. "YOU SAID SHE WAS AN INTELLIGENCE
OPERATOR."

 

  "DID I?" DEZHNEV SHRUGGED. "I THINK I SAID I SUSPECTED SHE WAS, BUT
SUSPICIONS ARE OFTEN WRONG. BESIDES, SHE KNOWS ME BETTER THAN YOU DO, MY
LITTLE ALBERT, AND WAS PROBABLY UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT I WAS DRUNK. I'LL
BET YOU TEN RUBLES TO A KOPECK THAT SHE KNEW I WAS LISTENING WITH BOTH
EARS. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HER SAY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES?"

 

  "IN THAT CASE," SAID MORRISON, TAKING HEART, "SHE WILL HAVE HEARD WHAT
I SAID AND WILL NEVERTHELESS INFORM YOUR GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF
AFFAIRS. YOUR GOVERNMENT, TO AVOID AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT, WILL THEN
ORDER ME SET FREE, PROBABLY WITH AN APOLOGY, AND YOU PEOPLE HERE WILL
HAVE SOME TALL EXPLAINING TO DO. YOU HAD BETTER FREE ME AND SEND ME BACK
TO THE UNITED STATES OF YOUR OWN ACCORD."

 

  DEZHNEV LAUGHED. "YOUR WASTE YOUR TIME, MY CLEVER INTRIGUER. YOU HAVE
TOO ROMANTIC A NOTION OF OUR GOVERNMENT. CONCEIVABLY, THEY MAY BE
WILLING TO LET YOU GO SOMEDAY BUT, REGARDLESS OF POSSIBLE EMBARRASSMENT,
NOT BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN MINIATURIZED AND --"

 

  "I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE IN AUTHORITY KNOWS YOU KIDNAPPED ME. THEY
CANNOT APPROVE ONCE THEY FIND OUT."

 

  "MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE THEY WILL GRIND THEIR TEETH WHEN THEY
FIND OUT -- BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO? THE GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED TOO MUCH
MONEY IN THE PROJECT TO LET YOU GO BEFORE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR CHANCE TO
MAKE IT PRACTICAL, SO THAT IT WILL REPAY ALL THAT HAS BEEN SPENT -- AND
MORE IN ADDITION. WELL? DOESN'T THAT SEEM LOGICAL TO YOU?"

 

  "NO. BECAUSE I WON'T HELP YOU." MORRISON FELT HIS HEART HARDEN ONCE
AGAIN. "I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE MINIATURIZED."

 

  "THAT WILL BE UP TO NATASHA. SHE WILL BE FURIOUS WITH YOU, YOU KNOW,
AND WILL HAVE NO PITY. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU CALLOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO HAVE
EVERYONE IN THE PROJECT THROWN INTO THE GOVERNMENT'S BAD GRACES, HAVE
SOME OF US RETIRED -- OR WORSE. AND THIS, AFTER WE HAD TREATED YOU WITH
PERFECT CONSIDERATION AND KINDNESS."

 

  "YOU KIDNAPPED ME."

 

  "EVEN THAT WAS DONE WITH PERFECT CONSIDERATION AND KINDNESS. WERE YOU
HURT IN ANY WAY? MISTREATED? YET YOU HAVE TRIED TO HARM US. NATASHA WILL
REPAY YOU FOR THAT."

 

  "HOW? FORCE? TORTURE? DRUGS?"

 

  DEZHNEV TURNED HIS EYES UP TO THE CEILING. "HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW OUR
NATASHA. SHE DOESN'T DO SUCH THINGS. I MIGHT, BUT SHE WOULDN'T. SHE'S AS
MUCH A GENTLE CHICKEN-HEART AS YOU ARE, MY WICKED ALBERT -- IN HER OWN
WAY. BUT SHE WILL FORCE YOU TO GO ALONG WITH US."

 

  "WELL? HOW?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. I CAN NEVER QUITE MAKE OUT HOW SHE DOES IT. BUT SHE
MANAGES. YOU WILL SEE." HIS SMILE DEVELOPED A WOLFISH EDGE. AND WHEN
MORRISON SAW THAT SMILE, HE FINALLY REALIZED THERE WAS NO ESCAPE.

 

  26.

 

  THE NEXT MORNING MORRISON AND DEZHNEV RETURNED TO THE GROTTO. THEY
ENTERED A LARGE WINDOWLESS CEILING-LIT OFFICE, WHICH MORRISON HAD NOT
SEEN BEFORE. IT WAS CLEARLY NOT BORANOVA'S AND IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE,
AS ANYTHING WITH AN OSTENTATIOUS WASTE OF SPACE IS BOUND TO BE.

 

  BORANOVA SAT BEHIND A BULKY DESK AND ON THE WALL BEHIND HER WAS A
PORTRAIT OF THE SOVIET EXECUTIVE, LOOKING GRAVE. IN THE CORNER TO HER
LEFT WAS A WATER COOLER AND IN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT A MICROFILM CABINET.
ON THE DESK WAS A SMALL WORD PROCESSOR. THAT WAS ALL. THE ROOM WAS EMPTY
OTHERWISE.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "I HAVE BROUGHT HIM, YOU SEE. THE MISCHIEVOUS FELLOW
TRIED TO USE THE CHARMING PALERON TO EFFECT AN ESCAPE BY INTRIGUING WITH
THE GOVEMMENT BEHIND OUR BACK."

 

  "I HAVE RECEIVED THE REPORT," SAID BORANOVA QUIETLY. "PLEASE LEAVE,
ARKADY. I WISH TO BE ALONE WITH PROFESSOR ALBERT MORRISON."

 

  "IS THAT SAFE, NATASHA?"

 

  "I THINK SO. ALBERT IS NOT, IN MY OPINION, A MAN OF VIOLENCE. -- WILL
I BE SAFE, ALBERT?"

 

  MORRISON SPOKE FOR VIRTUALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY. "LET'S NOT PLAY
GAMES," HE SAID. "WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA GESTURED WITH HER HAND PEREMPTORILY AND DEZHNEV LEFT. WHEN
THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM, SHE SAID, "WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS? WHY HAVE
YOU TRIED TO INTRIGUE WITH SOMEONE YOU THOUGHT WAS AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT
WATCHING US? HAVE WE TREATED YOU SO BADLY?"

 

  "YES," SAID MORRISON ANGRILY, "YOU HAVE. WHY CAN'T ANY OF YOU GET IT
THROUGH YOUR HEAD THAT HIJACKING ME TO THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT SOMETHING
I AM LIKELY TO APPRECIATE? WHY DO YOU EXPECT GRATITUDE OF ME? BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T BREAK MY HEAD IN THE PROCESS? YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE -- IF
MY HEAD, UNBROKEN, HADN'T BEEN VALUABLE TO YOU."

 

  "IF YOUR HEAD, UNBROKEN, HADN'T BEEN VALUABLE TO US, WE WOULD HAVE
LEFT YOU IN PEACE. YOU KNOW THAT AND YOU KNOW THE NECESSITY THAT DROVE
US. WE HAVE EXPLAINED IT CAREFULLY. IF YOU WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO GET
AWAY, I WOULD UNDERSTAND, BUT YOUR METHOD OF ATTEMPTED ESCAPE MIGHT HAVE
DESTROYED OUR PROJECT AND PERHAPS US AS WELL -- IF YOU HAD SUCCEEDED.
YOU HOPED OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD DISAPPROVE OF OUR ACTIONS AND BE
APPALLED. IF THAT WERE SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO US?"

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TIGHTENED AND HE LOOKED SULLEN. "I COULD THINK OF NO
OTHER WAY OF ESCAPING. YOU SPEAK OF DRIVING NECESSITIES. MY NEEDS DRIVE
ME, TOO."

 

  "ALBERT, WE HAVE TRIED EVERY REASONABLE WAY TO PERSUADE YOU TO HELP
US. THERE HAS BEEN NO FORCE, NO THREATS OF FORCE, NO UNPLEASANTNESS OF
ANY KIND AFTER YOU HAD ARRIVED THERE. ISN'T THAT TRUE?"

 

  "I SUPPOSE SO."

 

  "YOU SUPPOSE SO? IT IS TRUE. BUT IT HAS ALL FAILED. YOU STILL REFUSE
TO HELP US, I THINK."

 

  "I STILL REFUSE AND I SHALL CONTINUE TO REFUSE."

 

  "THEN I AM FORCED, VERY MUCH AGAINST MY WILL, TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP."

 

  A BIT OF FEAR STIRRED WITHIN MORRISON AND HE FELT HIS HEART SKIP A
BEAT, BUT HE TRIED DESPERATELY TO SOUND DEFIANT, "WHICH IS?"

 

  "YOU WANT TO GET HOME, TO GO BACK TO AMERICA. VERY WELL, IF ALL OUR
PERSUASIVENESS FAILS, YOU SHALL RETURN."

 

  "ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

 

  "ARE YOU SURPRISED?"

 

  "YES, I'M SURPRISED, BUT I ACCEPT. I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. WHEN WILL
I LEAVE?"

 

  "THE VERY MOMENT WE SETTLE UPON THE STORY WE'RE GOING TO TELL."

 

  "WHERE'S THE PROBLEM? TELL THE TRUTH."

 

  "THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT, ALBERT. IT WOULD EMBARRASS MY
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE TO DENY HAVING GIVEN PERMISSION FOR MY
ACTION. I WOULD BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE FOR YOU
TO EXPECT ME TO DO THAT."

 

  "WHAT CAN YOU SAY INSTEAD?"

 

  "THAT YOU CAME HERE AT YOUR OWN REQUEST, IN ORDER TO HELP US WITH OUR
PROJECTS."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD VEHEMENTLY. "THAT WOULD BE AT LEAST AS
DIFFICULT FOR ME AS ADMITTING THE KIDNAPPING WOULD BE FOR YOU. THESE MAY
BE THE GOOD NEW DAYS, BUT OLD HABITS DIE HARD AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
WOULD BE MORE THAN A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF AN AMERICAN SCIENTIST WHO WENT
TO THE SOVIET UNION TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR PROJECTS. OLD COMPETITIONS
REMAIN AND I HAVE MY REPUTATION TO THINK OF."

 

  "YES, THERE IS THAT DIFFICULTY," ADMITTED BORANOVA, "BUT FROM MY POINT
OF VIEW, I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD THE DIFFICULTY THAN THAT I DID."

 

  "BUT I WON'T ALLOW IT. DO YOU SUPPOSE I WILL HESITATE TO TELL THE
TRUTH IN FULL DETAIL?"

 

  "BUT, ALBERT," SAID BORANOVA QUIETLY, "DO YOU SUPPOSE ANYONE WOULD
BELIEVE YOU?"

 

  "OF COURSE. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT YOU ASKED ME TO COME TO
THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT I REFUSED. I WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE KIDNAPPED TO
GET HERE."

 

  "I'M AFRAID YOUR AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT, ALBERT.
WOULD THEY WANT TO SAY THAT SOVIET AGENTS HAD PLUCKED AN AMERICAN OUT OF
HIS COMFORTABLE HOTEL ROOM AND CARRIED HIM OFF BY LAND, SEA, AND AIR
WITHOUT THE FORCES OF AMERICAN LAW BEING AWARE OF THIS? CONSIDERING
MODERN AMERICAN HIGH-TECH, OF WHICH YOUR PEOPLE ARE ALL SO PROUD, THAT
WOULD ARGUE EITHER INCOMPETENCE OR A LITTLE INSIDE TREASON ON THE PART
OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE. I THINK YOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE
WORLD BELIEVE YOU WENT TO THE SOVIET UNION VOLUNTARILY. -- BESIDES, THEY
WANTED YOU TO GO TO THE SOVIET UNION VOLUNTARILY, DIDN'T THEY?"

 

  MORRISON WAS SILENT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "OF COURSE THEY DID. THEY WANTED YOU TO FIND OUT AS
MUCH ABOUT MINIATURIZATION AS POSSIBLE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL
THEM YOU REFUSED TO BE MINIATURIZED. ALL YOU'LL BE ABLE TO REPORT WILL
BE THAT YOU WATCHED A RABBIT UNDERGO MINIATURIZATION, WHICH THEY WILL
CONSIDER TO HAVE BEEN A BIT OF FLIM-FLAM ON OUR PART. THEY WILL CONSIDER
THAT WE CAREFULLY HOODWINKED YOU AND YOU WILL HAVE FAILED THEM BADLY.
THEY WILL NOT FEEL BOUND TO SUPPORT YOU."

 

  MORRISON REVOLVED THE MATTER IN HIS MIND. HE SAID, "DO YOU REALLY
INTEND TO LEAVE ME IN THE POSITION OF BEING CONSIDERED A SPY AND A
TRAITOR BY MY PEOPLE? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO?"

 

  "NO, INDEED, ALBERT. WE WILL TELL ALL THE TRUTH WE CAN. IN FACT, WE
WOULD LIKE TO PROTECT YOU, EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOWED NO SIGNS OF WANTING TO
PROTECT US. WE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT OUR GREAT SCIENTIST PYOTR SHAPIROV IS
IN A COMA, THAT HE HAD SPOKEN HIGHLY OF YOUR NEUROPHYSICAL THEORIES
SHORTLY BEFORE THIS TRAGEDY HAD BEFALLEN HIM. WE THEREFORE CALLED ON YOU
AND ASKED YOU TO USE YOUR THEORIES AND YOUR EXPERTISE TO SEE IF YOU
COULD BRING HIM OUT OF HIS COMA. YOU CAN'T OBJECT TO THAT. IT WOULD HOLD
YOU UP TO THE WORLD AS A GREAT HUMANITARIAN. YOUR GOVERNMENT MIGHT WELL
SUPPORT THIS VIEW. IT WOULD CERTAINLY PROTECT THEM AGAINST POSSIBLE
EMBARRASSMENT -- AND OUR GOVERNMENT AS WELL. AND IT IS ALL ALMOST TRUE."

 

  "WHAT ABOUT THE MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "THAT IS THE ONE PLACE WHERE WE MUST AVOID THE TRUTH. WE CAN'T MENTION
THAT."

 

  "BUT WHAT WOULD KEEP ME FROM MENTIONING IT?"

 

  "THE FACT THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE YOU. DID YOU ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE
OF MINIATURIZATION UNTIL YOU SAW IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES? NOR WOULD YOUR
GOVERNMENT WANT TO SPREAD THE FEELING THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAS ATTAINED
MINIATURIZATION. THEY WOULD NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY WERE CERTAIN THE SOVIET UNION HAD THE PROCESS
AND, BETTER YET, THAT THEY HAD THE PROCESS AS WELL. -- BUT THERE YOU
ARE, ALBERT. WE WILL SEND YOU HOME WITH AN INNOCUOUS STORY THAT DOESN'T
MENTION MINIATURIZATION, DOESN'T EMBARRASS EITHER MY COUNTRY OR YOURS,
AND RELIEVES YOU OF ANY SUSPICION OF BEING A TRAITOR. ARE YOU
SATISFIED?"

 

  MORRISON STARED AT BORANOVA UNCERTAINLY AND RUBBED HIS THIN SANDY HAIR
TILL IT STOOD LIP IN VAGUE TUFTS. "BUT WHY WILL YOU SAY YOU ARE SENDING
ME BACK? THAT HAS TO BE EXPLAINED, TOO. YOU CAN'T VERY WELL SAY THAT
SHAPIROV RECOVERED WITH MY HELP UNLESS HE ACTUALLY RECOVERS SO THAT YOU
CAN PRODUCE HIM. NOR CAN YOU SAY THAT HE DIED BEFORE I COULD GET TO HIM
UNLESS HE ACTUALLY DOES DIE SOON, AS OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN
WHY HE IS STILL IN A COMA OR WHY, PERHAPS, HE HAS COME BACK TO LIFE. YOU
CAN'T HIDE THE SITUATION FOREVER."

 

  "THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT WORRIES US, ALBERT, AND IT IS CLEVER OF YOU TO
SEE IT. AFTER ALL, WE ARE SENDING YOU BACK WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF YOUR
ARRIVAL -- AND WHY? THE ONLY LOGICAL REASON, I'M AFRAID, IS THAT WE HAVE
FOUND YOU TO BE A CHARLATAN. WE BROUGHT YOU HERE IN HIGH HOPES FOR OUR
POOR SHAPIROV, BUT IN NO TIME AT ALL IT TURNED OUT THAT YOUR VIEWS WERE
INCOHERENT NONSENSE AND, WITH BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT, WE SENT YOU BACK.
THAT WILL DO YOU NO HARM, ALBERT. BEING A CHARLATAN IS NOT THE SAME AS
BEING A SPY."

 

  "DON'T PLAY THE INNOCENT, NATALYA. YOU CAN'T DO THAT." HE HAD TURNED
WHITE WITH ANGER.

 

  "BUT IT MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT? YOUR OWN PEERS DON'T TAKE YOU
SERIOUSLY. THEY LAUGH AT YOUR VIEWS. THEY WOULD AGREE WITH US THAT YOUR
NEUROPHYSICAL SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOHERENT NONSENSE. WE'D BE A LITTLE
EMBARRASSED FOR HAVING BEEN SO CREDULOUS AS TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY, BUT
IT WAS REALLY SHAPIROV WHO THOUGHT HIGHLY OF YOU AND HE WAS, UNBEKNOWN
TO US, ON THE EDGE OF A STROKE AND TOTAL MENTAL BREAKDOWN, SO THAT ONE
COULD SCARCELY BLAME HIM FOR HIS MAD ADMIRATION OF YOU."

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TREMBLED. "BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A CLOWN OUT OF ME. YOU
CAN'T RUIN MY REPUTATION SO."

 

  "BUT WHAT REPUTATION ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, ALBERT? YOUR WIFE HAS LEFT
YOU AND SOME PEOPLE THINK IT WAS BECAUSE HAVING YOUR CAREER FOUNDER ON
YOUR MAD IDEAS WAS THE LAST STRAW FOR HER. WE HAVE HEARD THAT YOUR
APPOINTMENT IS NOT TO BE RENEWED AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT MANAGED TO FIND
ANOTHER PLACE. YOU ARE FINISHED AS A SCIENTIST IN ANY CASE AND THIS
STORY OF OURS WOULD MERELY CONFLRM WHAT ALREADY EXISTS. PERHAPS YOU CAN
FIND SOME OTHER WAY OF MAKING A LIVING -- OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE. YOU WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE HAD TO DO THAT ANYWAY, EVEN IF WE HAD NEVER TOUCHED YOU.
THERE'S THAT CONSOLATION."

 

  "BUT YOU'RE LYING AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE LYING, NATALYA. HAVE YOU NO CODE
OF ETHICS? CAN A RESPECTABLE SCIENTIST DO THIS TO AN HONORABLE BROTHER
SCIENTIST?"

 

  "YOU WERE UNMOVED BY ABSTRACTIONS YESTERDAY, ALBERT, AND I AM UNMOVED
BY THEM TODAY IN CONSEQUENCE."

 

  "SOMEDAY SCIENTISTS WILL DISCOVER I WAS RIGHT. HOW WILL YOU LOOK
THEN?"

 

  "WE MAY ALL BE DEAD BY THEN. BESIDES, YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE
WAY IT WORKS. FRANZ ANTON MESMER, THOUGH HE DISCOVERED HYPNOTISM, WAS
CONSIDERED A FRAUD AND A CHARLATAN. WHEN JAMES BRAID REDISCOVERED
HYPNOTISM, HE GOT THE CREDIT AND MESMER WAS STILL CONSIDERED A FRAUD AND
CHARLATAN. BESIDES-ARE WE TRULY LYING WHEN WE CALL YOU A CHARLATAN?"

 

  "OF COURSE YOU ARE!"

 

  "LET'S REASON IT OUT. WHY DO YOU REFUSE TO VENTURE INTO AN EXPERIMENT
OF MINIATURIZATION WHICH MAY ENABLE YOU TO ESTABLISH YOUR THEORIES AND
WHICH IS LIKELY TO INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BRAIN BY WHOLE ORDERS
OF MAGNITUDE? SUCH REFUSAL CAN ONLY ARISE THROUGH YOUR OWN CERTAIN
KNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR THEORIES ARE WRONG, THAT YOU ARE EITHER A FOOL OR A
FRAUD OR BOTH, AND THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS ESTABLISHED BEYOND A DOUBT,
AS IT WOULD BE IF YOU SUBJECTED YOURSELF TO MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "THAT IS NOT SO."

 

  "DO YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU REFUSE MINIATURIZATION SIMPLY
BECAUSE YOU ARE FRIGHTENED? THAT YOU TURN DOWN A CHANCE AT KNOWLEDGE,
GLORY, FAME, VICTORY, VINDICATION AFTER YEARS OF SCORN -- ALL BECAUSE
YOU ARE SCARED? COME, WE CAN'T THINK SO LITTLE OF YOU, ALBERT. IT MAKES
MUCH MORE SENSE TO BELIEVE YOU ARE A FRAUD AND SO WE WILL HAVE NO
HESITATION IN SAYING YOU ARE."

 

  "AMERICANS WON'T BELIEVE A SOVIET LIBEL AGAINST AN AMERICAN
SCIENTIST."

 

  "OH, ALBERT, OF COURSE THEY WILL. WHEN WE RELEASE YOU, WITH OUR
EXPLANATION, IT WILL BE IN ALL YOUR AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS AT ONCE. THEY
WILL BE FULL OF IT. THEY ARE THE MOST ENTERPRISING IN THE WORLD AND THE
FREEST, AS YOU ARE ALL SO FOND OF SAYING, MEANING THEY ARE A LAW UNTO
THEMSELVES. THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON IT AND NEVER TIRE OF FLAUNTING THAT
IN THE EYES OF OUR OWN MORE SEDATE PRESS. THIS WILL BE SUCH A LOVELY
STORY FOR THEM: 'AMERICAN FAKER FOOLS STUPID SOVIETS.' I CAN SEE THE
HEADLINES NOW. IN FACT, ALBERT, YOU MAY MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON
YOUR AMERICAN LECTURE CIRCUIT. YOU KNOW: 'HOW I MADE JERKS OF THE
SOVIETS.' THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM ALL THE RIDICULOUS THINGS YOU PERSUADED
US TO BELIEVE BEFORE WE CAUGHT ON TO YOU AND THE AUDIENCES WILL LAUGH
THEMSELVES INTO HYSTERICS."

 

  MORRISON SAID IN A WHISPER, "NATALYA, WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME?"

 

  "I? I AM DOING NOTHING. YOU ARE DOING IT. YOU WANT TO GO HOME AND
SINCE WE'VE FAILED TO GET YOU TO ACCEPT MINIATURIZATION, WE HAVE NO
CHOICE BUT TO AGREE. ONCE, THOUGH, WE AGREE TO SEND YOU HOME, THEN, STEP
BY STEP, EVERYTHING ELSE MUST LOGICALLY FOLLOW."

 

  "BUT IN THAT CASE, I CAN'T GO HOME. I CAN'T HAVE MY LIFE DESTROYED
BEYOND REPAIR."

 

  "BUT WHO WOULD CARE, ALBERT? YOUR ESTRANGED WIFE? YOUR CHILDREN, WHO
NO LONGER KNOW YOU AND CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THEIR NAMES ANYWAY? YOUR
UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS FIRING YOU? YOUR COLLEAGUES, WHO LAUGH AT YOU? YOUR
GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS ABANDONED YOU? TAKE HEART. NO ONE WOULD CARE. AN
INITIAL RAUCOUS LAUGH ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THEN YOU WOULD BE
FORGOTTEN FOREVER. YOU'LL DIE WITHOUT AN OBITUARY NOTICE EVENTUALLY,
EXCEPT FOR THOSE PAPERS WHO MIGHT NOT OBJECT TO THE TASTELESSNESS OF
BRINGING BACK THAT OLD JOKE FOR ONE MORE SPURT OF LAUGHTER TO FOLLOW YOU
TO YOUR GRAVE."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DESPAIR. "I CAN'T GO HOME."

 

  "BUT YOU MUST. UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP US, WHICH YOU'RE NOT,
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE."

 

  "BUT I CAN'T GO HOME ON YOUR TERMS."

 

  "BUT WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE?"

 

  MORRISON STARED AT THE WOMAN, WHO WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH SUCH MILD
CONCERN. HE WHISPERED, "I ACCEPT THE ALTERNATIVE."

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AT HIM FOR A LONG MINUTE. "I DO NOT WISH TO BE
MISTAKEN, ALBERT. PUT YOUR AGREEMENT INTO CLEAR LANGUAGE."

 

  "IT'S EITHER CONSENT TO BE MINIATURIZED OR CONSENT TO BE DESTROYED.
ISN'T THAT IT?"

 

  BORANOVA THRUST OUT HER LIPS. "THAT'S A HARSH WAY OF PUTTING IT. I
PREFER THAT YOU LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. EITHER YOU AGREE TO HELP US BY NOON
OR YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE TO THE UNITED STATES BY 2 P.M. WHAT DO YOU
SAY? IT IS NOW NEARLY 11 A.M. YOU HAVE OVER AN HOUR TO DECIDE."

 

  "WHAT'S THE USE? AN HOUR WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. I'LL BE MINIATURIZED."

 

  "WE WILL BE MINIATURIZED. YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE." BORANOVA REACHED OUT
AND TOUCHED A CONTACT ON HER DESK.

 

  DEZHNEV ENTERED. "WELL, ALBERT. YOU STAND THERE LOOKING SO SAD, SO
CRUMPLED, THAT IT STRIKES ME YOU HAVE DECIDED TO HELP US."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU NEED MAKE NO SARDONIC REMARKS. ALBERT WILL HELP US
AND WE WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR HIS HELP. HIS DECISION WAS A VOLUNTARY ONE."

 

  "I'M SURE IT WAS," SAID DEZHNEV. "HOW YOU SQUEEZED IT OUT THIS TIME,
NATASHA, I CAN'T SAY, BUT I KNEW YOU WOULD. -- AND I MUST CONTRATULATE
YOU, TOO, ALBERT. IT TOOK HER QUITE A BIT LONGER THAN I THOUGHT IT
WOULD."

 

  MORRISON COULD ONLY STARE AT THE TWO VACANTLY. HE FELT AS THOUGH HE
HAD SWALLOWED AN ICICLE WHOLE -- ONE THAT DIDN'T MELT BUT THAT, INSTEAD,
REDUCED THE TEMPERATURE OF HIS ABDOMEN TO THE FREEZING POINT.

 

  CERTAINLY, HE WAS SHIVERING.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 7 -- SHIP

 

  NO VOYAGE IS DANGEROUS TO THE ONE WHO WAVES GOOD-BYE FROM THE SHORE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  27.

 

  MORRISON FELT NUMB ALL THROUGH LUNCH AND YET IN A WAY THE PRESSURE WAS
OFF. THERE WERE NO DETERMINED VOICES PRESSING ON HIM, NO INTENSITY OF
EXPLANATIONS AND PERSUASIONS, NO SMILES OF INTENT, NO HEADS CLOSING IN.

 

  OF COURSE, THEY MADE IT QUITE CLEAR, IN A COOL BUSINESSLIKE WAY, THAT
HE WOULD NO LONGER LEAVE THE GROTTO TILL THE DEED WAS DONE AND THAT FROM
THE GROTTO THERE WAS, OF COURSE, NO ESCAPE.

 

  AND THEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A THOUGHT SWIRLED INTO HIS MIND. HE HAD
ACTUALLY AGREED TO BE MINIATURIZED!

 

  THEY TOOK HIM TO A ROOM OF HIS OWN IN THE GROTTO WHERE HE COULD VIEW
BOOK-FILMS THROUGH A VIEWER PROVIDED FOR HIS PERSONAL USE -- EVEN
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BOOK-FILMS IF HE WANTED THE INNER FAMILIARITY OF HOME
TO PASS THE NEXT FEW HOURS. SO HE SAT THERE WITH A BOOK-FILM UNREELING
THROUGH THE VIEWER STRAPPED ON HIS EYES AND SOMEHOW IT LEFT HIS MIND
TOTALLY UNTOUCHED.

 

  HE HAD ACTUALLY AGREED TO BE MINIATURIZED!

 

  HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT HE COULD DO AS HE PLEASED UNTIL SOMEONE CAME FOR
HIM. HE COULD DO AS HE PLEASED, THAT IS, PROVIDED HE DID NOT PLEASE TO
LEAVE. THERE WERE GUARDS EVERYWHERE.

 

  THE FEELING OF TERROR HAD, MORRISON WAS AWARE, MUCH DIMINISHED. THAT
WAS THE USE OF NUMBNESS AND, OF COURSE, THE MORE ONE REPEATS A SENTENCE
IN ONE'S MIND, THE MORE IT LOSES MEANING. HE HAD ACTUALLY AGREED TO BE
MINIATURIZED, THE MORE IT RANG IN HIS MIND LIKE THE TOLLING OF A BELL,
OVER AND OVER, THE MORE THE HORROR OF IT FADED. AND LEFT A MERE VACUUM
OF NON-SENSATION IN ITS PLACE.

 

  HE WAS DISTANTLY AWARE THAT THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM HAD OPENED. SOMEONE,
HE PRESUMED DULLY, HAD COME FOR HIM. HE REMOVED HIS VIEWER, LIFTED HIS
EYES LANGUIDLY, AND, FOR JUST A MOMENT, FELT A MILD SPARK OF INTEREST.

 

  IT WAS SOPHIA KALIININ, LOOKING BEAUTIFUL EVEN TO HIS BLEARED SENSES.
SHE SAID IN ENGLISH, "A GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU, GENTLEMAN."

 

  HE GRIMACED SLIGHTLY. HE WOULD RATHER HEAR RUSSIAN THAN ENGLISH
DELIVERED WITH QUITE SO DISTORTED AN ACCENT.

 

  HE SAID SULLENLY IN RUSSIAN, "PLEASE SPEAK IN RUSSIAN, SOPHIA."

 

  HIS RUSSIAN MIGHT BE AS DISTRESSING TO HER, FOR ALL HE KNEW, AS HER
ENGLISH WAS TO HIM, BUT HE DIDN'T CARE. HE WAS HERE BY THEIR DOING AND
IF HIS SHORTCOMINGS TROUBLED THEM, THAT WAS THEIR DOING, TOO.

 

  SHE SHRUGGED SLIGHTLY AND SAID IN RUSSIAN, "CERTAINLY -- IF THAT IS
WHAT PLEASES YOU."

 

  THEN SHE STARED AT HIM FOR A THOUGHTFUL WHILE. HE MET THAT STARE
EASILY ENOUGH FOR, AT THE MOMENT, HE DID NOT MUCH CARE WHAT HE DID AND
LOOKING AT HER WAS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT TO HIM THAN LOOKING AT SOMETHING
ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- OR LOOKING AT NOTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE
MOMENTARY IMPRESSION OF BEAUTY THAT HAD COME WITH HER ENTRANCE HAD
FADED.

 

  SHE SAID FINALLY, "I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NOW AGREED TO ACCOMPANY
US ON OUR VENTURE."

 

  "YES, I HAVE."

 

  "THAT IS GOOD OF YOU. WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL. IN ALL HONESTY, I DID NOT
THINK YOU WOULD DO SO, SINCE YOU ARE AN AMERICAN. I APOLOGIZE."

 

  MORRISON SAID WITH A FAR-OFF TOUCH OF REGRET AND ANGER, "THE DECISION
TO HELP YOU WAS NOT VOLUNTARY. I WAS PERSUADED -- BY AN EXPERT."

 

  "BY NATALYA BORANOVA?"

 

  MORRISON NODDED.

 

  "SHE IS VERY GOOD AT PERSUADING," SAID KALIININ. "NOT VERY KIND,
USUALLY, BUT VERY GOOD. I, TOO, REQUIRED PERSUASION."

 

  "WHY YOU?" SAID MORRISON.

 

  "I HAD OTHER REASONS -- ONES THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME."

 

  "INDEED? WHAT WERE THEY?"

 

  "BUT UNIMPORTANT TO YOU."

 

  THERE WAS A SHORT UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE.

 

  "COME, THE TASK I HAVE BEEN GIVEN IS TO SHOW YOU THE SHIP," SAID
KALIININ.

 

  "THE SHIP? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLANNING THIS? HAVE YOU HAD TIME TO
BUILD A SHIP?"

 

  "FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF TESTING SHAPIROV'S BRAIN FROM WITHIN? OF
COURSE NOT. IT WAS MEANT FOR OTHER, SIMPLER PURPOSES, BUT IT IS THE ONLY
THING WE HAVE THAT WE CAN USE. -- COME, ALBERT, NATALYA THINKS IT WILL
BE WISE FOR YOU TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT, SEE IT, FEEL IT. IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT THE DOWN-TO-EARTHNESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY WILL RECONCILE YOU
TO THE TASK."

 

  MORRISON HELD BACK. "WHY MUST I SEE IT NOW? CAN'T I HAVE TIME TO GROW
ACCUSTOMED TO THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF PERSONAL MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "THAT IS FOOLISH, ALBERT. IF YOU HAD MORE TIME TO SIT IN YOUR ROOM AND
BROOD, YOU WOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO FEED YOUR UNCERTAINTY. BESIDES, WE
HAVE NO TIME. HOW LONG DO YOU SUPPOSE WE CAN ALLOW SHAPIROV TO LIE THERE
DETERIORATING, WITH HIS THOUGHTS DIMINISHING WITH EACH MOMENT? THE SHIP
EMBARKS ON ITS JOURNEY TOMORROW MORNING."

 

  "TOMORROW MORNING," MUTTERED MORRISON, HIS THROAT DRY. FOOLISHLY, HE
LOOKED AT HIS WATCH.

 

  "YOU HAVE FEW ENOUGH HOURS, BUT WE'LL KEEP TRACK OF THE TIME FOR YOU
SO YOU NEED NOT CONSULT YOUR WATCH. TOMORROW MORNING THE SHIP ENTERS A
HUMAN BODY. AND YOU WILL BE ON THE SHIP."

 

  THEN, WITHOUT WARNING, SHE SLAPPED HIS CHEEK HARD. SHE SAID, "YOUR
EYES WERE BEGINNING TO TURN UPWARD. WERE YOU PLANNING TO FAINT?"

 

  MORRISON RUBBED HIS CHEEK, GRIMACING WITH PAIN. "I WASN'T PLANNING
ANYTHING," HE MUMBLED, "BUT I MIGHT HAVE FAINTED WITHOUT PLANNING IT.
HAVE YOU NO GENTLER WAY OF BREAKING THE NEWS?"

 

  "HAVE I REALLY CAUGHT YOU BY SURPRISE, WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE AGREED TO BE MINIATURIZED AND IT IS SELF-EVIDENT THAT WE HAVE NO
TIME?"

 

  SHE GESTURED PEREMPTORILY, "NOW COME WITH ME."

 

  AND MORRISON, STILL RUBBING HIS CHEEK AND SEETHING WITH RAGE AND
HUMILIATION, FOLLOWED.

 

  28.

 

  IT WAS BACK TO THE MINIATURIZATION AREA -- BACK TO THE BUSY PEOPLE,
EACH CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND PAYING NO ATTENTION TO ONE
ANOTHER. THROUGH THEM ALL, KALIININ WALKED WITH AN ERECT CARRIAGE AND
MAINTAINED THE ARISTOCRATIC AIR THAT ARISES AUTOMATICALLY WHEN ALL DEFER
TO YOU.

 

  SHE WAS ONE OF THE LEADING LIGHTS, MORRISON COULD SEE (HIS HAND STILL
RESTING LIGHTLY ON HIS CHEEK, WHICH FELT INFLAMED AND WHICH HE HESITATED
TO EXPOSE), AND ALL WHO CROSSED OR EVEN NEARED HER PATH NODDED THEIR
HEADS IN A KIND OF RUDIMENTARY BOW AND STEPPED A LITTLE BACKWARD, AS
THOUGH TO MAKE SURE NOT TO IMPEDE HER PATCH. NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGED
MORRISON'S PRESENCE AT ALL.

 

  ON, ON, THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER -- AND EVERYWHERE THE FEEL OF
PENT-UP ENERGY HELD IN BARE CHECK.

 

  KALIININ MUST HAVE SENSED IT TOO, FAMILIAR AS SHE MUST BE WITH IT, FOR
SHE MUTTERED TO MORRISON WITH A CERTAIN PRIDE, "THERE'S A SOLAR POWER
STATION IN SPACE, A MAJOR PART OF WHOSE OUTPUT IS RESERVED FOR
MALENKIGRAD."

 

  AND THEN THEY WERE UPON IT BEFORE MORRISON HAD A TRUE CHANCE TO
REALIZE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT. IT WAS NOT A VERY LARGE ROOM AND THE
OBJECT WITHIN IT WAS NOT OF IMPRESSIVE BULK. INDEED, MORRISON'S FIRST
IMPRESSION WAS THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF ARTWORK.

 

  IT WAS A STREAMLINED OBJECT NOT MUCH LARGER THAN AN AUTOMOBILE,
CERTAINLY SHORTER THAN A STRETCH LIMOUSINE, THOUGH TALLER. AND IT WAS
TRANSPARENT!

 

  AUTOMATICALLY, MORRISON REACHED OUT TO FEEL IT.

 

  IT WAS NOT COLD TO THE TOUCH. IT FELT SMOOTH AND ALMOST MOIST, BUT
WHEN HE REMOVED HIS HAND, HIS FINGERTIPS WERE PERFECTLY DRY. HE TRIED IT
AGAIN AND AS HE RAN HIS FINGERTIPS ACROSS THE SURFACE, THEY SEEMED TO
STICK SLIGHTLY, BUT THEY LEFT NO SWEATY MARK. ON IMPULSE, HE BREATHED
UPON IT. THERE WAS THE SHADOW OF CONDENSING MOISTURE ON THE TRANSPARENT
MATERIAL, BUT IT DISAPPEARED QUICKLY.

 

  "IT IS A PLASTIC MATERIAL," SAID KALIININ, "BUT I DON'T KNOW ITS
COMPOSITION. IF I KNEW, IT WOULD PROBABLY COME UNDER THE HEAD OF
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ANYWAY, BUT WHATEVER IT IS, IT IS STRONGER THAN
STEEL -- TOUGHER AND MORE RESISTANT TO SHOCK -- KILOGRAM FOR KILOGRAM."

 

  "WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT, PERHAPS," SAID MORRISON, FOR THE MOMENT HIS
SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY DROWNING HIS UNEASINESS, "BUT SUCH A THICKNESS OF
PLASTIC MATERIAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AS STRONG AS THE SAME THICKNESS
OF STEEL. IT COULD NOT BE AS STRONG, VOLUME FOR VOLUME."

 

  "YES, BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING?" SAID KALIININ. "THERE WILL BE NO
PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SHIP; THERE WILL BE NO
METEROIDS OR EVEN COSMIC DUST AGAINST WHICH WE MUST PROTECT OURSELVES.
THERE WILL BE ABOUT US NOTHING BUT SOFT CELL STRUCTURE. THIS PLASTIC
WILL BE AMPLE PROTECTION AND IT IS LIGHT. THE TWO OF US COULD PERHAPS
LIFT IT IF WE TRIED. THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT. AS YOU CAN WELL
UNDERSTAND, WE MUST BE SPARING OF MASS. EVERY ADDITIONAL KILOGRAM
CONSUMES CONSIDERABLE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY IN MINIATURIZATION AND
DELIVERS CONSIDERABLE HEAT IN DEMINIATURIZATION."

 

  "WILL IT HOLD A LARGE ENOUGH CREW?" SAID MORRISON, PEERING INSIDE.

 

  "IT WILL. IT IS VERY COMPACT, BUT IT CAN HOLD SIX AND WE WILL ONLY BE
FIVE. AND IT CONTAINS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF UNUSUAL GADGETRY. NOT AS
MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE, OF COURSE. THE ORIGINAL PLANS -- BUT WHAT CAN WE
DO? THERE ARE ALWAYS PRESSURES FOR ECONOMY, EVEN UNWARRANTED ONES, IN
THIS UNJUST WORLD."

 

  MORRISON SAID WITH A TWINGE OF STRONG UNEASINESS, "HOW MUCH PRESSURE
FOR HOW MUCH ECONOMY? DOES EVERYTHING WORK?"

 

  "I ASSURE YOU IT DOES." HER FACE HAD LIT UP. NOW THAT THE SETTLED
MELANCHOLY HAD LEFT (TEMPORARILY ONLY, MORRISON FELT SURE), KALIININ WAS
UNMISTAKABLY GOOD-LOOKING. "EVERYTHING IN IT HAS BEEN TESTED
EXHAUSTIVELY, BOTH SINGLY AND ALL TOGETHER. ZERO RISK IS IMPOSSIBLE OF
ATTAINMENT, BUT WE HAVE A REASONABLY CLOSE TO ZERO RISK HERE. AND ALL
WITH VIRTUALLY NO METAL. WHAT WITH MICROCHIPS, FIBER OPTICS, AND
MANUILSKY JUNCTIONS, WE HAVE ALL WE WANT IN A TOTAL OF LESS THAN FIVE
KILOGRAMS OF DEVICES ALL TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY THE SHIP CAN BE SO SMALL.
AFTER ALL, VOYAGES INTO THE MICROCOSM ARE NOT EXPECTED TO LAST FOR MORE
THAN SOME HOURS, SO WE DON'T NEED SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS, CYCLING
EQUIPMENT, ELABORATE FOOD AND AIR SUPPLIES, ANYTHING OTHER THAN QUITE
SIMPLE DEVICES FOR EXCRETORY FUNCTIONS, AND SO ON."

 

  "WHO'LL BE AT THE CONTROLS?"

 

  "ARKADY."

 

  "ARKADY DEZHNEV?"

 

  "YOU SEEM SURPRISED."

 

  "I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD. I PRESUME HE'S QUALIFIED."

 

  "COMPLETELY. HE'S IN ENGINEERING DESIGN AND HE'S A GENIUS AT IT. YOU
CAN'T GO BY THE WAY HE SOUNDS -- NO, YOU CAN GO BY THE WAY HE SOUNDS. DO
YOU SUPPOSE ANY OF US COULD ENDURE HIS CRUDE HUMOR AND AFFECTATIONS IF
HE WEREN'T A GENIUS AT SOMETHING? HE DESIGNED THE SHIP -- EVERY PART OF
IT -- AND ALL ITS EQUIPMENT. HE INVENTED A DOZEN COMPLETELY NEW WAYS OF
LOWERING MASS AND INTRODUCING COMPACTNESS. YOU HAVE NOTHING LIKE IT IN
THE UNITED STATES."

 

  MORRISON SAID STIFFLY, "I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT THE UNITED
STATES MAY HAVE OR MAY NOT HAVE IN UNUSUAL DEVICES."

 

  "I AM SURE THEY DON'T. DEZHNEV IS AN UNUSUAL PERSON, FOR ALL HIS LOVE
OF PRESENTING HIMSELF AS A BOOR. HE IS A DESCENDANT OF SEMYON IVANOV
DEZHNEV. YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM, I SUPPOSE."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD.

 

  "REALLY?" KALIININ'S VOICE TURNED ICY. "HE IS ONLY THE FAMOUS EXPLORER
WHO, IN THE TIME OF PETER THE GREAT, EXPLORED SIBERIA TO ITS EASTERNMOST
CENTIMETER AND SAID THERE WAS A STRETCH OF SEA SEPARATING SIBERIA AND
NORTH AMERICA DECADES BEFORE VITUS BERING, A DANE IN RUSSIAN EMPLOY,
DISCOVERED THE BERING STRAIT. -- AND YOU DON'T KNOW DEZHNEV. THAT'S SO
AMERICAN. UNLESS A WESTERNER DID IT, YOU NEVER HEARD OF IT."

 

  "DON'T SEE INSULTS EVERYWHERE, SOPHIA. I HAVEN'T STUDIED EXPLORATION.
THERE ARE MANY AMERICAN EXPLORERS THAT I DON'T KNOW -- AND THAT YOU
DON'T, EITHER." HE SHOOK HIS FINGER AT HER, AGAIN REMEMBERING HER SLAP
AND RUBBING HIS CHECK ONCE MORE, "THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. YOU FIND THINGS
TO FEED HATE ON -- INCONSEQUENTIAL THINGS YOU SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED TO
GRUB UP."

 

  "SEMYON DEZHNEV WAS A GREAT EXPLORER -- AND NOT INCONSEQUENTIAL."

 

  "I'M WILLING TO ADMIT THAT. I AM GLAD TO LEARN OF HIM AND I MARVEL AT
HIS ACHIEVEMENT. BUT MY NOT HAVING HEARD OF HIM IS NOT A FIT OCCASION
FOR SOVIET-AMERICAN RIVALRY. BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!"

 

  KALIININ'S EYES FELL, THEN LIFTED TO HIS CHEEK. (HAD SHE LEFT A BRUISE
THERE? MORRISON WONDERED.) SHE SAID, "I'M SORRY I STRUCK YOU, ALBERT. IT
NEED NOT HAVE BEEN THAT HARD, BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FAINT. AT THAT
MOMENT, I FELT I WOULD HAVE NO PATIENCE TO DEAL WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS
AMERICAN. I DID LET UNJUSTIFIED ANGER GUIDE ME."

 

  "I'LL GRANT YOU MEANT WELL, BUT I, TOO, WISH YOU HAD NOT STRUCK SO
HARD. STILL, I WILL ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY."

 

  "THEN LET US GET INTO THE SHIP,"

 

  MORRISON MANAGED A SMILE. SOMEHOW HE FELT A LITTLE BETTER DEALING WITH
KALIININ THAN HE WOULD HAVE WITH DEZHNEV OR KONEV -- OR EVEN BORANOVA. A
PRETTY WOMAN, STILL QUITE YOUNG, DOES SOMEHOW DISTRACT A MAN'S MIND FROM
HIS TROUBLES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN MOST THINGS WOULD. HE SAID, "AREN'T
YOU AFRAID I MIGHT TRY TO SABOTAGE IT?"

 

  KALIININ PAUSED. "ACTUALLY, I'M NOT. I SUSPECT YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESPECT
FOR A VESSEL OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION TO AVOID DOING IT ANY DAMAGE
WHATEVER. BESIDES -- AND I SAY THIS SERIOUSLY, ALBERT -- THE LAWS
AGAINST SABOTAGE ARE EXCESSIVELY SEVERE IN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE
SLIGHTEST MISTAKE IN HANDLING ANYTHING IN THE SHIP WILL SET OFF AN ALARM
THAT WILL HAVE GUARDS HERE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. WE HAVE STRICT LAWS
AGAINST GUARDS BEATING UP SABOTEURS, BUT SOMETIMES THEY TEND TO FORGET
THEMSELVES IN THEIR INDIGNATION. PLEASE DON'T EVEN THINK OF TOUCHING
ANYTHING."

 

  SHE PUT A HAND ON THE HULL AS SHE SPOKE AND PRESUMABLY CLOSED A
CONTACT, THOUGH MORRISON DIDN'T SEE HOW IT WAS DONE. A DOOR -- A
RECTANGLE CURVED AT THE EDGE -- OPENED. (THE DOOR'S OWN EDGE SEEMED TO
BE DOUBLE. WOULD IT ALSO ACT AS AN AIR LOCK?)

 

  THE OPENING WAS COMPACT. KALIININ, ENTERING FIRST, HAD TO STOOP. SHE
HELD OUT A HAND TO MORRISON. "CAREFUL, ALBERT."

 

  MORRISON NOT ONLY STOOPED, BUT TURNED SIDEWAYS. ONCE INSIDE THE SHIP,
HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT QUITE STAND UPRIGHT. WHEN HE BUMPED HIS HEAD
GENTLY, HE LOOKED UP AT THE CEILING, STARTLED.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "WE'LL BE DOING OUR WORK SITTING DOWN FOR THE MOST
PART, SO DON'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CEILING."

 

  "I DON'T THINK CLAUSTROPHOBES WOULD LIKE THIS."

 

  "ARE YOU CLAUSTROPHOBIC?"

 

  "NO."

 

  KALIININ NODDED HER RELIEF. "THAT'S GOOD. WE HAVE TO SAVE SPACE, YOU
KNOW. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?"

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND. THERE WERE SIX SEATS, IN PAIRS. HE SAT DOWN IN
THE ONE NEAREST THE DOOR AND SAID, "THESE ARE NOT EXACTLY ROOMY,
EITHER."

 

  "NO," ADMITTED KALIININ. "WEIGHT LIFTERS COULD NOT BE ACCOMMODATED."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "OBVIOUSLY, THIS SHIP WAS BUILT LONG BEFORE SHAPIROV
WENT INTO HIS COMA."

 

  "OF COURSE. WE'VE BEEN PLANNING TO HAVE MINIATURIZED PERSONNEL INVADE
LIVING TISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY IF WE WISHED TO
MAKE TRULY IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES. NATURALLY, WE EXPECTED THAT
WE WOULD WORK WITH ANIMALS AT THE START AND STUDY THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
IN FINE DETAIL. IT IS FOR THAT PROJECT THAT THIS SHIP WAS BUILT. NO ONE
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE GUESSED THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO CARRY OUT THE
FIRST SUCH MICROVOYAGE, THE SUBJECT WOULD NOT ONLY BE A HUMAN BODY BUT
SHAPIROV HIMSELF."

 

  MORRISON WAS STILL STUDYING THE INTERIOR OF THE SHIP. IT SEEMED BARE.
DETAIL WAS SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT IN THE SITUATION OF
TRANSPARENCY-ON-TRANSPARENCY AND MINIATURIZATION OF THE OLD-TYPE --
ORDINARY, BUT MICROSCOPIC -- COMPONENTS.

 

  HE SAID, "THERE WILL BE FIVE ON THE SHIP: YOU AND I, BORANOVA, KONEV,
AND DEZHNEV."

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT."

 

  "AND WHAT WILL EACH OF US BE DOING?"

 

  "ARKADY WILL CONTROL THE SHIP. OBVIOUSLY, HE KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT.
IT'S THE CHILD OF HIS HANDS AND MIND. HE'LL BE IN THE LEFT FRONT SEAT.
TO HIS RIGHT WILL BE THE OTHER MALE, WHO HAS A COMPLETE MAP OF THE
NEUROCIRCULATORY PATTERN OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN. HE WILL BE THE PILOT. I
WILL SIT BEHIND ARKADY AND I WILL CONTROL THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERN OF
THE SHIP'S SURFACE."

 

  "AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERN? WHAT'S THAT FOR?"

 

  "MY DEAR ALBERT. YOU RECOGNIZE OBJECTS BY REFLECTED LIGHT, A DOG
RECOGNIZES OBJECTS BY EMITTED ODOR, A MOLECULE RECOGNIZES OBJECTS BY
SURFACE ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERN. IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY AS A
MINIATURIZED OBJECT AMONG MOLECULES, WE MUST HAVE THE PROPER PATTERNS IN
ORDER TO BE TREATED AS FRIENDS RATHER THAN FOES."

 

  "THAT SOUNDS COMPLICATED."

 

  "IT IS -- BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE MY LIFE STUDY. NATALYA WILL SIT BEHIND
ME. SHE WILL BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE EXPEDITION. SHE WILL MAKE THE
DECISIONS."

 

  "WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS?"

 

  "WHATEVER KIND ARE NECESSARY. OBVIOUSLY, THOSE CAN'T BE PREDICTED IN
ADVANCE. AS FOR YOU, YOU WILL SIT TO MY RIGHT."

 

  MORRISON ROSE AND MANAGED TO SHIFT HIS POSITION ALONG THE NARROW AISLE
ON THE DOOR SIDE OF THE SEATS AND MOVE ONE SEAT BACK. HE HAD BEEN IN
KONEV'S SEAT AND NOW HE WAS IN WHAT WOULD BE HIS OWN. HE COULD FEEL HIS
HEART POUNDING AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF IN THAT SAME SEAT ON THE FOLLOWING
DAY, WITH THE MINIATURIZATION PROCESS IN PROGRESS.

 

  HE SAID IN A MUFFLED VOICE, "THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN, THEN -- YURI KONEV
-- WHO WAS MINIATURIZED AND DEMINIATURIZED AND WAS UNHARMED BY THE
PROCESS."

 

  "YES."

 

  "AND HE MENTIONED NO DISCOMFORT IN THE PROCESS, NO SICKNESS, NO MENTAL
DISTURBANCE?"

 

  "NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS REPORTED."

 

  "WOULD THAT BE BECAUSE HE IS A STOIC? WOULD HE FEEL IT WOULD BE
BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF A HERO OF SOVIET SCIENCE TO COMPLAIN?"

 

  "DON'T BE FOOLISH. WE ARE NOT HEROES OF SOVIET SCIENCE AND THE ONE YOU
SPEAK OF CERTAINLY ISN'T. WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND SCIENTISTS AND, IN
FACT, IF THERE WERE ANY DISCOMFORT THAT WE FELT, WE WOULD BE COMPELLED
TO DESCRIBE IT IN FULL DETAIL, SINCE IT MIGHT BE THAT WITH MODIFICATIONS
OF THE PROCESS WE COULD REMOVE THAT DISCOMFORT AND MAKE FUTURE
MINIATURIZATIONS LESS DIFFICULT. HIDING ANY PART OF THE TRUTH WOULD BE
UNSCIENTIFIC, UNETHICAL, AND DANGEROUS. DON'T YOU SEE THAT -- SINCE YOU
ARE A SCIENTIST YOURSELF?"

 

  "YET THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. YURI KONEV SURVIVED
UNTOUCHED. PYOTR SHAPIROV DID NOT -- QUITE."

 

  "THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES," SAID KALIININ
IMPATIENTLY.

 

  "WE CAN'T REALLY TELL, CAN WE?"

 

  "THEN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, ALBERT. DO YOU THINK WE WOULD TAKE THE SHIP
INTO MINIATURIZATION WITHOUT A FINAL TESTING -- WITH AND WITHOUT HUMAN
BEINGS ABOARD? THIS SHIP WAS MINIATURIZED, EMPTY, DURING THE COURSE OF
THIS PAST NIGHT -- NOT TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT, BUT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT
ALL IS WELL."

 

  AT ONCE MORRISON STRUGGLED UPWARD TO GET OUT OF HIS SEAT. "IN THAT
CASE, IF YOU DON'T MIND, SOPHIA, I WANT TO GET OUT BEFORE IT IS TESTED
WITH HUMAN BEINGS ABOARD."

 

  "BUT, ALBERT, IT'S TOO LATE."

 

  "WHAT!"

 

  "LOOK OUT THE SHIP AT THE ROOM. YOU HAVEN'T ONCE LOOKED OUTSIDE SINCE
YOU GOT IN, WHICH, I SUPPOSE, WAS A GOOD THING. BUT LOOK OUT NOW. GO
AHEAD. THE WALLS ARE TRANSPARENT AND THE PROCESS IS COMPLETE FOR NOW.
PLEASE! LOOK!"

 

  MORRISON, STARTLED, DID SO AND THEN, VERY SLOWLY, HIS KNEES BENT AND
HE SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN. HE ASKED (AND EVEN AS HE DID SO, HE KNEW HOW
FOOLISH HE MUST SOUND), "DO THE SHIP'S WALLS HAVE A MAGNIFYING EFFECT?"

 

  "NO, OF COURSE NOT. EVERYTHING OUTSIDE IS AS IT ALWAYS IS. THE SHIP
AND I AND YOU HAVE BEEN MINIATURIZED TO ABOUT HALF OUR LINEAR
DIMENSIONS."

 

  29.

 

  MORRISON FELT DIZZINESS OVERCOME HIM AND HE BENT HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS
KNEES AND BREATHED SLOWLY AND DEEPLY. WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AGAIN, HE
SAW KALIININ WATCHING HIM THOUGHTFULLY. SHE WAS STANDING IN THE NARROW
AISLE, LEANING SLIGHTLY AGAINST A SEAT'S ARMREST TO ALLOW THE CEILING TO
CLEAR HER HEAD.

 

  "YOU MIGHT HAVE FAINTED THIS TIME," SHE SAID. "IT WOULD NOT HAVE
DISTURBED ME. WE ARE BEING DEMINIATURIZED NOW AND THAT WILL BE MORE
TIME-CONSUMING THAN THE MINIATURIZATION, WHICH TOOK NO MORE THAN THREE
OR FOUR MINUTES. IT WILL TAKE AN HOUR OR SO FOR US TO GET BACK, SO YOU
WILL HAVE AMPLE TIME TO RECOVER."

 

  "IT WAS NOT A DECENT ACT TO DO THIS WITHOUT TELLING ME, SOPHIA."

 

  "ON THE CONTRARY," SAID KALIININ. "IT WAS AN ACT OF KINDNESS. WOULD
YOU HAVE ENTERED THE SHIP AS FREELY AND AS EASILY AS YOU DID IF YOU HAD
SUSPECTED THAT WE WOULD BE MINIATURIZED? WOULD YOU HAVE INSPECTED THE
SHIP AS COOLLY IF YOU HAD KNOWN? AND IF YOU HAD BEEN ANTICIPATING
MINIATURIZATION, WOULD YOU NOT HAVE DEVELOPED PSYCHOGENIC SYMPTOMS OF
ALL SORTS?"

 

  MORRISON WAS SILENT.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "DID YOU FEEL ANYTHING? WERE YOU EVEN AWARE THAT YOU
WERE BEING MINIATURIZED?"

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO."

 

  THEN, DRIVEN BY A CERTAIN SHAME, HE SAID, "YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
MINIATURIZED BEFORE ANY MORE THAN I HAVE, HAVE YOU?"

 

  "NO. BEFORE THIS DAY, KONEV AND SHAPIROV HAVE BEEN THE ONLY HUMAN
BEINGS TO HAVE UNDERGONE MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "AND YOU WEREN'T AT ALL APPREHENSIVE?"

 

  SHE SAID, "I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. I WAS UNEASY. WE KNOW FROM OUR
EXPERIENCE WITH SPACE TRAVEL THAT, AS YOU SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN REACTION TO UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS. SOME
ASTRONAUTS SUFFER EPISODES OF NAUSEA UNDER ZERO GRAVITY AND SOME DO NOT,
FOR INSTANCE. I COULDN'T BE SURE HOW I WOULD REACT. -- DID YOU FEEL
NAUSEA?"

 

  "I DIDN'T UNTIL I FOUND OUT WE HAD BEEN MINIATURIZED, BUT I SUPPOSE
FEELING QUEASY NOW DOESN'T COUNT. -- WHO PLANNED THIS?"

 

  "NATALYA."

 

  "OF COURSE. I NEEDN'T HAVE ASKED," HE SAID DRILY.

 

  "THERE WERE REASONS. SHE FELT WE COULDN'T HAVE YOU BREAK DOWN ONCE THE
VOYAGE BEGAN. WE COULDN'T BE EXPECTED TO DEAL WITH HYSTERIA ON YOUR PART
ONCE WE BEGAN MINIATURIZING."

 

  "I SUPPOSE I DESERVE THAT LACK OF CONFIDENCE," SAID MORRISON, HIS EYES
LOOKING AWAY IN EMBARRASSMENT FROM THOSE OF KALIININ. "AND I IMAGINE SHE
ASSIGNED YOU TO COME WITH ME FOR THE PRECISE PURPOSE OF DISTRACTING MY
ATTENTION WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON."

 

  "NO. THAT WAS MY IDEA. SHE WANTED TO COME WITH YOU HERSELF, BUT WITH
HER, BY NOW, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ANTICIPATING TRICKERY."

 

  "WHEREAS WITH YOU, I MIGHT BE AT MY EASE."

 

  "AT LEAST, AS YOU SAY, DISTRACTED. I AM STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO DISTRACT
MEN." THEN, WITH A TOUCH OF BITTERNESS, "MOST MEN."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP, EYES NARROWING. "YOU SAID I MIGHT BE ANTICIPATING
TRICKERY."

 

  "I MEAN, WITH NATALYA."

 

  "WHY NOT WITH YOU? ALL I SEE NOW IS THAT EVERYTHING OUTSIDE SEEMS
ENLARGED. HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT THAT IS NOT AN ILLUSION, SOMETHING
DESIGNED TO MAKE ME THINK I HAVE BEEN MINIATURIZED AND THAT IT IS
HARMLESS -- MERELY SO THAT I STEP QUIETLY INTO THE SHIP TOMORROW?"

 

  "THAT'S RIDICULOUS, ALBERT, BUT LET'S CONSIDER SOMETHING. YOU AND I
HAVE LOST HALF OUR LINEAR DIMENSION IN EVERY DIRECTION. THE STRENGTH OF
OUR MUSCLES VARIES INVERSELY WITH THEIR CROSS-SECTIONS. THEY ARE NOW
HALF THEIR NORMAL WIDTH AND HALF THEIR NORMAL THICKNESS, SO THAT THEY
HAVE HALF TIMES HALF OR ONE FOURTH THE CROSS-SECTION AND, THEREFORE, THE
STRENGTH THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE. DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? DO YOU
UNDERSTAND?"

 

  "YES, OF COURSE," SAID MORRISON, ANNOYED. "THAT IS ELEMENTARY."

 

  "BUT OUR BODIES AS A WHOLE ARE HALF AS TALL, HALF AS WIDE, AND HALF AS
THICK, SO THAT THE TOTAL VOLUME -- AND MASS AND WEIGHT AS WELL -- IS
HALF TIMES HALF TIMES HALF OR ONE EIGHTH WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY. -- IF
WE ARE MINIATURIZED, THAT IS."

 

  "YES. THIS IS THE SQUARE-CUBE LAW. IT'S BEEN UNDERSTOOD SINCE
GALILEO'S TIME."

 

  "I KNOW, BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT. IF I WERE TO TRY TO
LIFT YOU NOW, I WOULD BE LIFTING ONE EIGHTH YOUR NORMAL WEIGHT AND I
WOULD BE DOING SO WITH MY MUSCLES AT ONE QUARTER THEIR NORMAL STRENGTH.
MY MUSCLES COMPARED TO YOUR WEIGHT WOULD BE TWICE AS STRONG AS THEY
WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE WERE NOT MINIATURIZED."

 

  AND WITH THAT, KALIININ THRUST HER HANDS UNDER HIS ARMPITS AND, WITH A
GRUNT, LIFTED. UP HE MOVED FROM HIS SEAT.

 

  SHE HELD HIM SO WHILE SHE GASPED TWICE AND THEN SHE LOWERED HIM. "IT'S
NOT EASY," SHE SAID, PANTING A BIT, "BUT I COULD DO IT. AND SINCE YOU
MAY BE TELLING YOURSELF, 'AH YES, BUT THIS IS SOPHIA, PROBABLY A SOVIET
WEIGHT LIFTER,' THEN DO IT TO ME."

 

  KALIININ SEATED HERSELF IN THE SEAT BEFORE HIM AND HELD OUT HER ARMS
TO EITHER SIDE AND SAID, "COME, STAND UP AND LIFT ME."

 

  MORRISON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND INTO THE AISLE. HE MOVED FORWARD,
TURNED, AND FACED HER. THE SLIGHT BENDING ENFORCED ON HIM BY THE LOW
CEILING MADE IT AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION. FOR A MOMENT, HE HESITATED.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "COME, SEIZE ME UNDER THE ARMS. I USE DEODORANT. AND
YOU NEEDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLY TOUCHING MY BREASTS. THEY HAVE
BEEN TOUCHED BEFORE THIS. COME -- I'M LIGHTER THAN YOU ARE AND YOU'RE
STRONGER THAN I AM. SINCE I HAVE LIFTED YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE
AT ALL LIFTING ME."

 

  NOR DID HE. HE COULDN'T LIFT WITH HIS FULL STRENGTH BECAUSE OF HIS
SLIGHT, UNCOMFORTABLE STOOP, BUT HE AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED THE FORCE HE
JUDGED, THROUGH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR AN OBJECT HER
SIZE. SHE FLOATED UPWARD, HOWEVER, ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE WERE WEIGHTLESS.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT PREPARED FOR THE POSSIBILITY,
HE ALMOST DROPPED HER.

 

  "DO YOU CONSIDER THAT AN ILLUSION?" KALIININ ASKED. "OR ARE WE
MINIATURIZED?"

 

  "WE ARE MINIATURIZED," SAID MORRISON. "BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT? I NEVER
SAW YOU MAKE A MOVE THAT LOOKED AS THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE USING
MINIATURIZATION CONTROLS."

 

  "I DIDN'T. IT'S ALL DONE FROM OUTSIDE. THE SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH
MINIATURIZATION DEVICES OF ITS OWN, BUT I WOULDN'T DARE USE THEM. THAT
WOULD BE PART OF NATALYA'S JOB."

 

  "AND NOW THE DEMINIATURIZATION IS BEING CONTROLLED FROM OUTSIDE, TOO,
ISN'T IT?"

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT."

 

  "AND IF THE DEMINIATURIZATION GETS SLIGHTLY OUT OF HAND, OUR BRAINS
WILL BE DAMANGED AS SHAPIROV'S WAS -- OR WORSE."

 

  "THAT'S NOT REALLY LIKELY," SAID KALIININ, STRETCHING HER LEGS OUT
INTO THE AISLE, "AND IT DOESN'T HELP TO THINK ABOUT IT. WHY NOT JUST
RELAX AND CLOSE YOUR EYES?"

 

  MORRISON PERSISTED. "BUT DAMAGE IS POSSIBLE."

 

  "OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE. ALMOST ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. A
THREE-METER-WIDE METEROITE MAY STRIKE TWO MINUTES FROM NOW, PENETRATE
THE MOUNTAIN SHELL ABOVE US, FLASH INTO THIS ROOM, AND DESTROY THE SHIP
AND US AND PERHAPS THE ENTIRE PROJECT IN A FEW FLAMING SECONDS. -- BUT
IT'S NOT LIKELY."

 

  MORRISON CRADLED HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS AND WONDERED WHETHER -- IF THE
SHIP STARTED WARMING -- HE COULD FEEL THE HEAT BEFORE HIS BRAIN PROTEINS
DENATURED.

 

  30.

 

  WELL OVER HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED BEFORE MORRISON FELT CONVINCED THAT
THE OBJECTS HE COULD SEE OUTSIDE THE SHIP WERE SHRINKING AND WERE
RECEDING PERCEPTIBLY TOWARD THEIR NORMAL SIZE.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I AM THINKING OF A PARADOX."

 

  "WHAT'S THAT?" SAID KALIININ, YAWNING. SHE HAD OBVIOUSLY TAKEN HER OWN
ADVICE ABOUT THE ADVISABILITY OF RELAXING.

 

  "THE OBJECTS OUTSIDE THE SHIP SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AS WE SHRINK.
OUGHT NOT THE WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT OUTSIDE THE SHIP ALSO GROW LARGER,
BECOMING LONGER IN WAVELENGTH, AS WE SHRINK? SHOULD WE NOT SEE
EVERYTHING OUTSIDE TURN REDDISH, SINCE THERE CAN SCARCELY BE ENOUGH
ULTRAVIOLET OUTSIDE TO EXPAND AND REPLACE THE SHORTER-WAVE VISIBLE
LIGHT?"

 

  KALIININ SAID, "IF YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT WAVES OUTSIDE, THAT WOULD
INDEED BE HOW THEY WOULD APPEAR TO YOU. BUT YOU DON'T. YOU SEE THE LIGHT
WAVES ONLY AFTER THEY'VE ENTERED THE SHIP AND IMPINGED UPON YOUR RETINA.
AND AS THEY ENTER THE SHIP, THEY COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE
MINIATURIZATION FIELD AND AUTOMATICALLY SHRINK IN WAVELENGTH, SO THAT
YOU SEE THOSE WAVELENGTHS INSIDE THE SHIP EXACTLY AS YOU WOULD SEE THEM
OUTSIDE."

 

  "IF THEY SHRINK IN WAVELENGTH, THEY MUST GAIN ENERGY."

 

  "YES, IF PLANCK'S CONSTANT WERE THE SAME SIZE INSIDE THE
MINIATURIZATION FIELD AS IT IS OUTSIDE. BUT PLANCK'S CONSTANT DECREASES
INSIDE THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD -- THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF
MINIATURIZATION. THE WAVELENGTHS, IN SHRINKING, MAINTAIN THEIR
RELATIONSHIP TO THE SHRUNKEN PLANCK'S CONSTANT AND DO NOT GAIN ENERGY.
AN ANALOGOUS CASE IS THAT OF THE ATOMS. THEY ALSO SHRINK AND YET THE
INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG ATOMS AND AMONG THE SUBATOMIC PARTICLES THAT
MAKE THEM UP REMAIN THE SAME TO US INSIDE THE SHIP AS THEY WOULD SEEM TO
US OUTSIDE THE SHIP."

 

  "BUT GRAVITY CHANGES. IT BECOMES WEAKER IN HERE."

 

  "THE STRONG INTERACTION AND THE ELECTROWEAK INTERACTION COME UNDER THE
UMBRELLA OF THE QUANTUM THEORY. THEY DEPEND ON PLANCK'S CONSTANT. AS FOR
GRAVITATION?" KALIININ SHRUGGED. "DESPITE TWO CENTURIES OF EFFORT,
GRAVITATION HAS NEVER BEEN QUANTIZED. FRANKLY, I THINK THE GRAVITATIONAL
CHANGE WITH MINIATURIZATION IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH THAT GRAVITATION CANNOT
BE QUANTIZED, THAT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY NONQUANTUM IN NATURE."

 

  "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT," SAID MORRISON. "TWO CENTURIES OF FAILURE CAN
MERELY MEAN WE HAVEN'T MANAGED TO GET DEEP ENOUGH INTO THE PROBLEM YET.
SUPERSTRING THEORY NEARLY GAVE US OUR UNIFIED FIELD AT LAST." (IT
RELIEVED HIM TO DISCUSS THE MATTER. SURELY HE COULDN'T DO SO IF HIS
BRAIN WERE HEATING IN THE LEAST.)

 

  "NEARLY DOESN'T COUNT," SAID KALIININ. "STILL, SHAPIROV AGREED WITH
YOU, I THINK. IT WAS HIS NOTION THAT ONCE WE TIED PLANCK'S CONSTANT TO
THE SPEED OF LIGHT, WE WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF
MINIATURIZING AND DEMINIATURIZING IN AN ESSENTIALLY ENERGY-FREE MANNER,
BUT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE THEORETICAL EFFECT OF BEING ABLE TO WORK OUT
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN QUANTUM THEORY AND RELATIVITY AND FINALLY HAVE A
GOOD UNIFIED FIELD THEORY. AND PROBABLY A SIMPLER ONE THAN WE COULD HAVE
IMAGINED POSSIBLE, HE WOULD SAY."

 

  "MAYBE," SAID MORRISON. HE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO COMMENT BEYOND THAT.

 

  "SHAPIROV WOULD SAY," SAID KALIININ, WARMING TO THE TASK, "THAT AT
ULTRAMINIATURIZATION, THE GRAVITATIONAL EFFECT WOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO
ZERO TO BE UTTERLY IGNORED AND THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WOULD BE SO GREAT
THAT IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED INFINITE. WITH MASS VIRTUALLY ZERO, INERTIA
WOULD BE VIRTUALLY ZERO AND ANY OBJECT, LIKE THIS SHIP, FOR INSTANCE,
COULD BE ACCELERATED WITH VIRTUALLY ZERO ENERGY INPUT TO ANY SPEED. WE
WOULD HAVE, PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, ANTIGRAVITY AND FASTER-THAN-LIGHT
TRAVEL. CHEMICAL DRIVE, HE SAID, GAVE US THE SOLAR SYSTEM, ION DRIVE
WOULD GIVE US THE NEARER STARS, BUT RELATIVISTIC MINIATURIZATION WOULD
GIVE US THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AT A BOUND."

 

  "IT'S A BEAUTIFUL VISION," SAID MORRISON, RAVISHED.

 

  "THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR NOW, DON'T YOU?"

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "ALL THAT -- IF WE CAN READ SHAPIROV'S MIND. AND IF
HE REALLY HAD SOMETHING THERE AND WASN'T MERELY DREAMING."

 

  "ISN'T THE CHANCE WORTH THE RISK?"

 

  "I AM ON THE POINT OF BELIEVING SO," SAID MORRISON IN A LOW VOICE.
"YOU ARE TERRIBLY CONVINCING. WHY COULDN'T NATALYA HAVE USED ARGUMENTS
OF THAT SORT, RATHER THAN THOSE SHE DID USE?"

 

  "NATALYA IS -- NATALYA. SHE IS A HIGHLY PRACTICAL PERSON, NOT A
DREAMER. SHE GETS THINGS DONE."

 

  MORRISON STUDIED KALIININ AS SHE SAT, NOW IN THE SEAT TO HIS LEFT,
LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH AN ABSTRACTED LOOK THAT GAVE HER PROFILE THE
APPEARANCE OF AN IMPRACTICAL DREAMER, AT THAT -- BUT PERHAPS NOT ONE
WHO, LIKE SHAPIROV, DREAMED OF CONQUERING THE UNIVERSE. WITH HER, IT WAS
SOMETHING CLOSER TO HOME PERHAPS.

 

  HE SAID, "YOUR UNHAPPINESS IS NOT MY BUSINESS, SOPHIA, AS YOU'VE SAID
-- BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT YURI."

 

  HER EYES FLASHED. "ARKADY! I KNOW IT WAS HE. HE IS A -- A --" SHE
SHOOK HER HEAD. "WITH ALL HIS EDUCATION AND ALL HIS GENIUS, HE REMAINS A
PEASANT. I ALWAYS THINK OF HIM AS A BEARDED SERF WITH A VODKA BOTTLE."

 

  "I THINK HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT YOU IN HIS OWN WAY, EVEN IF HE DOESN'T
EXPRESS HIMSELF POETICALLY. EVERYONE MUST BE CONCERNED."

 

  KALIININ STARED AT MORRISON FIERCELY, AS IF HOLDING HER WORDS BACK.

 

  HE PRODDED HER GENTLY, SAYING, "WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT? I
THINK IT WILL HELP AND I AM A LOGICAL CHOICE, BEING THE OUTSIDER OF THE
PARTY -- I ASSURE YOU I AM TRUSTWORTHY."

 

  KALIININ LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN, THIS TIME ALMOST GRATEFULLY.

 

  "YURI!" SHE SPAT. "EVERYONE MAY BE CONCERNED, EXCEPT YURI. HE HAS NO
FEELINGS."

 

  "HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU AT ONE TIME."

 

  "MUST HE? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HE HAS A -- A --" -- SHE LOOKED UP AND
SPREAD HER HANDS, WHICH WERE SHAKING, AS THOUGH GROPING FOR A WORD AND
HAVING TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING INFERIOR -- "VISION."

 

  "WE'RE NOT ALWAYS MASTERS OF OUR OWN EMOTIONS AND AFFECTIONS, SOPHIA.
IF HE HAS FOUND ANOTHER WOMAN AND DREAMS OF HER --"

 

  "THERE'S NO OTHER WOMAN," SAID KALIININ, FROWNING. "NONE! HE USES THAT
AS AN EXCUSE TO HIDE BEHIND! HE LOVED ME, IF AT ALL, ONLY ABSENTLY,
BECAUSE I WAS CONVENIENT AT HAND, BECAUSE I SATISFIED A VAGUE PHYSICAL
NEED, AND BECAUSE I WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT, SO THAT HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO LOSE MUCH TIME DALLYING WITH ME. AS LONG AS HE HAD THIS PROJECT
FIRMLY IN HAND, HE DIDN'T MIND HAVING ME -- QUIETLY, UNOBTRUSIVELY -- AT
ODD MOMENTS."

 

  "A MAN'S WORK --"

 

  "NEED NOT FILL EVERY MOMENT OF TIME. I TOLD YOU HE HAS A VISION. HE
PLANS TO BE THE NEW NEWTON, THE NEW EINSTEIN. HE WANTS TO MAKE
DISCOVERIES SO FUNDAMENTAL, SO GREAT, THAT HE WILL LEAVE NOTHING FOR THE
FUTURE. HE WILL TAKE SHAPIROV'S SPECULATIONS AND TURN THEM INTO HARD
SCIENCE. YURI KONEV WILL BECOME THE WHOLE OF THE NATURAL LAW AND
EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE COMMENTARY!"

 

  "MIGHT THAT NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ADMIRABLE AMBITION?"

 

  "NOT WHEN IT MAKES HIM SACRIFICE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ELSE, WHEN IT
MAKES HIM DENY HIS OWN CHILD. I? WHAT DO I MATTER? I CAN BE NEGLECTED,
DENIED. I AM AN ADULT. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. BUT A BABY? A CHILD?
TO DENY HER A FATHER? TO REFUSE HER? TO REJECT HER? SHE WOULD DISTRACT
HIM FROM HIS WORK, SHE WOULD MAKE DEMANDS ON HIM, SHE WOULD CONSUME A
FEW MOMENTS OF TIME HERE AND THERE -- SO HE INSISTS HE IS NOT THE
FATHER."

 

  "A GENETIC ANALYSIS --"

 

  "NO. WOULD I DRAG HIM TO COURT AND FORCE A LEGAL DECISION UPON HIM?
CONSIDER WHAT HIS DENIAL IMPLIES? THE CHILD IS NOT A VIRGIN BIRTH.
SOMEONE MUST BE THE FATHER. HE IMPLIES -- NO, HE STATES -- THAT I AM
PROMISCUOUS. HE HAS NOT HESITATED TO GIVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT I DO
NOT KNOW THE FATHER OF MY CHILD SINCE I AM LOST AMONG THE NUMEROUS
POSSIBILITIES. SHALL I LABOR TO MAKE A MAN AS LOW AS HE IS THE LEGALLY
PROVED FATHER OF MY CHILD AGAINST HIS WILL? NO, LET HIM COME TO ME AND
ADMIT HE IS THE FATHER AND APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE -- AND I MAY
ALLOW HIM A GLANCE, NOW AND THEN, AT THE CHILD."

 

  "YET I HAVE A FEELING YOU STILL LOVE HIM."

 

  "IF I DO, THAT IS MY CURSE," SAID KALIININ BITTERLY. "IT SHALL NOT BE
MY CHILD'S."

 

  "IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE HAD TO BE PERSUADED TO UNDERTAKE THIS
MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "AND WORK WITH HIM? YES, THAT IS WHY. BUT THEY TELL ME I CANNOT BE
REPLACED, THAT WHAT WE MAY DO FOR SCIENCE LIES FAR ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY
CONCEIVABLE PERSONAL FEELING -- ANY ANGER, ANY HATE. BESIDES --"

 

  "BESIDES?"

 

  "BESIDES, IF I ABANDON THE PROJECT, I LOSE MY STATUS AS A SOVIET
SCIENTIST. I LOSE MANY PRIVILEGES AND PERQUISITES, WHICH DO NOT MATTER,
AND SO DOES MY DAUGHTER -- WHICH MATTERS A GREAT DEAL."

 

  "DID YURI HAVE TO BE PERSUADED, TOO, TO WORK WITH YOU?"

 

  "HE? OF COURSE NOT. THE PROJECT IS ALL HE KNOWS AND SEES. HE DOES NOT
LOOK AT ME. HE DOES NOT SEE ME. AND IF HE DIES IN THE COURSE OF THIS
ATTEMPT --" SHE HELD OUT HER HAND IN APPEAL TO HIM. "PLEASE UNDERSTAND
THAT I DO NOT FOR A MOMENT BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN. IT IS JUST A
STUPIDLY ROMANTIC NOTION THAT I TORTURE MYSELF WITH FOR THE LOVE OF
PAIN, I SUPPOSE. IF HE SHOULD DIE, HE WOULD NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT I
WOULD DIE WITH HIM."

 

  MORRISON FELT HIMSELF TREMBLE. "DON'T TALK LIKE THAT," HE SAID. "AND
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR DAUGHTER IN THAT CASE? DID NATALYA TELL YOU
THAT?"

 

  "SHE DID NOT HAVE TO. I KNOW THAT WITHOUT HER. MY DAUGHTER WOULD BE
REARED BY THE STATE, AS THE CHILD OF A SOVIET MARTYR TO SCIENCE. SHE
MIGHT BE BETTER OFF SO." SOPHIA PAUSED AND LOOKED AROUND. "BUT IT'S
BEGINNING TO LOOK QUITE NORMAL OUT THERE. WE SHOULD BE OUT OF THE SHIP
SOON."

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED.

 

  "YOU WILL HAVE TO SPEND MUCH OF THE REST OF THE DAY BEING MEDICALLY
AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY EXAMINED, ALBERT. SO WILL I. IT WILL BE VERY BORING,
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE. HOW DO YOU FEEL?"

 

  "I'D FEEL BETTER," SAID MORRISON IN A BURST OF HONESTY, "IF YOU HADN'T
TALKED ABOUT DYING. -- LISTEN! TOMORROW, WHEN WE MAKE THE TRIP INTO
SHAPIROV'S BODY, HOW FAR WILL WE BE MINIATURIZED?"

 

  "THAT WILL BE NATALYA'S DECISION. TO CELLULAR DIMENSIONS AT THE VERY
LEAST, OBVIOUSLY. PERHAPS TO MOLECULAR DIMENSIONS."

 

  "HAS ANYONE EVER DONE THAT?"

 

  "NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE."

 

  "RABBITS? INANIMATE OBJECTS?"

 

  KALIININ SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID AGAIN, "NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE."

 

  "HOW, THEN, DOES ANYONE KNOW THAT MINIATURIZATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT IS
POSSIBLE? OR THAT, IF IT IS, ANY OF US CAN SURIVIVE?"

 

  "THE THEORY SAYS IT IS AND THAT WE CAN. SO FAR, EVERY BIT OF
EXPERIMENTATION HAS FIT IN WITH THE THEORY."

 

  "YES, BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS BOUNDARIES. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF
ULTRAMINIATURIZATION WERE TESTED ON A SIMPLE BAR OF PLASTIC, THEN ON A
RABBIT, THEN ON A --"

 

  "YES, OF COURSE. BUT PERSUADING THE CENTRAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE TO
ALLOW THE ENERGY EXPENDITURE WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS TASK AND SUCH
EXPERIMENTS WOULD HAVE TO BE DRIBBLED OUT OVER MONTHS AND YEARS. WE HAVE
NO TIME! WE MUST GET INTO SHAPIROV IMMEDIATELY."

 

  "BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED, CROSSING INTO AN
UNTESTED REGION, WITH ONLY THE MAYBES OF THEORY TO --"

 

  "EXACTLY, EXACTLY. COME, THE LIGHT IS FLASHING AND WE MUST EMERGE AND
ACCOMPANY THE WAITING PHYSICIANS."

 

  BUT FOR MORRISON THE MARGINAL EUPHORIA OF A SAFE DEMINIATURIZATION WAS
SEEPING AWAY. WHAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED TODAY WAS IN NO WAY INDICATIVE OF
WHAT HE MUST FACE THE NEXT DAY.

 

  THE TERROR WAS RETURNING.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 8 -- PRELIMINAIRIES

 

  THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY COMES AT THE START. IT'S CALLED "GETTING
READY."

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  31.

 

  LATER THAT EVENING, AFTER A LONG -- AND TEDIOUS -- MEDICAL EXAM, HE
JOINED THE FOUR SOVIET RESEARCHERS FOR DINNER. THE LAST SUPPER, MORRISON
THOUGHT GRIMLY.

 

  SITTING DOWN, HE BURST OUT, "NO ONE TOLD ME THE RESULTS OF MY
EXAMINATION!" HE TURNED TO KALIININ. "DID THEY EXAMINE YOU, SOPHIA?"

 

  "YES, INDEED, ALBERT."

 

  "DID THEY TELL YOU THE RESULTS?"

 

  "I'M AFRAID NOT. SINCE IT IS NOT WE WHO PAY THEM, I SUPPOSE THEY DON'T
FEEL THEY OWE US ANYTHING."

 

  "IT DOESN'T MATTER," SAID DEZHNEV JOVIALLY. "MY OLD FATHER USED TO
SAY, 'BAD NEWS HAS THE WINGS OF AN EAGLE, GOOD NEWS THE LEGS OF A
SLOTH.' IF THEY SAID NOTHING, IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING BAD TO
REPORT."

 

  "EVEN THE BAD NEWS," SAID BORANOVA, "WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO ME --
AND ONLY TO ME. I AM THE ONE WHO MUST DECIDE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY US."

 

  "WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU ABOUT ME?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  "THAT THERE IS NOTHING IMPORTANT WRONG WITH YOU. YOU WILL BE COMING
WITH US AND IN TWELVE HOURS THE ADVENTURE WILL BEGIN."

 

  "IS THERE ANYTHING UNIMPORTANT WRONG WITH ME, THEN, NATALYA?"

 

  "NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING, EXCEPT THAT YOU DISPLAY, ACCORDING TO ONE
DOCTOR, A 'TYPICAL AMERICAN BAD TEMPER.'"

 

  "HUH!" SAID MORRISON. "ONE OF OUR AMERICAN FREEDOMS IS THAT OF BEING
BAD-TEMPERED WHEN DOCTORS SHOW A TYPICAL SOVIET LACK OF CONCERN FOR
THEIR PATIENTS."

 

  NEVERTHELESS, HIS APPREHENSION OVER THE STATE OF HIS MIND EBBED AND,
AS IT DID SO, INEVITABLY THE APPREHENSION OVER HIS IMPENDING
MINIATURIZATION ROSE HIGHER.

 

  HE LAPSED INTO SILENCE, EATING SLOWLY AND WITHOUT MUCH OF AN APPETITE.

 

  32.

 

  YURI KONEV WAS THE FIRST TO RISE FROM THE DINNER TABLE. FOR A MOMENT
HE REMAINED STANDING, LEANING FORWARD OVER THE TABLE, A SLIGHT FROWN ON
HIS INTENSE, YOUTHFUL FACE.

 

  "NATALYA," HE SAID, "I MUST TAKE ALBERT TO MY OFFICE. IT IS NECESSARY
THAT WE DISCUSS TOMORROW'S TASK AND PREPARE FOR IT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU WILL REMEMBER, PLEASE, THAT WE MUST ALL HAVE A
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. I DON'T WISH YOU TO FORGET THE PASSAGE OF TIME. DO
YOU WANT ARKADY TO GO WITH YOU?"

 

  "I DON'T NEED HIM," SAID KONEV HAUGHTILY.

 

  "NEVERTHELESS," SAID BORANOVA, "THERE WILL BE TWO GUARDS AT YOUR
OFFICE DOOR AND YOU WILL CALL OUT IF YOU NEED THEM."

 

  KONEV TURNED FROM HER IMPATIENTLY AND SAID, "I WON'T NEED THEM,
NATALYA, I'M SURE. COME WITH ME, ALBERT."

 

  MORRISON, WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THEM BOTH FROM UNDER LOWERED EYEBROWS,
ROSE AND SAID, "IS THIS GOING TO BE A LONG TRIP? I'M TIRED OF BEING
SHUTTLED FROM POINT TO POINT IN THE GROTTO."

 

  MORRISON KNEW WELL HE WAS BEING UNGRACIOUS, BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO
BOTHER KONEV, WHO RESPONDED JUST AS UNGRACIOUSLY, "I SHOULD THINK A
PROFESSOR WOULD BE USED TO PLUNGING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS A UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS."

 

  MORRISON FOLLOWED KONEV OUT THE DOOR AND TOGETHER THEY TRAMPED ALONG
THE CORRIDOR IN SILENCE. MORRISON WAS AWARE THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT TWO
GUARDS FELL IN BEHIND THEM. HE HEARD ADDITIONAL FOOTSTEPS KEEPING TIME
WITH HIS OWN. HE LOOKED BACK, BUT KONEV DID NOT.

 

  MORRISON SAID IMPATIENTLY, "MUCH LONGER, YURI?"

 

  "THAT IS A FOOLISH QUESTION, ALBERT. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF WALKING
YOU PAST OUR DESTINATION. WHEN WE GET THERE, WE WILL BE THERE. IF WE ARE
STILL WALKING, IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THERE YET."

 

  "I SHOULD THINK, WITH ALL THIS WALKING, YOU MIGHT ARRANGE GOLF CARTS
OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT FOR THE CORRIDORS."

 

  "ANYTHING TO ALLOW THE MUSCLES TO ATROPHY, ALBERT? COME, YOU ARE NOT
SO OLD THAT YOU CANNOT WALK OR SO YOUNG THAT YOU MUST BE CARRIED."

 

  MORRISON THOUGHT, IF I WERE THAT POOR WOMAN WITH HIS CHILD, I WOULD
SHOOT OFF FIREWORKS TO CELEBRATE HIS DENIAL OF FATHERHOOD.

 

  THEY REACHED KONEV'S OFFICE AT LAST. AT LEAST MORRISON ASSUMED IT WAS
HIS OFFICE WHEN KONEV BARKED THE WORD "OPEN" AND THE DOOR SLID SMOOTHLY
OPEN IN RESPONSE TO HIS VOICEPRINT. KONEV STRODE THROUGH FIRST.

 

  "WHAT IF SOMEONE IMITATES YOUR VOICE?" ASKED MORRISON CURIOUSLY. "YOU
DON'T HAVE A VERY DISTINCTIVE VOICE, YOU KNOW."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT ALSO SCANS MY FACE. IT WILL NOT RESPOND TO EITHER
SEPARATELY."

 

  "AND IF YOU HAVE A COLD?"

 

  "ONE TIME WHEN I HAD A BAD ONE, I COULD NOT GET INTO MY OFFICE FOR
THREE DAYS AND I FINALLY HAD TO HAVE THE DOOR OPENED MECHANICALLY. IF MY
FACE WERE BRUISED OR SCARRED BY ACCIDENT, I MIGHT ALSO HAVE TROUBLE.
STILL, THAT IS THE PRICE OF SECURITY."

 

  "BUT ARE THE PEOPLE HERE SO -- INQUISITIVE -- THAT THEY WOULD INVADE
YOUR PRIVACY?"

 

  "PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE AND IT IS NOT WISE TO OVERTEMPT EVEN THE BEST OF
THEM. I HAVE THINGS HERE UNIQUE TO MYSELF AND THEY MAY BE VIEWED ONLY
WHEN I DECIDE TO ALLOW IT. THIS, FOR INSTANCE." HIS SLIM HAND (VERY WELL
CARED-FOR AND MANICURED, MORRISON NOTICED -- HE MIGHT NEGLECT OTHER
THINGS FOR HIS WORK, BUT NOT HIMSELF) RESTED ON AN EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE
AND THICK VOLUME, WHICH, IN TURN, RESTED ON A STAND THAT HAD BEEN
CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR IT.

 

  "WHAT IS THAT?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  "THAT," SAID KONEV, "IS ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV -- OR AT LEAST THE
ESSENCE OF HIM." HE OPENED THE BOOK AND FLIPPED THE PAGES. PAGE AFTER
PAGE (ALL OF THEM, PERHAPS) WERE FILLED WITH SYMBOLS ARRANGED IN
DIAGRAMMATIC FASHION.

 

  KONEV SAID, "I HAVE IT ON MICROFILM, OF COURSE, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN
CONVENIENCES TO HAVING IT IN A PRINTED VOLUME." HE PATTED THE PAGES
ALMOST LOVINGLY.

 

  "I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "THIS IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN, TRANSLATED INTO A
SYMBOLISM OF MY OWN DEVISING. FED INTO THE APPROPRIATE SOFTWARE, IT CAN
RECONSTITUTE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAP OF THE BRAIN IN INTIMATE DETAIL ON
A COMPUTER SCREEN."

 

  "ASTONISHING," SAID MORRISON, "IF YOU ARE SERIOUS."

 

  "I AM SERIOUS," SAID KONEV. "I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER ON THIS
TASK: TRANSLATING BRAIN STRUCTURE INTO SYMBOLS AND SYMBOLS INTO BRAIN
STRUCTURE. I HAVE INVENTED AND ADVANCED THIS SCIENCE OF CEREBROGRAPHY."

 

  "AND YOU USED SHAPIROV AS YOUR SUBJECT."

 

  "BY INCREDIBLE GOOD FORTUNE, I DID. OR PERHAPS IT WAS NOT GOOD
FORTUNE, BUT MERELY INEVITABLE. WE ALL HAVE OUR SMALL VANITIES AND IT
SEEMED TO SHAPIROV THAT HIS BRAIN WAS WORTH PRESERVING IN DETAIL. ONCE I
BEGAN WORKING ON THIS FIELD UNDER HIS DIRECTION -- FOR THERE WAS THE
FEELING THAT WE MIGHT SOMEDAY WANT TO EXPLORE ANIMAL BRAINS AT LEAST --
HE INSISTED ON HAVING HIS OWN BRAIN ANALYZED CEREBROGRAPHICALLY."

 

  MORRISON SAID WITH A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT, "CAN YOU GET HIS THEORIES OUT
OF THE RECORDED CEREBRAL STRUCTURE OF HIS BRAIN?"

 

  "OF COURSE NOT. THESE SYMBOLS RECORD A CEREBRAL SCANNING THAT WAS
CARRIED THROUGH THREE YEARS AGO. THAT WAS BEFORE HE HAD EVOLVED HIS
RECENT NOTIONS AND, IN ANY CASE, WHAT I HAVE PRESERVED HERE IS,
UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE AND NOT THE THOUGHTS. STILL,
THE CEREBROGRAPH WILL BE INVALUABLE TO US IN TOMORROW'S VOYAGE."

 

  "I SHOULD THINK SO -- BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS."

 

  "I'M NOT SURPRISED. I HAVE PUBLISHED PAPERS ON THIS, BUT ONLY IN THE
GROTTO'S OWN PUBLICATION -- AND THESE REMAIN HIGHLY CLASSIFIED. NO ONE
OUTSIDE THE GROTTO, NOT EVEN HERE IN THE SOVIET UNION, KNOWS OF THEM."

 

  "THAT IS BAD POLICY. YOU WILL BE OVERTAKEN BY SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL
PUBLISH AND WHO WILL BE GRANTED PRIORITY."

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD. "AT THE FIRST SIGN THAT SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN
THIS DIRECTION ARE BEING MADE ELSEWHERE, ENOUGH OF MY EARLY WORK WILL BE
PUBLISHED TO ESTABLISH PRIORITY. I HAVE CEREBROGRAPHS OF CANINE BRAINS
THAT I CAN PUBLISH, FOR INSTANCE. BUT NEVER MIND THAT. THE POINT IS THAT
WE HAVE A MAP OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN TO GUIDE US, WHICH IS A MATTER OF
INCREDIBLE GOOD FORTUNE. IT WAS MADE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE MIGHT
NEED IT SOMEDAY TO GUIDE US THROUGH THAT VERY CEREBRAL JUNGLE."

 

  KONEV TURNED TO A COMPUTER AND, WITH PRACTICED FLIPS OF HIS WRIST,
INSERTED FIVE LARGE DISCS.

 

  "EACH ONE OF THESE," HE SAID, "CAN HOLD ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE
CENTRAL MOSCOW LIBRARY WITHOUT CROWDING. IT IS ALL DEVOTED TO SHAPIROV'S
BRAIN."

 

  "ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME," SAID MORRISON INDIGNANTLY, "THAT YOU
COULD TRANSFER ALL THAT INFORMATION, ALL OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN, INTO THAT
BOOK YOU HAVE HERE?"

 

  "WELL, NO," SAID KONEV, GLANCING AT THE BOOK. "IN COMPARISON WITH THE
TOTAL CODE, THAT BOOK IS ONLY A SMALL PAMPHLET. HOWEVER, IT DOES HOLD
THE BASIC SKELETON, SO TO SPEAK, OF SHAPIROV'S NEURONIC STRUCTURE AND I
WAS ABLE TO USE IT AS A GUIDE BY WHICH TO DIRECT A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT
MAPPED IT OUT IN GREATER DETAIL. IT TOOK MONTHS FOR THE BEST AND MOST
ADVANCED COMPUTER WE HAVE TO DO THE JOB.

 

  "AND EVEN SO, ALBERT, ALL WE HAVE REACHES MERELY TO THE CELLULAR
LEVEL. IF WE WERE TO MAP THE BRAIN DOWN TO THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AND TRY
TO RECORD ALL THE PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS -- ALL THE CONCEIVABLE
THOUGHTS THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM A PARTICULAR HUMAN BRAIN LIKE SHAPIROV'S;
ALL THE CREATIVITY, ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL -- I SUPPOSE IT WOULD TAKE A
COMPUTER THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE WORKING FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THAN
THE UNIVERSE HAS EXISTED. WHAT I HAVE, HOWEVER, MAY BE ENOUGH FOR OUR
TASK."

 

  MORRISON, ENTRANCED, ASKED, "CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS, YURI?"

 

  KONEV STUDIED THE COMPUTER -- WHICH WAS TURNED ON, AS ONE COULD TELL
BY THE SOFT WHISPER OF ITS COOLING MECHANISM -- THEN PUSHED THE
NECESSARY KEYS. ON THE SCREEN THERE APPEARED THE SIDE VIEW OF A HUMAN
BRAIN.

 

  KONEV SAID, "THIS CAN BE VIEWED AT ANY CROSS-SECTION." HE PRESSED A
KEY AND THE BRAIN BEGAN TO PEEL AS THOUGH IT WERE BEING CONTINUALLY
SLICED BY AN ULTRATHIN MICROTOME SOME THOUSANDS OF SLICES PER SECOND.
"AT THIS RATE," HE SAID, "IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO
COMPLETE THE TASK, BUT I COULD STOP IT AT ANY CHOSEN POINT. I COULD ALSO
CUT OFF THICKER SLICES OR CUT OFF ONE THICK CALCULATED SLICE TO BRING ME
AT ONCE TO ANY WANTED CROSS-SECTION."

 

  AS HE SPOKE, HE DEMONSTRATED. "OR I COULD ORIENT IT IN ANOTHER
DIRECTION OR ROTATE IT ALONG ANY AXIS. OR I CAN MAGNIFY IT TO ANY EXTENT
DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL, EITHER SLOWLY OR, AS YOU SEE, QUICKLY." AS
HE SAID THIS, THE MATERIAL OF THE BRAIN SPREAD OUTWARD IN ALL DIRECTIONS
FROM A CENTRAL POINT -- DIZZYINGLY -- SO THAT MORRISON WAS FORCED TO
BLINK HIS EYES AND THEN LOOK AWAY.

 

  KONEV SAID, "THIS IS NOW AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL. THOSE SMALL OBJECTS
ARE INDIVIDUAL NEURONS AND IF I EXPANDED THE IMAGE STILL FURTHER, YOU
WOULD SEE THE AXONS AND DENDRITES. IF ONE WISHES, WE COULD FOLLOW A
SINGLE AXON THROUGH THE CELL INTO A DENDRITE AND ACROSS A SYNAPSE TO
ANOTHER NEURON AND SO ON, TRAVELING, BY COMPUTER, THROUGH A BRAIN
THREE-DIMENSIONALLY. NOR IS THE MATTER OF THREE DEMENSIONS JUST A MANNER
OF SPEAKING. THE COMPUTER IS OUTFITTED FOR HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGING AND IT
CAN PRESENT A THREE-DIMENSIONAL APPEARANCE QUITE LITERALLY."

 

  MORRISON SAID CHALLENGINGLY, "THEN WHY DO YOU NEED MINIATURIZATION?
WHY DO YOU NEED TO SEND SHIPS INTO THE BRAIN?"

 

  KONEV BRIEFLY ALLOWED A LOOK OF CONTEMPT TO CROSS HIS FACE. "THAT IS A
FOOLISH QUESTION, ALBERT, AND I SUPPOSE IT IS INSPIRED ONLY BY YOUR FEAR
OF MINIATURIZATION. YOU ARE GROPING FOR ANY EXCUSE TO ELIMINATE IT. WHAT
YOU SEE HERE ON THE SCREEN IS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAPPING OF THE BRAIN,
BUT ONLY THREE-DIMENSIONAL. IT HAS CAUGHT IT AT WHAT IS, ESSENTIALLY, AN
INSTANT OF TIME. IN EFFECT, WE SEE UNCHANGING MATERIAL -- DEAD MATERIAL.
WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETECT IS THE LIVING ACTIVITY OF THE NEURONS,
THE CHANGING ACTIVITY WITH TIME. WE WANT A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL VIEW OF THE
ELECTRIC POTENTIALS THAT RISE AND FALL, THE MICROCURRENTS THAT TRAVEL
ALONG THE CELLS AND CELL FIBERS, AND WE WANT TO INTERPRET THEM INTO
THOUGHTS. THAT'S YOUR TASK, ALBERT. ARKADY DEZHNEV WILL MANIPULATE THE
SHIP ALONG THE ROUTES I HAVE CHOSEN AND YOU WILL GIVE US THE THOUGHTS."

 

  "ON WHAT BASIS HAVE YOU CHOSEN THE ROUTES?"

 

  "ON THE BASIS OF YOUR OWN PAPERS, ALBERT. I HAVE CHOSEN THE REGIONS
YOU HAD DECIDED MUST REPRESENT THE NEURONIC NETWORK FOR CREATIVE THOUGHT
AND, USING THIS BOOK, WITH ITS CODED REPRESENTATION OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN
AS MY INITIAL GUIDE, I CALCULATED CENTERS WHERE MORE OR LESS DIRECT
PATHWAYS COULD BE FOUND TO SEVERAL PORTIONS OF THE NETWORK. I THEN
LOCATED THEM MORE ACCURATELY ON THE COMPUTER AND IT IS TO ONE OR MORE OF
THOSE CENTERS THAT WE WILL PENETRATE TOMORROW."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO DETERMINE ACTUAL THOUGHTS, EVEN IF WE FIND THE CENTERS IN WHICH
THINKING TAKES PLACE. IT'S AS THOUGH WE MIGHT REACH A PLACE WHERE WE CAN
HEAR PEOPLE'S VOICES, BUT IF WE DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE, WE ARE STILL
LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING."

 

  "WE CAN'T KNOW THAT IN ADVANCE. THE VARYING ELECTRIC POTENTIALS IN
SBAPIROV'S MIND MUST RESEMBLE THOSE IN OURS AND WE MAY SIMPLY BE AWARE
OF HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WE ARE AWARE. IN ANY CASE, WE CAN'T
TELL UNLESS WE GO IN AND TRY."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, YOU WILL HAVE TO BE READY FOR POSSIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT."

 

  "NEVER," SAID KONEV WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS. "I INTEND TO BE THE
PERSON TO WHOM THE HUMAN BRAIN WILL FINALLY YIELD ITS SECRETS. I WILL
SOLVE, COMPLETELY, THE ULTIMATE PHYSIOLOGICAL MYSTERY OF HUMANITY,
PERHAPS OF THE UNIVERSE -- IF WE ARE THE MOST ADVANCED THINKING DEVICES
THAT EXIST ANYWHERE. SO WE WILL WORK TOGETHER, YOU AND I, TOMORROW. I
WANT YOU TO BE READY FOR IT, TO HELP GUIDE ME BY STUDYING CAREFULLY THE
BRAIN WAVES WE ENCOUNTER. I WANT YOU TO INTERPRET SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS
AND, MOST PARTICULARLY, HIS THOUGHTS ON COMBINING QUANTUM THEORY AND
RELATIVITY SO THAT TRIPS SUCH AS OURS TOMORROW CAN BECOME ROUTINE AND WE
CAN BEGIN THE STUDY OF THE BRAIN IN ALL EARNESTNESS."

 

  HE STOPPED AND STARED AT MORRISON INTENTLY, THEN SAID, "WELL?"

 

  "WELL, WHAT?"

 

  "DOES NONE OF THIS IMPRESS YOU?"

 

  "OF COURSE IT IMPRESSES ME, BUT ... I HAVE A QUESTION. TODAY WHEN I
WATCHED THE RABBIT BEING MINIATURIZED, THERE WAS A PRONOUNCED WHINE
DURING THE PROCESS -- AND A RUMBLE WHEN IT WAS DEMINIATURIZED. THERE WAS
NOTHING OF THE SORT WHEN I WAS SUBJECTED TO IT -- OR I WOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WAS HAPPENING."

 

  KONEV RAISED A FINGER, "AH. THE NOISE IS APPARENT WHEN YOU ARE IN REAL
SPACE, BUT NOT WHEN YOU ARE IN MINIATURIZED SPACE. I WAS THE FIRST TO
REALIZE THAT WAS SO WHEN I WAS MINIATURIZED AND I REPORTED IT. WE STILL
DON'T KNOW WHY THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD SEEMS TO STOP SOUND WAVES WHEN
IT DOESN'T STOP LIGHT WAVES, BUT THEN WE EXPECT TO LEARN NEW ASPECTS OF
THE PROCESS AS WE GO ON."

 

  "AS LONG AS WE DON'T DISCOVER FATAL ASPECTS," MUTTERED MORRISON. "ARE
YOU AFRAID OF NOTHING, YURI?"

 

  "I'M AFRAID OF NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE MY WORK. THAT WOULD BE TRUE
IF I DIED TOMORROW OR IF I REFUSED TO UNDERGO MINIATURIZATION. BEING
STOPPED BY DEATH, HOWEVER, IS ONLY A SMALL POSSIBILITY, BUT IF I REFUSE
TO UNDERGO MINIATURIZATION, THEN I AM STOPPED CERTAINLY. THAT IS WHY I
MUCH PREFER TO RISK THE FORMER THAN TAKE THE LATTER WAY OUT."

 

  "DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT SOPHIA WILL BE UNDERGOING MINIATURIZATION
WITH YOU?"

 

  KONEV FROWNED. "WHAT?"

 

  "IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER HER FIRST NAME, IT MAY HELP IF I REFER TO HER
AS KALIININ."

 

  "SHE IS PART OF THE GROUP AND WILL BE ON THE SHIP. YES."

 

  "AND YOU DON'T MIND?"

 

  "WHY SHOULD I?"

 

  "AFTER ALL, SHE FEELS YOU HAVE BETRAYED HER."

 

  KONEV FROWNED DARKLY AND A DULL FLUSH ROSE TO HIS FACE. "HAS HER
MADNESS GONE SO FAR AS TO FORCE HER TO CONFIDE HER INCOHERENCIES TO
STRANGERS? IF SHE WEREN'T NEEDED ON THIS PROJECT --"

 

  "I'M SORRY. SHE DIDN'T SOUND INCOHERENT TO ME."

 

  MORRISON DIDN'T KNOW WHY HE WAS PUSHING THE MATTER. PERHAPS HE FELT
DIMINISHED AT FEARING A TASK THE OTHER SO ARDENTLY WELCOMED AND HE
THEREFORE WISHED TO DIRNINISH IN TURN. "WERE YOU NEVER HER -- FRIEND?"

 

  "FRIEND?" KONEV'S FACE MIRRORED HIS CONTEMPT. "WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP?
WHEN I JOINED THE PROJECT, I FOUND HER HERE; SHE HAD JOINED A MONTH
EARLIER. WE WORKED TOGETHER, WE WERE NEW AND UNTRIED TOGETHER. OF
COURSE, THERE WAS WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL FRIENDSHIP, A PHYSICAL NEED FOR
INTIMACY. WHAT OF IT? WE WERE YOUNG AND UNSURE OF OURSELVES. IT WAS A
PASSING PHASE."

 

  "BUT IT LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND. A CHILD."

 

  "THAT WAS NOT MY DOING." AND HIS MOUTH CLOSED WITH A SNAP.

 

  "SHE SAYS --"

 

  "I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SADDLE ME WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY,
BUT IT WON'T WORK."

 

  "HAVE YOU CONSIDERED GENETIC ANALYSIS?"

 

  "NO! THE CHILD IS ADEQUATELY CARED FOR, I IMAGINE, AND EVEN IF GENETIC
ANALYSIS SEEMED TO INDICATE I MIGHT BE THE PARENT, I WOULD REFUSE ALL
EFFORTS TO TIE ME TO THE CHILD EMOTIONALLY, SO WHAT WOULD THE WOMAN HAVE
TO GAIN?"

 

  "ARE YOU SO COLDHEARTED?"

 

  "COLDHEARTED! WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE I HAVE DONE -- CORRUPTED A YOUNG,
INNOCENT VIRGIN? SHE TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN EVERYTHING. IN THE SAD STORY
THAT I SUPPOSE SHE TOLD YOU, DID SHE HAPPEN TO MENTION THAT SHE'D BEEN
PREGNANT BEFORE, THAT SHE HAD HAD AN ABORTION SOME YEARS BEFORE I MET
HER? I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER WAS THEN OR WHO IT IS NOW. PERHAPS
NEITHER DOES SHE -- EITHER TIME."

 

  "YOU ARE BEING UNKIND TO HER."

 

  "I AM NOT. SHE IS BEING UNKIND TO HERSELF. I HAVE A MISTRESS. I HAVE A
LOVE. IT IS THIS PROJECT. IT IS THE HUMAN BRAIN IN THE ABSTRACT, ITS
STUDY, ITS ANALYSIS, AND ALL THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO. THE WOMAN WAS, AT
BEST, A DISTRACTION -- AT WORST, A DESTRUCTION. THIS LITTLE TALK WE ARE
HAVING -- THAT I DID NOT ASK FOR -- THAT SHE GOADED YOU INTO
UNDERTAKING, NO DOUBT --"

 

  "SHE DID NOT," INTEDECTED MORRISON.

 

  "GOADS ARE NOT NECESSARILY NOTICED. THIS DISCUSSION MAY COST ME A
NIGHT'S SLEEP AND MAKE ME THAT MUCH LESS SHARP TOMORROW WHEN I WILL NEED
ALL MY SHARPNESS. IS THAT YOUR INTENTION?"

 

  "NO, OF COURSE NOT," MORRISON SAID QUIETLY.

 

  "THEN IT IS SURELY HERS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA IN HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
SHE HAS ATTEMPTED INTERFERENCE AND HOW OFTEN SHE HAS SUCCEEDED. I DON'T
LOOK AT HER, I DON'T SPEAK TO HER, YET SHE WILL NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. HER
IMAGINARY WRONGS SEEM AS FRESH IN HER MIND AS THEY WERE WHEN I FIRST
BROKE AWAY. YES, I DO MIND HER BEING ON THE SHIP WITH ME AND I HAVE SAID
SO TO BORANOVA, BUT SHE SAYS THAT BOTH OF US ARE NEEDED. ARE YOU
SATISFIED?"

 

  "I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU SO."

 

  "WHAT DID YOU MEAN? SIMPLY TO HAVE A QUIET CONVERSATION? 'SAY, WHAT
ABOUT ALL THOSE BETRAYALS AND DIRTY TRICKS YOU HAVE COMMITTED?' JUST A
FRIENDLY TALK?"

 

  MORRISON REMAINED SILENT, BOWING HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE OTHER'S
RAGE. THREE OUT OF FIVE ON THE SHIP -- HIMSELF AND THE TWO EX-LOVERS --
WOULD BE LABORING UNDER A SENSE OF UNBEARABLE WRONG. HE WONDERED IF, ON
CAREFUL QUESTIONING, DEZHNEV AND BORANOVA WOULD PROVE SIMILARLY
DISABLED.

 

  KONEV SAID HARSHLY, "YOU HAD BETTER GO. I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO BURY
YOUR FEAR OF THE PROJECT BY PROVIDING YOU WITH A BLAZE OF ENTHUSIASM.
OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE FAILED. YOU ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PRURIENT GOSSIP.
GO, THE GUARDS OUTSIDE THIS DOOR WILL TAKE YOU TO THE QUARTERS ASSIGNED
YOU. YOU WILL NEED TO SLEEP."

 

  MORRISON SIGHED. SLEEP?

 

  33.

 

  YET ON THIS, HIS THIRD NIGHT IN THE SOVIET UNION, MORRISON SLEPT.

 

  DEZHNEV HAD BEEN WAITING OUTSIDE KONEV'S ROOM WITH THE GUARDS, HIS
BROAD FACE GRINNING AND HIS LARGE EARS ALL BUT FLAPPING WITH MERRIMENT.
AFTER THE SHADOWED INTENSITY OF KONEV'S PERSONALITY, MORRISON FOUND
HIMSELF WELCOMING DEZHNEV'S CHATTER ON ALL SUBJECTS BUT THE MORROW'S
MINIATURIZATION.

 

  DEZHNEV URGED A DRINK ON HIM. "IT IS NOT VODKA, NOT ALCOHOL," HE HAD
SAID, "IT IS MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR AND FLAVORING. I STOLE IT FROM THE
COMMISSARY WHERE IT IS USED, I THINK, FOR ANIMALS, BECAUSE ALL THOSE
OFFICIALS FIND HUMAN BEINGS MORE EASILY REPLACEABLE THAN THE ANIMALS. IT
IS THE CURSE OF OVERPOPULATION. AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY, 'TO GET A
HUMAN BEING TAKES A MOMENT OF PLEASURE, BUT TO GET A HORSE COSTS MONEY.'
BUT DRINK. IT WILL SETTLE THE STOMACH. I PROMISE YOU."

 

  THE DRINK WAS IN A CAN WHICH MORRISON PUNCTURED. HE POURED IT INTO A
CUP THAT DEZHNEV PROFFERED AND IT TASTED FAIRLY GOOD. HE THANKED DEZHNEV
ALMOST CHEERILY.

 

  WHEN THEY GOT TO MORRISON'S ROOM, DEZHNEV SAID, "NOW THE IMPORTANT
THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO SLEEP. SLEEP WELL. LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE
EVERYTHING IS." AND AS HE DID SO, HE RATHER RESEMBLED A LARGE AND
SLIGHTLY UNKEMPT MOTHER HEN. WITH A HEARTY "GOOD NIGHT. BE SURE TO GET
PLENTY OF SLEEP," DEZHNEV LEFT THE ROOM.

 

  AND MORRISON SLEPT. ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WORKED HIMSELF INTO HIS
FAVORITE POSITION -- STOMACH DOWN, LEFT LEG BENT, KNEE OUTWARD -- HE
BEGAN TO FEEL SLEEPY. OF COURSE, HE HAD LITTLE SLEEP THE LAST TWO
NIGHTS, BUT HE SUDDENLY GUESSED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MILD SEDATIVE IN
THE CUP INTO WHICH HE HAD POURED THE DRINK. THEN CAME THE THOUGHT THAT
PERHAPS KONEV SHOULD TAKE SUCH A SEDATIVE. THEN -- NOTHING.

 

  WHEN HE WOKE, HE COULD NOT EVEN REMEMBER HAVING HAD ANY DREAMS.

 

  NOR DID HE WAKE OF HIS OWN ACCORD. DEZHNEV WAS SHAKING HIM, AS
CHEERFUL AS HE HAD BEEN THE EVENING BEFORE, AS WIDE AWAKE, AND EVEN AS
SPRUCED UP AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THAT ANIMATED HAYSTACK TO BE.

 

  HE SAID, "AWAKE, COMRADE AMERICAN, FOR IT IS TIME. YOU MUST SHAVE AND
WASH. THERE ARE FRESH TOWELS, COMBS, DEODORANTS, TISSUES, AND SOAP IN
THE BATHROOM. I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE DELIVERED THEM MYSELF. ALSO A NEW
ELECTRIC RAZOR. AND ON TOP OF THAT, NEW COTTON CLOTHES FOR YOU TO WEAR
WITH A REINFORCEMENT IN THE CROTCH SO YOU WILL NOT FEEL SO EXPOSED. THEY
ACTUALLY HAVE THEM, THE ROTTEN BUREAUCRATS, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO ASK --
WITH A FIST." AND HE RAISED HIS FIST WHILE TWISTING HIS FACE INTO A LOOK
OF FEROCITY.

 

  MORRISON STIRRED AND SAT UP ON THE BED. IT TOOK HIM A MOMENT TO PLACE
HIMSELF AND TO WEATHER THE SHOCK OF REALIZATION THAT IT WAS THURSDAY
MORNING AND THAT MINIATURIZATION WAS JUST AHEAD.

 

  HALF AN HOUR OR SO LATER, WHEN MORRISON STEPPED OUT OF THE BATHROOM
AGAIN -- SATISFACTORILY BATHED, DRIED, DEODORIZED, SHAVED, COMBED, AND
REACHING FOR HIS TWO-PIECE COTTON UNIFORM AND HIS SLIPPERS -- DEZHNEV
SAID, "SATISFACTORY ELIMINATION, MY LAD? NO CONSTIPATION?"

 

  "QUITE SATISFACTORY," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "GOOD! I DON'T ASK OUT OF IDLE CURIOSITY, OF COURSE. I AM NOT
FASCINATED BY EXCREMENT. IT IS JUST THAT THE SHIP IS NOT IDEALLY SUITED
FOR SUCH THINGS. BETTER WE ALL GO IN EMPTY. I DIDN'T TRUST TO NATURE,
MYSELF. I TOOK A BIT OF A LAXATIVE."

 

  "HOW LONG WILL WE STAY MINIATURIZED?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  "PERHAPS NOT LONG. AN HOUR IF WE ARE VERY LUCKY, PERHAPS TWELVE IF
WE'RE NOT."

 

  "BUT, LOOK," SAID MORRISON. "I CAN COUNT ON A WELL-BEHAVED COLON, BUT
I CAN'T GO FOR TWELVE HOURS WITHOUT URINATING."

 

  "WHO CAN?" ASKED DEZHNEV JOVIALLY. "EACH SEAT IN THE SHIP IS EQUIPPED
FOR THE EVENTUALITY. THERE IS A RECESS, A REMOVABLE COVER. A BUILT-IN
TOILET, SO TO SPEAK. I DESIGNED IT MYSELF. BUT IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE
AND, IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE, EMBARRASSING. SOMEDAY, THOUGH, WHEN THE
ENERGY-FREE MINIATURIZATION PROCESS IS A FACT, WE CAN BUILD OCEAN LINERS
FOR MINIATURIZATION AND LIVE IN THEM LIKE TSARS OF OLD."

 

  "WELL, LET'S HOPE THE EXPEDITION IS NOT UNNECESSARILY EXTENDED." (HE
FOUND IT ODD THAT, FOR A MOMENT, HIS APPREHENSION SHIFTED FROM FEARS OF
DEATH OR MENTAL DISABILITY TO THE DETAILS OF HOW TO MANIPULATE THE
TOILET LID AND HOW TO PROCEED AS UNOBTRUSIVELY AS POSSIBLE. -- IT
OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY GROSSNESSES AND
INDELICACIES, INVOLVED IN THE GREAT EXPLORATORY TRIPS OF THE PAST, ITEMS
THAT HAD GONE UNDETAILED AND, THEREFORE, UNNOTED.)

 

  HE WAS IN HIS COTTON CLOTHES AND HAD STEPPED INTO HIS SLIPPERS WHEN
DEZHNEV, DRESSED IN SLIGHTLY LARGER VERSIONS OF THE SAME (ALSO WITH
REFINEMENT IN THE CROTCH), SAID, "LET US NOW GO TO BREAKFAST. WE WILL
HAVE GOOD FOOD, HIGH CALORIES, AND LOW BULK, FOR THERE WILL BE NO EATING
ON BOARD THE SHIP. THERE'LL BE WATER, OF COURSE, AND FRUIT JUICES, BUT
NO REAL BEVERAGES OF ANY KIND. THE SWEET NATASHA MADE A TERRIBLE FACE
WHEN I SUGGESTED WE MIGHT NEED A DROP OF VODKA NOW AND THEN. THERE WERE
A LOT OF UNCALLED-FOR COMMENTS ABOUT SOTS AND DRUNKARDS. ALBERT, ALBERT,
HOW I AM PERSECUTED -- AND UNJUSTLY, TOO."

 

  BREAKFAST WAS INDEED PLENTIFUL, BUT NOT EXACTLY FILLING. THERE WAS
GELATIN AND CUSTARD, THICK SLABS OF WHITE BREAD WITH BUTTER AND
MARMALADE, FRUIT JUICES, AND SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PILLS TO BE SLUICED
DOWN.

 

  THE TALK OVER THE BREAKFAST TABLE WAS MODERATELY ANIMATED AND, FOR THE
MOST PART, DEALT WITH THE LOCAL CHESS TOURNAMENT. THERE WAS NO MENTION
OF THE SHIP OR OF MINIATURIZATION. (WAS IT BAD LUCK TO MENTION THE
PROJECT?)

 

  MORRISON DID NOT OBJECT TO THE DIRECTION OF COMMENT. HE EVEN MADE A
FEW COMMENTS ABOUT HIS OWN ADVENTURES AS A CHESS PLAYER OF MARKED LACK
OF RENOWN.

 

  AND THEN, ALL TOO SOON, THE TABLE WAS BEING CLEARED AND IT WAS TIME.

 

  THEY LEFT FOR THE SHIP.

 

  34.

 

  THEY WALKED IN SINGLE FILE, WITH SPACE BETWEEN THEMSELVES. DEZHNEV WAS
FIRST, THEN KALIININ, THEN BORANOVA, THEN MORRISON, AND FINALLY KONEV.

 

  ALMOST AT ONCE, MORRISON UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE. THEY WERE ON VIEW AND
THEY WERE BEING INDIVIDUALIZED. ALONG THE EDGES OF THE CORRIDOR WERE MEN
AND WOMEN -- EMPLOYEES OF THE PROJECT, OBVIOUSLY -- WATCHING EAGERLY.

 

  THEY, AT LEAST, MUST KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, EVEN IF THE REST OF THE
SOVIET UNION (LET ALONE THE WORLD) DID NOT.

 

  DREZHNEV, IN FRONT, WAVED EAGERLY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT, RATHER IN THE
FASHION OF A KINDLY AND POPULAR MONARCH, AND THE CROWDS RESPONDED
APPROPRIATELY, SHOUTING, WAVING, AND CALLING OUT HIS NAME.

 

  EACH NAME WAS CALLED AT VARIOUS TIMES, FOR OBVIOUSLY EACH PROSPECTIVE
CREW MEMBER WAS KNOWN TO ALL. THE TWO WOMEN WERE RESTRAINED IN THEIR
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND KONEV (AS MORRISON COULD SEE WHEN HE LOOKED BEHIND
HIM) WAS, NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, MOVING ALONG, EYES FORWARD AND UNRESPONSIVE.

 

  AND THEN MORRISON WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CRY, IN
ENGLISH, "HURRAH, THE AMERICAN!"

 

  HE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OUTCRY AND AUTOMATICALLY WAVED, AT
WHICH, JUST AS AUTOMATICALLY, THERE WAS A LOUD AND ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT
AND THE WORDS WERE PICKED UP UNTIL "HURRAH, THE AMERICAN!" DROWNED OUT
ALL ELSE.

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS EARLIER SULLEN
RESIGNATION. HE HAD NEVER BEEN THE OBJECT OF MOB JUBILATION AND HE TOOK
TO IT IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT TROUBLE, WAVING AND GRINNING MADLY. HE
CAUGHT BORANOVA'S GRAVELY AMUSED EXPRESSION AND SAW DEZHNEV POINTING HIS
FINGER AT HIM IN AN OSTENTATIOUS THAT'S-THE-AMERICAN GESTURE, BUT
ALLOWED NEITHER ACTION TO DISTURB HIM.

 

  AND THEN THEY PASSED OUT OF THE LINE OF OBSERVERS AND INTO THE LARGE
ROOM IN WHICH SHAPIROV WAS RESTING IN HIS MENTAL COCOON OF COMA. THE
SHIP WAS ALSO IN THE ROOM.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND WITH ASTONISHMENT. HE SAID, "THERE'S A CAMERA
CREW OUT THERE."

 

  KALIININ WAS NOW STANDING NEXT TO HIM. (HOW BEAUTIFUL HER BREASTS ARE,
MORRISON THOUGHT. THEY WERE VEILED BUT NOT HIDDEN BY THE THIN COTTON AND
HE COULD SEE WHY KONEV HAD REFERRED TO HER AS A DISTRACTION.) SHE SAID,
"OH YES, WE'LL BE ON TELEVISION. EVERY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIMENT IS
CAREFULLY RECORDED AND THERE ARE REPORTERS AT EACH OCCASION SO THAT IT
MIGHT BE DESCRIBED. THERE WAS EVEN A CAMERA PRESENT WHEN YOU AND I WERE
MINIATURIZED YESTERDAY, BUT WE KEPT IT OUT OF SIGHT SINCE YOU WEREN'T TO
KNOW YOU WERE TO UNDERGO THE PROCESS."

 

  "BUT IF THIS IS A SECRET PROJECT --"

 

  "IT WILL NOT ALWAYS BE SECRET. SOMEDAY, WHEN WE HAVE REACHED FULL
SUCCESS, THE DETAILS OF OUR PROGRESS WILL BE REVEALED TO OUR PEOPLE AND
TO THE WORLD. -- SOONER, IF IT SEEMS SOME OTHER NATION IS MAKING
PROGRESS ON ITS OWN IN THE SAME DIRECTION."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "IT ISN'T GOOD, THIS PRIMARY CONCERN WITH
PRIORITY. PROGRESS WOULD BE MUCH FASTER IF ADDITIONAL BRAINS AND
RESOURCES WERE PUT ON THE JOB."

 

  KALIININ SAID, "WOULD YOU WILLINGLY GIVE UP PRIORITY IN YOUR OWN FIELD
OF RESEARCH?"

 

  MORRISON WAS SILENT. IT WAS THE OBVIOUS RETORT.

 

  KALIININ, NOTING THIS, SAID WITH A SHAKE OF HER HEAD, "I THOUGHT SO.
IT IS EASY TO BE GENEROUS WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY."

 

  BORANOVA, MEANWHILE, WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE WHOM MORRISON JUDGED TO BE
A REPORTER, ONE WHO WAS LISTENING EAGERLY. MORRISON TRANSFERRED HIS
ATTENTION AND FOUND HIMSELF LISTENING EAGERLY, TOO.

 

  BORANOVA WAS SAYING, "THIS IS THE AMERICAN SCIENTIST, ALBERT JONAS
MORRISON, WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF NEUROPHYSICS, WHICH IS, OF COURSE,
ACADEMICIAN KONEV'S FIELD. HE IS HERE SERVING AS BOTH AN AMERICAN
OBSERVER AND AS AN ASSISTANT TO ACADEMICIAN KONEV."

 

  "AND THERE WILL BE FIVE WHO WILL BE ON THE SHIP?"

 

  "YES. AND THERE WILL NEVER BE SO REMARKABLE A FIVE AGAIN -- OR SO
REMARKABLE AN EVENT -- IF MINIATURIZATION LASTS A MILLION YEARS.
ACADEMICIAN KONEV IS THE VERY FIRST HUMAN BEING EVER TO HAVE UNDERGONE
MINIATURIZATION. DR. SOPHIA KALIININ IS THE FIRST WOMAN AND PROFESSOR
ALBERT MORRISON IS THE FIRST AMERICAN EVER TO HAVE UNDERGONE
MINIATURIZATION. KALIININ AND MORRISON REPRESENT THE FIRST MULTIPLE
MINIATURIZATION AND WERE THE FIRST TO BE MINIATURIZED IN THE SHIP. AND
AS FOR TODAY'S VOYAGE, THIS WILL REPRESENT THE FIRST MINIATURIZATION OF
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS AT ONCE AND IT WILL BE THE FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH A
MINIATURIZED SHIP AND ITS CREW WILL BE INSERTED INTO A LIVING HUMAN
BEING. THE HUMAN BEING INTO WHOM WE WILL BE INSERTED IS, OF COURSE,
ACADEMICIAN PYOTR SHAPIROV, WHO WAS THE SECOND HUMAN BEING TO BE
MINIATURIZED AND THE FIRST TO BE A CASUALTY OF THE PROCESS."

 

  DEZHNEV, WHO WAS SUDDENLY AT MORRISON'S SIDE, WHISPERED HOARSELY INTO
HIS EAR, "THERE YOU ARE, ALBERT. YOU ARE NOW AN INDELIBLE FOOTNOTE IN
HISTORY. YOU MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED UNTIL NOW THAT YOU WERE A FAILURE, BUT
NOT SO. NO ONE CAN TAKE FROM YOU THE FACT THAT YOU WERE THE FIRST
AMERICAN EVER TO BE MINIATURIZED. EVEN IF YOUR COUNTRYMEN WORK OUT THE
MINIATURIZATION PROCESS ON THEIR OWN AND MINIATURIZE AN AMERICAN, THAT
AMERICAN CAN BE NO BETTER THAN SECOND."

 

  MORRISON HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT. HE WAS TASTING THIS NEWFOUND AND
PERMANENT PERSONAL STATISTIC (IF THE SOVIETS WOULD SOMEDAY RELEASE
NATALYA'S STATEMENT, UNDISTORTED AND UNREWRITTEN) AND HE FOUND IT
SAVORY.

 

  YET HE WAS NOT SATISFIED. "IT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED
FOR."

 

  "DO A GOOD JOB ON THIS JOURNEY WE ARE TO TAKE AND YOU WILL END UP
BEING KNOWN FOR MUCH MORE," SAID DEZHNEV. "BESIDES, AS MY OLD FATHER
USED TO SAY, 'IT IS GOOD TO BE AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE, EVEN IF ONLY
ONE OTHER SITS WITH YOU AND THERE IS BUT A BOWL OF CABBAGE SOUP TO
SHARE.'"

 

  DEZHNEV STEPPED AWAY AND NOW KALIININ WAS AGAIN AT MORRISON'S SIDE.
SHE TUGGED AT HIS SLEEVE AND SAID, "ALBERT."

 

  "YES, SOPHIA?"

 

  "YOU WERE WITH HIM AFTER DINNER LAST NIGHT, WEREN'T YOU?"

 

  "HE SHOWED ME A MAP OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN. MARVELOUS!"

 

  "DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME?"

 

  MORRISON HESITATED. "WHY SHOULD HE HAVE?"

 

  "BECAUSE YOU ARE A CURIOUS MAN, TRYING TO ESCAPE YOUR OWN PRIVATE
DEVILS. YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED."

 

  MORRISON WINCED AT HER CHARACTERIZATION OF HIM. HE SAID, "HE DEFENDED
HIMSELF."

 

  "HOW?"

 

  "HE MENTIONED AN EARLIER PREGNANCY -- AND -- AND ABORTION. IT WAS NOT
SOMETHING I WOULD BELIEVE, SOPHIA, UNLESS YOU ADMITTED IT."

 

  KALIININ'S EYES BECAME BRIGHT WITH GATHERING TEARS. "DID HE---DID HE
DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES?"

 

  "NO, SOPHIA. NOR DID I ASK."

 

  "HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU. I WAS FORCED WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN. IT HAD
UNDESIRABLE CONSEQUENCES AND MY PARENTS TOOK LEGAL MEASURES."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND. PERHAPS YURI CHOOSES NOT TO BELIEVE THIS."

 

  "HE MAY CHOOSE TO THINK THAT I ASKED FOR IT, BUT IT IS ALL ON THE
RECORD AND THE RAPIST IS STILL IN PRISON. SOVIET LAW IS HARD ON
OFFENDERS OF THIS TYPE, BUT ONLY IF THE SITUATION CAN BE THOROUGHLY
PROVEN. I RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WOMEN CAN FALSELY ACCUSE MEN OF RAPE,
BUT THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS AND YURI KNOWS IT. HOW COWARDLY
OF HIM TO STATE THE FACT WITHOUT THE EXTENUATION."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "NEVERTHELESS, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS, ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY IT MUST AFFECT YOU. WE WILL
HAVE A COMPLICATED JOB TO DO INSIDE THE SHIP AND IT WILL NEED ALL OUR
CONCENTRATION AND SKILL. I ASSURE YOU, THOUGH, THAT I AM ON YOUR SIDE
AND NOT ON HIS."

 

  KALIININ NODDED AND SAID, "I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY,
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME. I WILL DO MY JOB."

 

  AT THIS POINT, BORANOVA CALLED OUT, "WE ARE NOW TO ENTER THE SHIP IN
THE ORDER IN WHICH I CALL YOUR NAMES: DEZHNEV -- KONEV -- KALIININ --
MORRISON -- AND MYSELF."

 

  BORANOVA MOVED IMMEDIATELY INTO POSITION BEHIND HIM AND MURMURED, "HOW
DO YOU FEEL, ALBERT?"

 

  "TERRIBLE," SAID MORRISON. "DID YOU EXPECT ANY OTHER ANSWER?"

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA. "BUT, NEVERTHELESS, I EXPECT YOU TO DO YOUR WORK
AS THOUGH YOU DIDN'T FEEL LOUSY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

 

  "I WILL TRY," SAID MORRISON THROUGH STIFF LIPS AND, FOLLOWING
KALIININ, HE ENTERED THE SHIP A SECOND TIME.

 

  35.

 

  ONE BY ONE, THEY HAD TO ADJUST THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SEATS IN THE
ARRANGEMENT THAT KALIININ HAD DESCRIBED THE DAY BEFORE. DEZHNEV WAS
FRONT LEFT AT THE CONTROLS, KONEV FRONT RIGHT, KALIININ MID-LEFT,
MORRISON MID-RIGHT, AND BORANOVA REAR LEFT.

 

  MORRISON BLINKED HIS EYES AND BLEW HIS NOSE INTO A TISSUE HE FOUND IN
ONE OF HIS POCKETS. WHAT IF HE NEEDED MORE TISSUES THAN HAD BEEN
SUPPLIED HIM? (A SILLY THING TO WORRY ABOUT, BUT IT WAS A MORE
COMFORTABLE WORRY THAN SOME HE MIGHT HAVE.) HIS FOREHEAD FELT DAMP. WAS
THAT BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS? WOULD FIVE PEOPLE BREATHING --
HYPERVENTILATING, PERHAPS -- INTO A SKIMPY VOLUME RAISE THE HUMIDITY TO
MAXIMUM? OR WOULD THERE BE SUFFICIENT VENTILATION?

 

  HE THOUGHT SUDDENLY OF THE FIRST ASTRONAUTS OF A CENTURY BEFORE --
EVEN MORE CONSTRICTED, MORE HELPLESS -- BUT GOING INTO A SPACE THAT WAS
SOMEWHAT KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD, NOT INTO A MICROCOSM THAT WAS UTTERLY
VIRGIN TERRITORY.

 

  YET, AS MORRISON SAT DOWN, HE FELT THE EDGE OF TERROR DULLED. HE HAD,
AFTER ALL, BEEN IN THE SHIP BEFORE. HE HAD EVEN BEEN MINIATURIZED AND
DEMINIATURIZED AND WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR IT. IT DIDN'T HURT.

 

  HE LOOKED AROUND TO SEE HOW THE OTHERS WERE TAKING IT. KALIININ, TO
HIS LEFT, LOOKED COLDLY BLANK. A RATHER ICY LOVELINESS. IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN IMPRESSIVE THAT SHE WAS SHOWING NO FEAR, NO ANXIETY, BUT (AS SHE
HAD SAID OF HIM) SHE WAS PROBABLY SITTING THERE FIGHTING HER PRIVATE
DEVILS.

 

  DEZHNEV WAS LOOKING BACK, PERHAPS TRYING TO WEIGH REACTIONS AS
MORRISON WAS, AND VERY LIKELY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. MORRISON WAS TRYING
TO BOLSTER WHAT LITTLE INNER COURAGE HE COULD FIND BY BORROWING FROM
THAT OF OTHERS, WHEREAS DEZHNEV (MORRISON THOUGHT) WAS WEIGHING
RESPONSES IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE POSSIBLE SUCCESS OF THE MISSION.

 

  KONEV FACED DIRECTLY FORWARD AND MORRISON COULD SEE ONLY THE BACK OF
HIS NECK. BORANOVA WAS JUST SEATING HERSELF AND WAS STRAIGHTENING HER
FLIMSY COTTON COSTUME.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "FRIENDS. FELLOW-TRAVELERS. BEFORE WE CAN LEAVE, WE MUST
EACH INSPECT OUR EQUIPMENT. ONCE WE START, TELLING ME SOMETHING DOESN'T
WORK IS NOT GOING TO STRIKE ME AS AN UPROARIOUS JOKE. AS MY FATHER USED
TO SAY, 'THE TRULY WISE TRAPEZE ARTIST DOES NOT INSPECT HIS NAILS IN
MID-JUMP.' IT WILL BE MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHIP'S CONTROLS ARE
IN ORDER, AS I AM PARTICULARLY CERTAIN THEY ARE, SINCE I DESIGNED THEM
MYSELF AND SUPERVISED THE CONSTRUCTION.

 

  "AS FOR YOU, YURI, MY FRIEND, YOUR CEREB-WHATEVER-YOU-CALL-IT -- OR
YOUR BRAIN MAP, AS ANYONE WITH SENSE WOULD CALL IT -- HAS BEEN
TRANSFERRED POINT FOR POINT INTO THE SOFTWARE OF YOUR COMPUTER BEHIND
THE PLATE BEFORE YOU. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THE
PLATE AND THEN SEE IF THE BRAIN MAP IS FUNCTIONAL IN ALL RESPECTS.

 

  "SOPHIA, MY LITTLE DOVE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU DO EXCEPT THAT
YOU MAKE ELECTRICITY, THEREFORE MAKE SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE STYLE
YOU WILL FIND SUITABLE. NATALYA," HIS VOICE LIFTED SLIGHTLY, "ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT BACK THERE?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I AM PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT. PLEASE CHECK ALBERT. HE
NEEDS YOUR HELP MOST."

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID DEZHNEV. "I HAVE LEFT HIM FOR LAST, SO THAT HE CAN
GET MY FULL ATTENTION. ALBERT, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THE PANEL
BEFORE YOU?"

 

  "OF COURSE NOT," MORRISON SNAPPED. "HOW SHOULD I KNOW?"

 

  "IN TWO SECONDS, YOU WILL KNOW. THIS CONTACT IS TO OPEN AND THAT
CONTACT IS TO CLOSE. ALBERT, OPEN! -- AH, YOU SEE, IT SLIDES OPEN
NOISELESSLY. NOW CLOSE! PERFECT. NOW YOU KNOW. -- AND HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT
IS INSIDE THE RECESS?"

 

  "A COMPUTER," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "PERFECT AGAIN, BUT DO ME A FAVOR AND SEE IF IT IS A COMPUTER
EQUIVALENT TO YOURS. YOUR PROGRAMMED SOFTWARE IS IN THE RECESS TO THE
SIDE. PLEASE CHECK IT OUT, MAKE SURE IT FITS THE COMPUTER, AND MAKE SURE
IT WORKS AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. I WILL RELY ON YOU TO TELL ME IF IT
IS WORKING PROPERLY. PLEASE! IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS, ANY SUSPICION, THE
TINIEST HINT THAT SOMETHING IS NOT JUST SO, WE WILL DELAY UNTIL IT IS
FIXED TO YOUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "PLEASE, ARKADY, NO DRAMATICS. THERE IS NO TIME."

 

  DEZHNEV IGNORED HER. "BUT IF YOU TELL ME THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THAT
REALLY ISN'T WRONG, MY GOOD ALBERT, YURI WILL FIND OUT, I ASSURE YOU,
AND NEITHER HE, NOR I, NOR ANYONE WILL BE PLEASED. SO IF IT OCCURS TO
YOU THAT INVENTING A TROUBLE MAY DELAY THE TRIP OR EVEN CANCEL IT, LET
IT UNOCCUR TO YOU AT ONCE."

 

  MORRISON COULD FEEL HIS FACE FLUSHING AND HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE
INTERPRETED AS THE RESULT OF A GENEROUS ANGER OVER THE THOUGHT THAT HE
MIGHT BE DISHONEST IN THIS FASHION AND NOT AS GUILT OVER A FOILED PLOT.

 

  ACTUALLY, AS HE HOVERED OVER HIS COMPUTER, HE THOUGHT AGAIN OF WHAT
HIS DESIGN AND REPEATED REDESIGN OF HIS PROGRAM HAD DONE. NOW AND THEN,
THESE MOST RECENT DESIGNS OF HIS HAD BROUGHT HIM -- FEELINGS. IT WAS NOT
SOMETHING HE COULD IDENTIFY, BUT IT FELT AS THOUGH HIS OWN THOUGHT
CENTERS WERE BEING DIRECTLY STIMULATED BY THE BRAIN WAVES HE WAS
ANALYZING. HE HAD NOT REPORTED THESE, BUT HE HAD OCCASIONALLY TALKED
ABOUT IT AND THE WORD HAD GOTTEN OUT. SHAPIROV HAD CALLED HIS PROGRAM A
RELAY STATION BECAUSE OF THAT -- IF YURI WAS TO BE BELIEVED. WELL, THEN,
HOW COULD HE NOW CHECK IF THAT WERE WORKING WELL, WHEN AT BEST HE HAD
HAD THE SENSATION ONLY A FEW TIMES AND AT UNPREDICTABLE OCCASIONS?

 

  OR MIGHT IT ALL BE SIMPLY THE WILL-TO-BELIEVE, THE SAME WILL THAT HAD
LED PERCIVAL LOWELL TO SEE CANALS ON MARS?

 

  HE REALIZED THAT IT HADN'T ACTUALLY EVEN OCCURRED TO HIM TO TRY TO
STYMIE THE VOYAGE BY SAYING HIS PROGRAM WASN'T WORKING. DEARLY AS HE
LONGED TO AVOID THE RISK, HE COULD NOT DO SO AT THE COST OF VILIFYING
HIS PROGRAM.

 

  AND THEN THERE WAS SUDDENLY CAUSE FOR A BIT OF FRESH PANIC WITHIN
MORRISON'S HEART. WHAT IF THE PROGRAM HAD BEEN DAMAGED SOMEHOW IN
TRANSIT? HOW COULD HE PERSUADE THEM THAT THERE WAS TRULY SOMETHING WRONG
AND THAT HE WAS NOT SIMPLY PRETENDING?

 

  BUT IT ALL WORKED BEAUTIFULLY, AT LEAST AS FAR AS HE COULD TELL
WITHOUT IT BEING IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH A SKULL BEHIND WHICH AN ACTIVE
BRAIN EXISTED.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, AS HE WATCHED MORRISON'S HANDS WORKING, "WE HAVE PLACED
NEW BATTERIES IN IT. AMERICAN BATTERIES."

 

  "EVERYTHING IS WORKING PROPERLY," SAID MORRISON, "AS FAR AS I CAN
SEE."

 

  "GOOD. IS EVERYONE SATISFIED WITH THE EQUIPMENT? THEN LIFT YOUR PRETTY
REARS FROM YOUR SEATS AND CHECK THE SLIDING PANELS THERE. DO THEY WORK?
BELIEVE ME, YOU WOULD ALL BE VERY UNHAPPY IF THEY DIDN'T."

 

  MORRISON WATCHED KALIININ OPEN AND CLOSE THE PANEL (COVERED WITH A
THIN LAYER OF UPHOLSTERY) THAT SHE WAS SITTING ON. HIS OWN WORKED
SIMILARLY WHEN HE IMITATED HER MOTIONS.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "IT WILL TAKE SOLID WASTES, TOO, WITHIN REASON, BUT LET
US HOPE WE WILL HAVE NO OCCASION TO CHECK THAT OUT. IN CASE THE WORST
COMES TO THE WORST, THERE IS A SMALL ROLL OF TISSUE JUST UNDER THE EDGE
OF YOUR SEAT, WHERE YOU CAN REACH IT EASILY. AS WE MINIATURIZE,
EVERYTHING LOSES MASS, SO EXCRETIONS WOULD FLOAT. THERE WILL, HOWEVER,
BE A DOWNWARD CURRENT OF AIR TO PREVENT THAT. DON'T LET THE DRAFT
STARTLE YOU. THERE IS A LITER OF WATER IN A TINY REFRIGERATOR UNDER THE
SIDE OF YOUR SEAT. IT IS ONLY FOR DRINKING. IF YOU GET DIRTY OR SWEATY
OR SMELLY, JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO STAY THAT WAY. NO WASHING UNTIL WE
GET OUT. AND NO EATING. IF WE LOSE A FEW OUNCES, SO MUCH THE BETTER."

 

  BORANOVA SAID DRYLY, "IF YOU LOST SEVEN KILOGRAMS, ARKADY, SO MUCH THE
BETTER. AND WE WOULD CONSUME LESS ENERGY IN THE MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "THE THOUGHT HAS OCCURRED TO ME AT TIMES, NATASHA," REPLIED DEZHNEV
COOLLY. "I WILL NOW TEST THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIP AND IF ALL RESPONDS
PROPERLY, AS I'M SURE IT WILL, WE WILL BE READY TO BEGIN."

 

  THERE WAS WHAT SEEMED TO MORRISON TO BE A TENSE WAIT IN UTTER SILENCE,
EXCEPT FOR A SOFT WHISTLE BETWEEN THE TEETH ON THE PART OF DEZHNEV, AS
HE BENT OVER HIS CONTROLS.

 

  THEN DEZHNEV SAT UP, WIPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS SLEEVE, AND SAID,
"ALL IS WELL. COMRADE LADIES, COMRADE GENTLEMAN, AND COMRADE AMERICAN,
THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE WE FACE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN." HE FIXED AN AUDITOR IN
HIS LEFT EAR, RAISED A TINY MICROPHONE BEFORE HIS MOUTH, AND SAID, "ALL
IS OPERATIONAL WITHIN. IS ALL OPERATIONAL OUTSIDE? -- VERY WELL, THEN,
WISH US GOOD FORTUNE, COMRADES ALL."

 

  NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN AND MORRISON CAST A QUICK LOOK AT KALIININ.
SHE WAS STILL IMMOBILE, BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF MORRISON'S HEAD
TURNING TOWARD HER, FOR SHE SAID, "YES, WE ARE MINIATURIZING."

 

  THE BLOOD ROARED IN MORRISON'S EARS. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE WAS
CONSCIOUSLY MINIATURIZING.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 9 -- ARTERY

 

  IF THE CURRENT FLOW IS TAKING YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO, DON'T ARGUE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  36.

 

  MORRISON'S EYES REMAINED, FOR THE MOST PART, FOCUSED ON THE RECESS
BEFORE HIM, ON THE COMPUTER, AND ON THE SOFTWARE HE HAD INSERTED. THE
SOFTWARE -- THE ONE MATERIAL OBJECT OF THE LONG AGO.

 

  LONG AGO? IT WAS LESS THAN A HUNDRED HOURS AGO THAT HE WAS HALF-DOZING
HIS WAY THROUGH A DULL TALK ON HIS LAST DAY AT THE CONFERENCE AND
WONDERING WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WAY TO SAVE HIS POSITION AT THE
UNIVERSITY. AND NOW A HUNDRED SUBJECTIVE YEARS HAD PASSED IN THOSE
HUNDRED OBJECTIVE HOURS AND HE COULD NO LONGER CLEARLY VISUALIZE THE
UNIVERSITY AT ALL OR THE LIFE OF SAD FRUSTRATION HE HAD BEEN LEADING
THERE TOWARD THE END.

 

  HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE BROKEN OUT OF THE DULL CYCLE
OF USELESS STRIVING A HUNDRED HOURS AGO. HE WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL MORE
-- A GREAT DEAL MORE -- TO BREAK BACK INTO IT NOW, TO WAKE UP AND TO
FIND THE LAST HUNDRED HOURS (OR YEARS) HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE.

 

  HE GLANCED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT WALL OF THE SHIP, THERE AT HIS
RIGHT ELBOW, HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED AS THOUGH HE WERE REALLY RELUCTANT TO
SEE ANYTHING. HE WAS RELUCTANT. HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE ANYTHING LARGER
THAN IT SHOULD BE. IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HIS WILD HOPE THAT THE
MINIATURIZATION PROCESS HAD BROKEN DOWN OR THAT THE WHOLE THING HAD --
SOMEHOW -- BEEN AN ILLUSION.

 

  BUT A MAN WALKED INTO HIS VIEW -- TALL, OVER TWO METERS TALL. BUT
THEN, PERHAPS HE WAS ACTUALLY THAT TALL.

 

  OTHERS APPEARED. THEY COULDN'T ALL BE THAT TALL.

 

  HE SHRANK DOWN INTO HIS SEAT AND LOOKED NO MORE. IT WAS ENOUGH. HE
KNEW THAT THE MINIATURIZATION PROCESS WAS GOING ITS INEXORABLE WAY.

 

  THE SILENCE INSIDE THE SHIP WAS OPPRESSIVE, UNBEARABLE. MORRISON FELT
HE HAD TO HEAR A VOICE, EVEN IF ONLY HIS OWN.

 

  KALIININ, AT HIS LEFT SIDE, WAS THE ONE TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK MOST
EASILY AND SHE MIGHT BE THE BEST OF A DIFFICULT CHOICE, PERHAPS. SINCE
MORRISON DID NOT WANT DEZHNEV'S MISPLACED JOCULARITY, OR BORANOVA'S
ONE-DIMENSIONAL CONCENTRATION, OR KONEV'S DARK INTENSITY, HE TURNED TO
KALIININ'S FROZEN SORROW.

 

  HE SAID, "HOW WILL WE GET INTO SHAPIROV'S BODY, SOPHIA?"

 

  IT TOOK A WHILE, IT SEEMED, FOR KALIININ TO HEAR HIM. WHEN SHE DID,
HER LIPS MOVED PALLIDLY AND SHE SAID IN A WHISPER, "INJECTION."

 

  THEN, AS THOUGH WITH A SUPREME EFFORT, SHE APPARENTLY DECIDED THAT SHE
MUST BE COMPANIONABLE, SO SHE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID, "WHEN WE ARE SMALL
ENOUGH, WE WILL BE PLACED INTO A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE AND INJECTED INTO
ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV'S LEFT CAROTID ARTERY."

 

  "WE'LL BE SHAKEN UP LIKE DICE," SAID MORRISON, APPALLED.

 

  "NOT AT ALL. IT WILL BE COMPLEX, BUT THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN THOUGHT
THROUGH."

 

  "HOW DO YOU KNOW? THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. NEVER IN A SHIP.
NEVER IN A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE, NEVER INTO A HUMAN BODY."

 

  "TRUE," SAID KALIININ, "BUT PROBLEMS LIKE THIS -- MUCH SIMPLER ONES,
OF COURSE -- HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE HAD EXTENDED
SEMINARS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS ON THIS MISSION. YOU DON'T THINK THAT
ARKADY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS BEFORE MINIATURIZATION BEGAN -- THE ONES ABOUT
TOILET TISSUE AND SO ON -- WERE NEW TO US, DO YOU? WE HAVE HEARD IT ALL
BEFORE, OVER AND OVER. IT WAS FOR YOUR BENEFIT, ACTUALLY, SINCE YOU HAVE
ATTENDED NO SEMINARS, AND FOR ARKADY'S, TOO, SINCE HE LOVES HIS MOMENT
IN THE SUN."

 

  "TELL ME, THEN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?"

 

  "I WILL EXPLAIN EVENTS AS THEY OCCUR. FOR NOW WE DO NOTHING UNTIL WE
ARE IN THE CENTIMETER RANGE. IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES, BUT
NOT EVERYTHING WILL BE SO SLOW. THE SMALLER WE GET, THE FASTER WE CAN
MINIATURIZE, IN PROPORTION. -- HAVE YOU FELT ANY BAD EFFECTS YET?"

 

  MORRISON MENTALLY SUBTRACTED THE RAPID BEATING OF HIS HEART AND THE
PANTING OF HIS LUNGS AND SAID, "NONE." THEN, FEELING THAT TO BE AN
UNDULY OPTIMISTIC REMARK, HE ADDED, "AT LEAST SO FAR."

 

  "WELL, THEN?" SAID KALIININ AND CLOSED HER EYES AS THOUGH TO INDICATE
THAT SHE WAS TIRED OF TALKING.

 

  MORRISON THOUGHT THAT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA AND CLOSED HIS AS
WELL.

 

  HE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY FALLEN ASLEEP OR HE MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE GONE INTO
A PROTECTIVE STATE OF SEMI UNCONSCIOUSNESS, WITHDRAWING FROM REALITY,
FOR IT SEEMED THAT NO TIME HAD PASSED WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO BY A SLIGHT
JAR.

 

  HE OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND FOUND HIMSELF A CENTIMETER OR SO ABOVE THE
SEAT. HE HAD THE ODD SENSATION OF DRIFTING WITH EACH VAGRANT PUFF OF
WIND.

 

  BORANOVA HAD MOVED OVER TO THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND PLACED HER HANDS ON
HIS SHOULDERS. SHE PUSHED DOWN GENTLY AND SAID, "ALBERT, PUT ON YOUR
SEAT BELT. SOPHIA, SHOW HIM HOW. I'M SORRY, ALBERT -- WE SHOULD HAVE
GONE OVER ALL OF THIS -- EVERYTHING -- BEFORE WE STARTED, BUT WE HAD
LITTLE TIME AND YOU WERE NERVOUS ENOUGH AS IT WAS. WE DID NOT WISH TO
REDUCE YOU TO UTTER HELPLESSNESS BY FLOODING YOU WITH INFORMATION."

 

  TO HIS OWN SURPRISE, MORRISON HAD NOT BEEN FEELING HELPLESS. HE HAD
RATHER ENJOYED THE SENSATION OF SITTING ON AIR.

 

  KALIININ TOUCHED A SPOT ON HER SEAT EDGE BETWEEN HER KNEES AND A BELT
AROUND HER WAIST FLIPPED AWAY. IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE, MORRISON WAS SURE,
WHEN HE HAD CLOSED HIS EYES AND NOW IT WAS AGAIN NO LONGER THERE, FOR IT
DISAPPEARED, WITH A SNAP, INTO A RECESS IN THE SEAT TO HER LEFT. SHE
TWISTED TOWARD MORRISON AND SAID, "THIS, HERE TO YOUR LEFT, IS YOUR BELT
EJECTOR." MORRISON COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THAT, NOW UNBOUND, SHE LIFTED
UP FROM HER SEAT SLIGHTLY AS SHE MOVED TOWARD HIM.

 

  SHE PRESSED THE EJECTOR -- A SOMEWHAT DARKER CIRCLE IN A LIGHT
BACKGROUND -- AND A FLEXIBLE NETWORK OF CLEAR PLASTIC SHOT OUT WITH A
FAINT HISS, WRAPPED ITSELF ABOUT HIM, AND BURIED ITS TRIPLE TIP INTO THE
SEAT AT HIS OTHER SIDE. HE FOUND HIMSELF HELD, ELASTICALLY, IN A KIND OF
LACEWORK.

 

  "IF YOU WANT TO FREE YOURSELF, THERE IS THE BELT RELEASE THERE, JUST
BETWEEN YOUR KNEES." KALIININ LEANED FARTHER TOWARD HIM TO INDICATE THE
PLACE AND MORRISON FOUND THE PRESSURE OF HER BODY AGAINST HIS TO BE
PLEASURABLE.

 

  SHE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AWARE OF IT AND, HAVING COMPLETED HER TASK, SHE
PULLED HERSELF BACK INTO HER CHAIR AND RE-BELTED HERSELF.

 

  MORRISON GLANCED QUICKY AROUND, SQUEEZING UPWARD AND FORWARD AS FAR AS
THE BELT WOULD LET HIM, AND PEERED, WITH DIFFICULTY, OVER KONEV'S
SHOULDER. ALL FIVE WERE BELTED.

 

  HE SAID, "WE'VE MINIATURIZED TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE VERY LITTLE
WEIGHT, IS THAT IT?"

 

  "YOU ONLY WEIGH ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE MILLIGRAMS NOW," SAID BORANOVA, "SO
THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONSIDER YOURSELF WEIGHTLESS. THEN, TOO, THE SHIP
IS BEING LIFTED."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AT KALIININ ACCUSINGLY AND KALIININ SHRUGGED SLIGHTLY
AND SAID, "I TOLD YOU I'D DESCRIBE THINGS AS THEY HAPPENED, BUT YOU
SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP AND I THOUGHT IT WISER TO LET YOU STAY THAT WAY. THE
JAR OF THE CLAMP WOKE YOU AND LIFTED YOU OUT OF THE SEAT."

 

  "THE CLAMP?" HE LOOKED TO ONE SIDE. HE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A SHADOW
ON BOTH SIDES, BUT WALLS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE OPAQUE AND HE HAD DISMISSED
THE SENSATION. NOW HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THE SHIP'S WALLS WERE
TRANSPARENT AND REALIZED THAT THE LIGHT ON EITHER SIDE WAS BLOCKED.

 

  KALIININ NODDED. "A CLAMP IS GRIPPING US AND HELPING TO KEEP US STEADY
SO THAT WE ARE NOT SHAKEN UP UNNECESSARILY. IT LOOKS ENORMOUS, BUT IT IS
A VERY SMALL AND DELICATELY PADDED CLAMP. AND WE ARE BEING PUT INTO A
SMALL TANK OF SALINE SOLUTION. WE ARE ALSO BEING HELD STEADY BY AN
AIRSTREAM BEING SUCKED UPWARD INTO A BLUNT NOZZLE. THAT PUSHES US
AGAINST THE NOZZLE SO THAT, WITH THE CLAMPS, WE ARE HELD THREE WAYS."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED OUT AGAIN. OBJECTS OUTSIDE THE SHIP THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN VISIBLE THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE WALL NOT BLOCKED BY THE CLAMP OR BY
THE OVERHEAD NOZZLE WERE, NEVERTHELESS, NOT VISIBLE. MORRISON COULD SEE
OCCASIONAL SHIFTING OF LIGHT AND SHADOW AND REALIZED THAT WHATEVER
EXISTED OUT THERE WAS TOO LARGE TO MAKE OUT CLEARLY WITH HIS TINY EYES.
IF THE PHOTONS THAT APPROACHED THE SHIP WERE NOT THEMSELVES MINIATURIZED
AS THEY ENTERED THE FIELD, THEY WOULD BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE LONG
RADIO WAVES AND HE WOULD HAVE SEEN NOTHING AT ALL.

 

  HE FELT THE SHIP SUDDENLY JAR AGAIN AS THE CLAMPS WITHDREW, ALTHOUGH
HE COULDN'T ACTUALLY SEE THEM WITHDRAW. ONE MOMENT THEY WERE THERE AND
THE NEXT THEY WEREN'T. THE MOVEMENT -- ON HIS SCALE -- WAS TOO RAPID TO
SEE.

 

  THEN HE FELT HIMSELF RISING SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE BELT THAT BOUND HIM
IN AND HE INTERPRETED THAT AS A DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP. THERE
FOLLOWED A SLOW BOBBING SENSATION.

 

  DEZHNEV POINTED TO A DARK HORIZONTAL LINE THAT MOVED SLOWLY UP AND
DOWN AGAINST THE WALL OF THE SHIP AND SAID WITH SATISFACTION, "THAT'S
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. I THOUGHT THE MOTIONS WOULD BE WORSE.
APPARENTLY, THERE ARE ENGINEERS IN THIS PLACE WHO ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS
I AM."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ACTUALLY, ENGINEERING HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH IT. WE'RE
BEING HELD IN PLACE BY SURFACE TENSION. THAT WILL ONLY WORK WHILE WE'RE
AT THE SURFACE OF A FLUID. IT WILL NOT AFFECT US ONCE WE'RE IN
SHAPIROV'S BODY."

 

  "BUT THIS RIPPLE EFFECT, NATASHA? THIS UP-AND-DOWN MOVEMENT. IS THAT
AFFECTING IT AT ALL?"

 

  BORANOVA WAS STUDYING HER INSTRUMENTS AND, IN PARTICULAR, A SMALL
SCREEN ON WHICH A HORIZONTAL LINE SEEMED TO BE PLAYING OUT FOREVER,
WITHOUT BUDGING FROM THE CENTER. MORRISON, TWISTING AND LIFTING UNTIL
HIS BACK ACHED, COULD JUST MAKE IT OUT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IT'S AS STEADY AS YOUR HAND WHEN YOU ARE SOBER,
ARKADY."

 

  "NO BETTER THAN THAT, EH?" DEZHNEV'S LAUGH BOOMED OUT.

 

  (HE SOUNDS RELIEVED, THOUGHT MORRISON UNEASILY AND WONDERED WHAT THE
"IT" WAS THAT DEZHNEV HAD FELT MIGHT BE AFFECTED.)

 

  "WHAT HAPPENS NOW?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  KONEV SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS FAR AS MORRISON COULD REMEMBER,
SINCE MINIATURIZATION HAD BEGUN. "MUST EVERYTHING BE EXPLAINED TO YOU?"

 

  MORRISON ANSWERED WITH SPIRIT. "YES! YOU HAVE HAD EVERYTHING EXPLAINED
TO YOU. WHY SHOULD I NOT HAVE IT EXPLAINED AS WELL?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID QUIETLY, "ALBERT IS PERFECTLY CORRECT, YURI. PLEASE HOLD
YOUR TEMPER AND BE REASONABLE. YOU WILL NEED HIS HELP SOON ENOUGH AND I
HOPE HE WILL NOT BE SO DISCOURTEOUS AS TO SNAP AT YOU."

 

  KONEV'S SHOULDERS TWITCHED, BUT HE SAID NOTHING IN REPLY.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THE CYLINDER OF A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE WILL PICK US UP,
ALBERT. IT WILL BE UNDER REMOTE CONTROL."

 

  AND, AS THOUGH THAT CYLINDER WERE WAITING TO HEAR HER SAY SO, A SHADOW
ENCASED THEM FROM BEHIND, SWALLOWING THEM ALMOST AT ONCE. ONLY IN FRONT
WAS THERE A CIRCLE OF LIGHT VISIBLE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN THAT
DISAPPEARED, TOO.

 

  BORANOVA SAID CALMLY, "THE NEEDLE HAS BEEN CLAMPED ON. NOW WE WILL
HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE."

 

  THE INTERIOR OF THE SHIP, WHICH HAD BECOME QUITE DARK, WAS SUDDENLY
SUFFUSED WITH A WHITE LIGHT, RATHER SOFTER AND MORE RESTFUL THAN BEFORE,
AND BORANOVA SAID, "FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE NO MORE LIGHT FROM THE
OUTSIDE UNTIL OUR JOURNEY IS OVER. WE WILL HAVE TO RELY ON OUR OWN
INTERNAL ILLUMINATION, ALBERT."

 

  PUZZLED, MORRISON LOOKED AROUND FOR THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT. IT SEEMED
TO BE IN THE TRANSPARENT WALLS THEMSELVES.

 

  KALIININ, INTERPRETING HIS GLANCE, SAID, "ELECTROLUMINESCENCE."

 

  "BUT WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF POWER?"

 

  "WE HAVE THREE MICROFUSION ENGINES." SHE LOOKED AT HIM PROUDLY. "OF A
TYPE THAT'S THE BEST IN THE WORLD." THEN SHE REPEATED, "IN THE WORLD."

 

  MORRISON LET IT GO. HE HAD THE IMPULSE TO TALK OF THE AMERICAN
MICROFUSION ENGINES ON THE LATEST SPACE VESSELS, BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE
POINT? SOMEDAY THE WORLD WOULD BE FREED OF ITS NATIONALIST FERVORS, BUT
THAT DAY HAD NOT YET ARRIVED. STILL, AS LONG AS THOSE FERVORS DID NOT
EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN VIOLENCE OR THREAT OF VIOLENCE, MATTERS WERE
BEARABLE.

 

  DEZHNEV, LEANING BACK IN HIS SEAT WITH HIS ARMS BEHIND HIS NECK AND
APPARENTLY ADDRESSING THE GENTLY ILLUMINATED WALL BEFORE HIM, SAID,
"SOMEDAY WHAT WE WILL DO IS EXPAND A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE, PLACE THAT
AROUND A FULL-SIZED SHIP, AND MINIATURIZE THE WHOLE THING. THEN WE WON'T
HAVE THIS SMALL-SCALE MANEUVERING."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "OH, CAN YOU DO THE OTHER THING, TOO? WHAT DO YOU CALL
IT? MAXIMIZATION? GIGANTIZATION?"

 

  "WE DON'T CALL IT ANYTHING," SAID KONEV CRISPLY, "BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE
DONE."

 

  "MAYBE SOMEDAY, THOUGH."

 

  "NO," SAID KONEV. "NEVER. IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. IT TAKES A LOT
OF ENERGY TO MINIATURIZE, BUT MORE THAN AN INFINITE AMOUNT TO MAXIMIZE."

 

  "EVEN IF YOU HOOKED IT UP TO RELATIVITY?"

 

  "EVEN SO."

 

  DEZHNEV MADE AN INELEGANT SOUND WITH HIS LIPS. "THAT FOR YOUR
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. SOMEDAY YOU WILL SEE."

 

  KONEV RELAPSED INTO INDIGNANT SILENCE.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHAT IS IT WE ARE WAITING FOR?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THE LAST-MINUTE PREPARATION OF SHAPIROV AND THEN THE
MOVING UP OF THE NEEDLE AND ITS INSERTION INTO THE CAROTID."

 

  AS SHE SPOKE, THE SHIP WAS JARRED FORWARD.

 

  "IS THAT IT?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  "NOT YET. THEY WERE MERELY REMOVING THE AIR BUBBLES. DON'T WORRY,
ALBERT. WE'LL KNOW."

 

  "HOW?"

 

  "WHY, THEY'LL TELL US. ARKADY IS IN CONTACT WITH THEM. IT'S NOT
DIFFICULT. RADIO WAVE PHOTONS MINIATURIZE AS THEY CROSS THE BOUNDARY
FROM THERE TO HERE AND DEMINIATURIZE AS THEY CROSS IN THE OTHER
DIRECTION. THERE'S VERY LITTLE ENERGY INVOLVED -- EVEN LESS THAN IN THE
CASE OF LIGHT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "IT'S TIME TO MOVE UP TO THE BASE OF THE NEEDLE."

 

  "THEN GO AHEAD," SAID BORANOVA. "WE MIGHT AS WELL TEST THE MOTIVE
POWER UNDER MINIATURIZATION."

 

  THERE WAS A GATHERING RUMBLE THAT REACHED A LOW PEAK AND THEN SETTLED
DOWN INTO A BUZZING MURMUR. MORRISON TWISTED HIS HEAD IN ORDER TO LOOK
AS NEARLY BACKWARD AS HE COULD AGAINST HIS RESTRAINING BELT.

 

  WATER WAS CHURNING BEHIND THEM AS THOUGH PADDLE WHEELS WERE TURNING.
IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL REFERENCE POINT OUTSIDE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
JUDGE HOW QUICKLY THEY WERE MOVING, BUT PROGRESS SEEMED SLOW TO
MORRISON.

 

  "ARE WE MOVING MUCH?" HE ASKED.

 

  "NO, BUT WE DON'T NEED TO," SAID BORANOVA. "THERE'S NO USE WASTING
ENERGY TRYING TO MOVE FASTER. AFTER ALL, WE'RE PUSHING AGAINST
NORMAL-SIZED MOLECULES, WHICH MEANS HIGH VISCOSITY ON OUR SCALE."

 

  "BUT WITH MICROFUSION MOTORS --"

 

  "WE HAVE MANY ENERGY NEEDS FOR MATTERS OTHER THAN PROPULSION."

 

  "I'M JUST WONDERING HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE US TO GET TO KEY POINTS IN
THE BRAIN."

 

  "BELIEVE ME," SAID BORANOVA GRIMLY, "I'M WONDERING, TOO, BUT WE WILL
HAVE AN ARTERIAL CURRENT TAKING US AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE."

 

  DEZHNEV CRIED OUT, "WE'RE THERE! SEE?"

 

  RIGHT AHEAD, IN THE FORWARD LIGHT BEAM OF THE SHIP, A ROUND CIRCLE
COULD BE SEEN. MORRISON HAD NO TROUBLE TRANSLATING THAT INTO THE BASE OF
THE NEEDLE.

 

  ON THE OTHER END OF THAT NEEDLE, THEY WOULD FIND PYOTR SHAPIROV'S
BLOODSTREAM AND THEN THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE WITHIN A HUMAN BODY.

 

  37.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WE'RE TOO LARGE TO GO THROUGH THE NEEDLE, NATALYA."

 

  HE FELT A PECULIAR AMALGAM OF EMOTIONS AT THE THOUGHT. UPPERMOST WAS A
FEELING OF HOPE THAT PERHAPS THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT HAD FAILED. THIS MIGHT
BE AS SMALL AS THEY COULD GET AND IT WASN'T SMALL ENOUGH. THEY WOULD
HAVE TO DEMINIATURIZE AND IT WOULD ALL BE OVER.

 

  UNDER THAT THOUGHT, WELL-HIDDEN, WAS A LITTLE SIGH OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
HAVING COME SO FAR, MIGHT IT NOT BE AS WELL TO GET INTO THE BODY AND
EXPERIENCE THE INTERIOR OF A NERVE CELL? ORDINARILY, BEING NO DARER OF
DANGERS, NO SCALER OF HEIGHTS, MORRISON WOULD HAVE TURNED AWAY IN HORROR
AT THE THOUGHT -- HE DID TURN AWAY IN HORROR -- BUT HAVING MINIATURIZED,
HAVING REACHED THIS POINT, HAVING SURVIVED THE FRIGHT SO FAR, WAS IT
POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT WANT TO GO FARTHER?

 

  BUT ABOVE THESE CONTRADICTORY URGES CAME A BIT OF REALISM. SURELY
THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT SUCH FOOLS AS TO DEAL WITH A SHIP THAT COULD NOT
BE REDUCED TO A SIZE THAT WOULD PASS THROUGH THE NEEDLE IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO PASS THROUGH. NO CONCEIVABLE STUPIDITY IN THESE VERY INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE COULD REACH THAT PITCH.

 

  AND BORANOVA, AS THOUGH SHE WERE RESONATING WITH THAT THOUGHT, SAID,
ALMOST INDIFFERENTLY, "YES, WE ARE TOO LARGE NOW, BUT WE WILL NOT STAY
TOO LARGE. THAT IS MY JOB HERE."

 

  "YOURS?" SAID MORRISON BLANKLY.

 

  "OF COURSE. WE HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THIS POINT BY OUR CENTRAL
MINIATURIZATION DEVICE. NOW THE FINE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE BY ME."

 

  KALIININ MURMURED, "THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE MUST SAVE OUR
MICROFUSION MOTORS FOR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. "DO WE HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY ON
BOARD SHIP FOR FURTHER MINIATURIZATION? SURELY THE IMPRESSION I GOT WAS
THAT A VAST QUANTITY OF ENERGY WAS NEEDED FOR --"

 

  "ALBERT," SAID BORANOVA, "IF GRAVITATION WERE QUANTIZED, THEN IT WOULD
TAKE THE SAME ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO REDUCE A MASS BY HALF,
REGARDLESS OF THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THAT MASS. TO REDUCE THE MASS OF A
MOUSE BY HALF WOULD TAKE THE SAME ENERGY AS WAS REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE
MASS OF AN ELEPHANT BY HALF. BUT THE GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION IS NOT
QUANTIZED AND, THEREFORE, NEITHER IS MASS LOSS. THAT MEANS THAT THE
ENERGY REQUIRED FOR MASS LOSS DECREASES WITH THAT LOSS -- NOT ENTIRELY
IN PROPORTION, BUT TO AN EXTENT. WE HAVE SO LITTLE MASS NOW THAT IT
TAKES MUCH LESS ENERGY TO MINIATURIZE FURTHER."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "BUT SINCE YOU'VE NEVER MINIATURIZED ANYTHING AS LARGE
AS THIS SHIP THROUGH SO MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, YOU ARE DEPENDING ON
THE EXTRAPOLATION OF DATA OBTAINED FOR A MUCH DIFFERENT SIZE RANGE."

 

  (THEY'RE NOT SPEAKING TO AN INFANT, HE THOUGHT INDIGNANTLY. I AM THEIR
EQUAL.)

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA. "WE ARE TAKING THE CHANCE THAT THE EXTRAPOLATION
WILL HOLD, THAT SOMETHING NEW AND UNEXPECTED WILL NOT SURPRISE US.
STILL, WE LIVE IN A UNIVERSE THAT FACES US WITH UNCERTAINTIES NOW AND
THEN. THAT CAN'T BE HELPED."

 

  "BUT WE ALL FACE DEATH IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG."

 

  "DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?" SAID BORANOVA CALMLY. "HAVE YOU BEEN UNEASY
ABOUT THIS FANTASTIC VOYAGE OF OURS SIMPLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF BEING
UNEASY? BUT WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS. IF THINGS GO WRONG AND THE STORED
ENERGY OF MINIATURIZATION IS RELEASED, IT WILL NOT ONLY DESTROY US, BUT
IT MAY DAMAGE THE GROTTO TO SOME EXTENT. I'M SURE THAT MANY AN
UNMINIATURIZED PERSON OUT THERE IS HOLDING HIS OR HER BREATH AND
WONDERING IF HE OR SHE WILL SURVIVE AN EXPLOSION. YOU SEE, ALBERT, EVEN
THOSE WHO ARE NOT UNDERGOING THE RISKS OF MINIATURIZATION ARE NOT
ALTOGETHER SAFE."

 

  DEZHNEV TURNED AND GRINNED WIDELY. MORRISON NOTED THAT ONE OF HIS
UPPER MOLARS WAS CAPPED AND DID NOT MATCH THE RATHER YELLOWISH TINT OF
HIS OTHER TEETH.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "CONCENTRATE ON THE THOUGHT, MY FRIEND, THAT IF
SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, 'SINCE
WE ALL MUST DIE, WHAT BETTER CAN WE ASK FOR THAN A QUICK AND SUDDEN
DEATH?'"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "JULIUS CAESAR SAID THE SAME THING."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "YES, BUT WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO SAY, 'ET TU,
BRUTE.'"

 

  "THERE WILL BE NO DEATH," SAID KONEV SHARPLY, "AND IT IS FOOLISH TO
SPEAK OF IT. THE EQUATIONS ARE CORRECT."

 

  "AH," SAID DEZHNEV. "THERE WAS A TIME OF SUPERSTITION WHEN PEOPLE
RELIED ON THE PROTECTION OF GOD. THANK EQUATIONS WE NOW HAVE EQUATIONS
TO RELY ON."

 

  "NOT FUNNY," SAID KONEV.

 

  "I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE FUNNY, YURI. -- NATASHA, THEY'RE READY OUT THERE
FOR US TO PROCEED."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THEN THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER NEED TO SPECULATE. HERE
WE GO."

 

  MORRISON GRIPPED HIS SEAT TIGHTLY, PREPARING HIMSELF, BUT HE FELT
NOTHING HAPPEN. UP FRONT, THOUGH, THE ROUND CIRCLE HE HAD MADE OUT
EXPANDED AND GREW DIMMER AND DIMMER AS IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY BACKWARD
UNTIL IT COULD NO LONGER BE MADE OUT.

 

  "ARE WE MOVING?" HE ASKED AUTOMATICALLY. IT WAS THE KIND OF QUESTION
ONE WAS UNABLE TO REFRAIN FROM ASKING, EVEN THOUGH THE ANSWER WAS
OBVIOUS.

 

  "YES," SAID KALIININ, "AND WE ARE EXPENDING NO ENERGY IN DOING SO. WE
ARE NOT BATTLING THE WATER MOLECULES. WE ARE BEING CARRIED ALONG BY THE
WATER FLOW IN THE NEEDLE AS THE CYLINDER PRESSES IN SLOWLY."

 

  MORRISON WAS COUNTING TO HIMSELF. IT KEPT HIS MIND MORE EFFICIENTLY
OCCUPIED THAN STUDYING THE SECOND HAND OF HIS WATCH WOULD HAVE DONE.

 

  WHEN HE REACHED A HUNDRED, HE SAID, "HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?"

 

  "HOW LONG WILL WHAT TAKE?" ASKED KALIININ.

 

  "WHEN DO WE REACH THE BLOODSTREAM?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "A FEW MINUTES. THEY ARE GOING VERY SLOWLY, JUST IN CASE
THERE IS SOME KIND OF MICROTURBULENCE. AS MY FATHER ONCE SAID, 'IT IS
SLOWER, BUT BETTER, TO CREEP ALONG THE DOWNWARD PATH THAN TO LEAP OVER
THE CLIFF.'"

 

  MORRISON GRUNTED, THEN SAID, "ARE WE STILL MINIATURIZING?"

 

  BORANOVA ANSWERED FROM BEHIND HIM. "NO. WE ARE DOWN IN THE CELLULAR
RANGE AND THAT IS FAR ENOUGH FOR OUR NEEDS NOW."

 

  MORRISON WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT HE WAS TREMBLING. AFTER ALL, SO
MUCH WAS HAPPENING AND SO MANY NEW THINGS EXISTED TO THINK ABOUT THAT HE
HAD SOMEHOW LACKED THE ROOM TO REMAIN IN TERROR. HE WAS NOT TERRIFIED,
AT LEAST NOT TO AN ACUTE STAGE -- YET FOR SOME REASON HE CONTINUED TO
TREMBLE.

 

  HE ATTEMPTED TO WILL HIMSELF TO RELAX. HE TRIED TO LET HIMSELF DROOP,
BUT THAT REQUIRED MORE THAN AN EFFORT OF WILL. IT NEEDED GRAVITATIONAL
PULL AND THERE WAS NONE TO SPEAK OF. HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SLOWED HIS
BREATHING. HE EVEN TRIED HUMMING, UNDER HIS BREATH, THE CHORAL SINGING
FROM BEETHOVEN'S NINTH SYMPHONY.

 

  FINALLY HE FELT HIMSELF FORCED INTO COMMENT ON THE MATTER. "I'M
SORRY," HE SAID. "I SEEM TO BE SHAKING."

 

  DEZHNEV SNICKERED. "AHA! I WONDERED WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST TO MENTION
IT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IT'S NOT YOU, ALBERT. WE ARE ALL SHAKING SLIGHTLY.
IT'S THE SHIP."

 

  MORRISON WAS AT ONCE ELEVATED INTO FRIGHT. "IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH
IT?"

 

  "NO. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SIZE. IT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO FEEL THE EFFECT
OF BROWNIAN MOTION. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DON'T YOU?"

 

  IT WAS A PURELY RHETORICAL QUESTION. BORANOVA WOULD SURELY EXPECT A
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OF PHYSICS TO KNOW WHAT BROWNIAN MOTION WAS, LET
ALONE MORRISON, AND YET MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF EXPLAINING IT IN HIS OWN
MIND -- NOT IN WORDS, BUT AS A FLASH OF CONCEPT.

 

  EVERY OBJECT SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID IS BOMBARDED ON ALL SIDES BY THE
ATOMS OR MOLECULES OF THE LIQUID. THESE PARTICLES STRIKE RANDOMLY AND
THEREFORE UNEVENLY, BUT THE UNEVENNESS IS SO SMALL COMPARED TO THE TOTAL
THAT IT IS UNNOTICEABLE AND HAS NO MEASURABLE EFFECT. AS AN OBJECT GROWS
SMALLER, HOWEVER, THE UNEVENNESS BECOMES GREATER AMONG THE SMALLER AND
SMALLER NUMBER OF PARTICLES STRIKING THE OBJECT IN A GIVEN TIME. THE
SHIP WAS SMALL ENOUGH NOW TO RESPOND TO THE SLIGHT EXCESSES OF
COILLISIONS -- FIRST IN ONE DIRECTION, THEN IN ANOTHER -- RANDOMLY. IT
MOVED SLIGHTLY IN CONSEQUENCE, A RANDOM TREMBLING.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YES, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. IT WILL GET WORSE
IF WE CONTINUE TO BECOME SMALLER."

 

  "ACTUALLY, IT WON'T," SAID BORANOVA. "THERE WILL BE OTHER
COUNTERACTING EFFECTS."

 

  "I DON'T KNOW OF ANY," SAID MORRISON, FROWNING.

 

  "NEVERTHELESS, THERE WILL BE SUCH EFFECTS."

 

  "LEAVE IT TO THE EQUATIONS," SAID DEZHNEV IN AN AFFECTEDLY PIOUS TONE.
"THE EQUATIONS KNOW."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I THINK THIS COULD MAKE US SEASICK."

 

  "IT CERTAINLY WOULD," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT THERE IS A CHEMICAL
TREATMENT FOR THAT. WE HAVE BEEN DOSED WITH THE SAME CHEMICAL THAT
COSMONAUTS USE AGAINST SPACE SICKNESS."

 

  "NOT I," SAID MORRISON INDIGNANTLY. "NOT ONLY HAVEN'T I BEEN TREATED,
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN FOREWARNED."

 

  "WE TOLD YOU AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE OF THE DISCOMFORTS AND DANGERS OUT
OF CONCERN FOR YOUR COMFORT, ALBERT. AS FOR TREATMENT, YOU CONSUMED YOUR
DOSE WITH YOUR BREAKFAST. -- HOW DO YOU FEEL?"

 

  MORRISON, WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEEL A BIT SQUEAMISH WITH ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT SICKNESS, DECIDED THAT HE FELT FINE. ASTONISHING, HE THOUGHT, THE
TYRANNY EXERTED OVER THE BODY BY THE MIND.

 

  HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE, "TOLERABLE."

 

  "GOOD," SAID BORANOVA, "BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV'S
BLOODSTREAM."

 

  38.

 

  MORRISON STARED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT WALL OF THE SHIP.

 

  BLOOD?

 

  HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO EXPECT REDNESS. WHAT ELSE?

 

  HE PEERED OUT, SQUINTING HIS EYES SLIGHTLY, BUT COULD SEE NOTHING,
EVEN IN THE GLEAMING LIGHT OF THE SHIP. HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN IN A
ROWBOAT, DRIFTING DOWN THE CALM SURFACE OF A POND ON A DARK AND CLOUDY
NIGHT.

 

  MORRISON'S THOUGHTS SUDDENLY VEERED. IN THE ABSOLUTE SENSE, THE LIGHT
WITHIN THE SHIP HAD THE WAVELENGTH OF GAMMA RAYS -- AND VERY HARD GAMMA
RAYS AT THAT. YET THE WAVELENGTHS WERE THE RESULT OF MINIATURIZING
ORDINARY VISIBLE LIGHT AND TO THE EQUALLY MINIATURIZED RETINAS AND OPTIC
LOBES OF THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE SHIP THEY WERE STILL LIGHT RAYS AND HAD
THE PROPERTY OF LIGHT RAYS.

 

  OUTSIDE, JUST BEYOND THE HULL OF THE SHIP, WHERE THE MINIATURIZATION
FIELD ENDED, THE MINIATURIZED PHOTONS ENLARGED TO ORDINARY LIGHT-WAVE
PHOTONS AND THOSE THAT WERE REFLECTED BACK TO THE SHIP WERE MINIATURIZED
AGAIN WHEN THE FIELD BOUNDARY WAS CROSSED. THE OTHERS MIGHT BE
ACCUSTOMED TO THIS PARADOX-RIDDEN SITUATION, BUT TO MORRISON THE ATTEMPT
TO GRASP THE EFFECT OF A MINIATURIZED BUBBLE WITHIN A SEA OF NORMALITY
WAS DIZZYING. WAS THE BOUNDARY VISIBLE, MARKING OFF THE MINIATURIZED
FROM THE NORMAL? WAS THERE A DISCONTINUITY SOMEWHERE?

 

  FOLLOWING HIS LINE OF THOUGHT, HE WHISPERED TO KALIININ, WHO WAS BENT
OVER HER INSTRUMENT, "SOPHIA, WHEN OUR LIGHT LEAVES THE MINIATURIZATION
FIELD AND EXPANDS, IT MUST GIVE OFF HEAT ENERGY, AND WHEN IT'S REFLECTED
BACK INTO THE SHIP IT MUST ABSORB ENERGY IN ORDER TO BE MINIATURIZED AND
THE ENERGY MUST COME FROM US. AM I RIGHT?"

 

  "PERFECTLY, ALBERT," SAID KALIININ WITHOUT LOOKING UP. "OUR USE OF
LIGHT RESULTS IN A SMALL BUT STEADY LOSS OF ENERGY, BUT OUR MOTORS CAN
SUPPLY THAT. IT IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN."

 

  "AND ARE WE REALLY IN THE BLOODSTREAM?"

 

  "NEVER FEAR. WE ARE. NATALYA WILL PROBABLY DIM THE INTERNAL LIGHTS IN
A WHILE AND YOU'LL SEE THE OUTSIDE MORE CLEARLY THEN."

 

  ALMOST AS THOUGH THAT WERE A SIGNAL, BORANOVA SAID, "THERE! NOW WE CAN
RELAX FOR A FEW MOMENTS." THE LIGHTS DIMMED.

 

  AT ONCE, OBJECTS OUTSIDE THE SHIP CAME DIMLY INTO VIEW. HE COULD NOT
MAKE THEM OUT CLEARLY YET, BUT THEY WERE IMMERSED IN SOMETHING
HETEROGENEOUS, SOMETHING WITH OBJECTS FLOATING IN IT, AS WOULD BE TRUE
OF BLOOD.

 

  MORRISON STIRRED UNEASILY, STRAINING AT THE CONSTRAINT OF HIS SEAT
BELT. HE SAID, "BUT IF WE ARE IN THE BLOODSTREAM, WHICH IS AT A
TEMPERATURE OF THIRTY-SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS, WE'LL --"

 

  "OUR TEMPERATURE IS CONDITIONED. WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE," SAID
KALIININ. "REALLY, ALBERT, WE'VE THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS."

 

  "PERHAPS YOU HAVE," SAID MORRISON, SLIGHTLY OFFENDED, "BUT I HAVEN'T
BEEN PRIVY TO THOSE THOUGHTS, HAVE I? HOW CAN YOU CONDITION THE
TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A COLD SINK?"

 

  "WE DON'T HAVE ONE HERE, BUT THERE'S OUTER SPACE, ISN'T THERE? THE
MICROFUSION MOTORS GIVE OFF A THIN DRIZZLE OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES WHICH,
UNDER MINIATURIZED CONDITIONS, HAVE A MASS OF VERY NEARLY ZERO. THEY
THEREFORE TRAVEL AT VIRTUALLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT, PENETRATING MATTER AS
EASILY AS NEUTRINOS DO AND CARRYING OFF ENERGY WITH THEM. IN LESS THAN A
SECOND THEY ARE IN OUTER SPACE, SO THAT THE EFFECT IS OF TRANSFERRING
HEAT FROM WITHIN THE SHIP INTO OUTER SPACE AND WE KEEP COOL. DO YOU
SEE?"

 

  "I SEE," MUTTERED MORRISON. IT WAS INGENIOUS -- BUT PERHAPS OBVIOUS,
AFTER ALL, TO THOSE USED TO THINKING IN TERMS OF MINIATURIZATION.

 

  MORRISON NOTICED THAT THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIP, IMMEDIATELY UNDER
DEZHNEV'S HANDS, WERE LUMINOUS, AS WERE THE INSTRUMENTS BEFORE KALIININ.
HE STRUGGLED TO RAISE HIMSELF IN HIS SEAT AND MANAGED TO SEE A CORNER OF
THE COMPUTER SCREEN IN FRONT OF KONEV. IT CONTAINED WHAT MORRISON
THOUGHT MIGHT BE A MAP OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE NECK. FOR A
MOMENT, BEFORE HIS BODY CEASED ITS FIGHT AGAINST THE WEBBING OF THE BELT
AND HE SANK DOWN INTO HIS SEAT AGAIN, HE SAW A SMALL RED DOT ON THE
SCREEN, WHICH, HE DEDUCED, WAS A DEVICE TO MARK THE POSITION OF THE SHIP
IN THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY.

 

  HE WAS PANTING A LITTLE FROM HIS EFFORT AND HAD TO WAIT A FEW MOMENTS
TO REGAIN CONTROL OF HIS BREATH. THE RECESS IN WHICH HIS OWN COMPUTER
RESTED WAS ILLUMINATED AND HE SHIELDED THAT BIT OF LIGHT FROM HIS FACE
BY RAISING HIS LEFT HAND. THEN HE LOOKED OUT.

 

  FAR IN THE DISTANCE, MORRISON COULD SEE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A
WALL, A BARRIER OF SOME SORT. IT RECEDED, THEN APPROACHED, THEN RECEDED
AGAIN, OVER AND OVER, RHYTHMICALLY. AUTOMATICALLY, HE LOOKED AT HIS
WATCH FOR A FEW SECONDS. IT WAS CLEARLY THE PULSATION OF THE ARTERIAL
WALL.

 

  HE SAID TO KALIININ IN A LOW VOICE, "OBVIOUSLY THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS
NOT AFFECTED BY MINIATURIZATION. AT LEAST THE PULSATION OF THE HEART IS
-- JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE, EVEN THOUGH I VIEW IT WITH MINIATURIZED
EYES AND TIME IT WITH A MINIATURIZED WATCH."

 

  IT WAS KONEV WHO ANSWERED. "TIME ISN'T QUANTIZED APPARENTLY, OR AT
LEAST IT ISN'T AFFECTED OY THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD, WHICH MAY BE THE
SAME THING. THAT'S CONVENIENT. IF WE HAD TO TAKE A SHIFTING TIME FLOW
INTO ACCOUNT, THINGS MIGHT BECOME UNBEARABLY COMPLICATED."

 

  MORRISON SILENTLY AGREED AND TURNED HIS THOUGHTS IN OTHER DIRECTIONS.

 

  IF THEY WERE INSIDE AN ARTERY, AND IF THE SHIP WERE MERELY BEING SWEPT
FORWARD BY THE CURRENT, THE FORWARD MOVEMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SPURTS,
ONE SPURT FOR EACH CONTRACTION OF THE DISTANT HEART (THE VERY DISTANT
HEART -- ON THE SCALE OF THEIR PRESENT SIZE). AND IF THAT WERE SO, HE
OUGHT TO FEEL THOSE SPURTS OF MOTION.

 

  HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED TO HOLD AS STILL AS POSSIBLE, TO MOVE NOT
AT ALL EXCEPT FOR THE TREMBLING OF THE BROWNIAN MOTION -- WHICH, AFTER
ALL, HE COULD IN NO WAY CONTROL.

 

  AH, HE COULD FEEL IT. A SLIGHT BUT DISTINCT PUSH BACKWARD AS THE SPURT
STARTED, A SLIGHT PUSH FORWARD AS IT CAME TO AN END.

 

  BUT WHY WAS THE SPURT NOT MORE ENERGETIC? WHY WAS HE NOT YANKED
BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN A SICKENING FASHION?

 

  AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE MASS HE NO LONGER POSSESSED. WITH HIS
REMAINING MASS SO TINY, HIS INERTIA WAS SIMILARLY TINY. THE VISCOSITY OF
THE NORMAL FLUID OF THE BLOODSTREAM EXERTED AN ENORMOUS CUSHIONING
EFFECT, SO THAT THE SPURTS WERE ALL BUT LOST IN THE BROWNIAN MOTION.

 

  AND, EVER SO SLIGHTLY, MORRISON FELT HIMSELF RELAX. HE FELT SOMETHING
INSIDE HIMSELF UNTIGHTEN A BIT. THE MINIATURIZED ENVIRONMENT WAS
UNEXPECTEDLY BENIGN.

 

  HE LOOKED THROUGH THE SHIP'S TRANSPARENT HULL AGAIN, HIS EYES FOCUSING
ON THE VOLUME BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE ARTERIAL WALL. HE COULD SEE
BUBBLES, FAINTLY OUTLINED. NO, NOT BUBBLES, BUT THINGS OF SUBSTANCE --
MANY OF THEM. SOME TURNED SLOWLY AND CHANGED APPARENT SHAPE AS THEY DID
SO, SO THEY WERE NOT SPHERES. THEY WERE DISKS, HE NOW REALIZED.

 

  THE TRUTH BURST IN ON HIM AND SHAMED HIM. WHY WAS HE SO SLOW IN
IDENTIFYING THEM, SINCE HE KNEW HE WAS IN A BLOODSTREAM? -- BUT THEN HE
KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT, TOO. HE COULD NOT REALLY CONCEIVE OF HIMSELF AS
BEING IN A BLOODSTREAM; IT WAS TOO EASY TO SUPPOSE HE WAS IN A SUBMARINE
MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH AN OCEAN. HE WOULD NATURALLY EXPECT TO SEE THE
FAMILIAR SIGHTS OF AN OCEAN AND WOULD BE FOOLISHLY PUZZLED AT ANYTHING
HE SAW THAT DID NOT FIT HIS ASSUMPTION.

 

  HE WOULD SEE THE RED CORPUSCLES OF THE BLOOD -- THE ERYTHROCYTES --
AND FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THEM.

 

  OF COURSE, THEY WEREN'T RED BUT FAINTLY YELLOWISH. EACH ONE ABSORBED
SOME SHORTWAVE LIGHT TO PRODUCE THAT COLOR. GET THEM IN BULK, THOUGH,
MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF THEM, AND THEY WOULD ABSORB ENOUGH SUCH LIGHT
TO APPEAR RED -- IN ARTERIAL BLOOD, ANYWAY, AND THEY WERE IN AN ARTERY
NOW. ONCE THE CELLS WITHDREW THE OXYGEN CARRIED BY THE RED CORPUSCLES,
THE INDIVIDUAL CORPUSCLE WOULD SEEM FAINTLY BLUISH, AND, IN BULK,
BLUE-PURPLE.

 

  HE WATCHED THE ERYTHROCYTES WITH INTEREST AND SAW THEM QUITE CLEARLY
NOW THAT HE HAD RECOGNIZED THEM FOR WHAT THEY WERE.

 

  THEY WERE BICONCAVE DISCS, THE CENTERS DEPRESSED ON EACH SIDE. TO
MORRISON, THEY WERE ENORMOUS, CONSIDERING THAT, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS,
THEY WERE MICROSCOPIC, PERHAPS SEVEN AND A HALF MICROMETERS IN DIAMETER
AND A LITTLE OVER TWO MICROMETERS THICK. NOW HERE THEY WERE, SWOLLEN
OBJECTS THE SIZE OF HIS HAND.

 

  THERE WERE MANY OF THEM IN SIGHT AND THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO PILE
TOGETHER IN ROULETTES. THESE WEREN'T STATIC, HOWEVER. SOME CORPUSCLES
WOULD PEEL OFF THE ROULETTES AND OTHERS WOULD ADD ON AND THERE WERE
ALWAYS SOME SINGLE CORPUSCLES IN VIEW. THOSE THAT WERE IN SIGHT TENDED
TO STAY IN SIGHT; THEY WEREN'T MOVING RELATIVE TO THE SHIP.

 

  "I TAKE IT," SAID MORRISON, "THAT WE'RE SIMPLY GOING WITH THE FLOW."

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT," SAID KALIININ. "IT SAVES ENERGY."

 

  BUT, AT THAT, THE RED CORPUSCLES WEREN'T ENTIRELY STATIONARY RELATIVE
TO THE SHIP. MORRISON NOTICED ONE CORPUSCLE DRIFTING SLOWLY TOWARD THE
SHIP, CARRIED PERHAPS BY A BIT OF MICROTURBULENCE OR BY A RANDOM PUSH OF
BROWNIAN MOTION. THE CORPUSCLE FLATTENED SLIGHTLY AND MOMENTARILY
AGAINST THE PLASTIC OF THE SHIP AND THEN REBOUNDED.

 

  MORRISON TURNED TO KALIININ. "DID YOU SEE THAT, SOPHIA?"

 

  "THE RED CORPUSCLE NUDGING US? YES."

 

  "WHY DIDN'T IT MINIATURIZE? SURELY IT ENTERED THE FIELD."

 

  "NOT QUITE, ALBERT. IT BOUNCED OFF THE FIELD, WHICH EXTENDS A SMALL
DISTANCE BEYOND ANY MINIATURIZED OBJECT, SUCH AS OUR SHIP, IN EVERY
DIRECTION. THERE'S A CERTAIN REPULSION BETWEEN NORMAL MATTER AND
MINIATURIZED MATTER, AND THE GREATER THE EXTENT OF MINIATURIZATION, THE
STRONGER THE REPULSION. THAT'S WHY VERY TINY OBJECTS SUCH AS
MINIATURIZED ATOMS OR SUBATOMIC PARTICLES GO THROUGH MATTER WITHOUT
INTERACTING WITH IT. IT'S ALSO THAT WHICH KEEPS THE MINIATURIZED STATE
METASTABLE."

 

  "HOW DO YOU MEAN?"

 

  "ANY MINIATURIZED OBJECT IS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY NORMAL MATTER, UNLESS
IT IS IN DEEP SPACE. IF NOTHING SERVED TO KEEP NORMAL MATTER OUT OF THE
FIELD, SUCH MATTER WOULD FOREVER BE MINIATURIZING AND, IN THE PROCESS,
ABSORBING ENERGY FROM THE MINIATURIZED OBJECT. THE DRAIN WOULD BE
SIGNIFICANT AND THE MINIATURIZED OBJECT WOULD QUICKLY DEMINIATURIZE. IN
FACT, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INDUCE MINIATURIZATION IN THE FIRST
PLACE, SINCE THE ENERGY CRAMMED INTO THE MINIATURIZING OBJECT WOULD LEAK
AWAY AT ONCE. WHAT WE WOULD THEN BE TRYING TO DO, IN EFFECT, WOULD BE TO
MINIATURIZE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. -- OF COURSE, THE REPULSION ISN'T
EXTREMELY STRONG AT OUR SIZE. IF A RED CORPUSCLE COLLIDED WITH
SUFFICIENT FORCE, THE COLLIDING SURFACE MIGHT UNDERGO SOME
MINIATURIZATION."

 

  MORRISON TURNED BACK TO THE VIEW AND, ALMOST AT ONCE, SOMETHING THAT
WAS OBVIOUSLY A SHREDDED RED CORPUSCLE DRIFTED INTO VIEW.

 

  "AH," SAID MORRISON, "IS THAT AN EXAMPLE OF ONE THAT APPROACHED US TOO
FORCEFULLY?"

 

  KALIININ BENT TOWARD MORRISON TO GET A BETTER VIEW IN THE DIRECTION HE
WAS POINTING. SHE SHOOK HER HEAD. "I DON'T THINK SO, ALBERT. RED
CORPUSCLES HAVE A LIMITED LIFE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. THE
POOR THINGS WEAR OUT AND BREAK DOWN. IN THE VOLUME OF BLOOD WE CAN SEE,
SEVERAL DOZEN WOULD BREAK DOWN EVERY MINUTE, SO THAT TORN AND DAMAGED
RED CORPUSCLES WOULD BE A COMMON SIGHT. -- AND THAT IS A GOOD THING,
TOO, FOR IT MEANS THAT IF WE WERE TO USE OUR POWER AND RUSH THROUGH THE
BLOODSTREAM, BREAKING UP A FEW RED CORPUSCLES, OR EVEN A FEW MILLION, IT
WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SHAPIROV. WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BREAK DOWN
RED CORPUSCLES AT A RATE EVEN APPROACHING THAT OF NATURAL BREAKDOWN."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHAT ABOUT PLATELETS?"

 

  "WHY DO YOU ASK?"

 

  "THAT MUST BE A PLATELET I SEE THERE." HE POINTED. "IT'S LENTIL-SHAPED
AND ONLY HALF THE SIZE OF THE RED CORPUSCLES."

 

  A PAUSE AND THEN KALIININ NODDED. "AH YES, I SEE IT NOW. THAT'S A
PLATELET. THERE SHOULD BE ONE OF THEM TO EVERY TWENTY RED CORPUSCLES."

 

  THAT WAS ABOUT RIGHT, MORRISON THOUGHT. IF HE WERE ON A CAROUSEL,
REACHING OUT FOR RINGS AS HE PASSED, AND REACH RED CORPUSCLE WERE AN
ORDINARY IRON RING, THE OCCASIONAL PLATELET WOULD REPRESENT THE COVETED
BRASS RING.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "MY POINT, SOPHIA, IS THAT PLATELETS ARE MORE FRAGILE
THAN RED CORPUSCLES AND WHEN THEY BREAK THEY START THE CLOTTING PROCESS.
IF WE BREAK A FEW, WE'LL START A CLOT FORMING IN THE ARTERY. SHAPIROV
WILL THEN HAVE ANOTHER STROKE AND SURELY DIE."

 

  BORANOVA, WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN MORRISON AND
KALIININ, INTERPOSED AT THIS POINT. "IN THE FIRST PLACE," SHE SAID,
"PLATELETS ARE NOT AS FRAGILE AS ALL THAT. THEY CAN STRIKE US LIGHTLY
AND REBOUND WITHOUT HARM. THE DANGER OF ANOTHER STROKE LIES AT THE
ARTERIAL WALL. THE PLATELETS ARE MOVING MUCH FASTER RELATIVE TO THE
INNER WALL OF THE CAROTID ARTERY THAN THEY ARE RELATIVE TO US. AND THE
INNER WALL OF THE ARTERY MAY BE LAYERED WITH CHOLESTEROL AND LIPID
PLAQUES OF ALL KINDS. THAT SURFACE IS THEREFORE MUCH ROUGHER AND UNEVEN
THAN THE SMOOTH PLASTIC HULL OF OUR SHIP. IT'S AT THE ARTERIAL WALL THAT
THE CLOTS MIGHT FORM -- NOT HERE. AND EVEN THAT ISN'T TOO ENORMOUS A
DANGER. A SINGLE PLATELET -- OR EVEN A FEW HUNDRED OF THEM -- MIGHT BE
BROKEN AND STILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO START THE CLOTTING PROCESS IN A WAY
THAT DOESN'T DAMP OUT. MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF PLATELETS MUST BREAK TO
TURN THE TRICK."

 

  MORRISON WATCHED A PLATELET THAT VANISHED, NOW AND THEN, BEHIND THE
NUMEROUS RED CORPUSCLES. HE WANTED TO SEE IF IT WOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH
THE SHIP AND, IF IT DID, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THE PLATELET, HOWEVER, DID
NOT OBLIGE BUT REMAINED AT A DISTANCE.

 

  IT THEN OCCURRED TO MORRISON THAT THE PLATELET APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE
AS HIS HAND. HOW COULD THAT BE IF THEY WERE HALF THE DIAMETER OF THE RED
CORPUSCLES AND THE RED CORPUSCLES WERE THEMSELVES AS LARGE AS HIS HAND?
HIS EYES SOUGHT OUT A RED CALL AND, SURE ENOUGH, IT SEEMED CONSIDERABLY
LARGER THAN HIS HAND.

 

  HE SAID, TROUBLED, "THE OBJECTS OUT THERE ARE GETTING LARGER."

 

  "WE'RE STILL MINIATURIZING, OBVIOUSLY," CALLED OUT KONEV, APPARENTLY
ANNOYED AT MORRISON'S SEEMING INABILITY TO DRAW THE PROPER CONCLUSION
FROM AN OBSERVED FACT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THAT'S RIGHT, ALBERT. THE CORONARY IS NARROWING AS WE
PROGRESS AND WE WANT TO KEEP PACE WITH IT."

 

  "WE DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN THE PIPE," SAID DEZHNEV GENIALLY, "BY
BEING TOO FAT." THEN, AS ANOTHER THOUGHT STRUCK HIM, HE ADDED, "YOU
KNOW, NATASHA, I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS THIN IN MY LIFE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, UNMOVED, "YOU ARE AS FAT AS EVER, ARKADY, ON THE SCALE
OF PLANCK'S CONSTANT."

 

  MORRISON WAS IN NO MOOD FOR AIRY BANTER. "BUT HOW FAR DO WE
MINIATURIZE, NATALYA?"

 

  "DOWN TO MOLECULAR SIZE, ALBERT."

 

  AND ALL OF MORRISON'S APPREHENSIONS SURGED UP AGAIN.

 

  39.

 

  MORRISON FELT FOOLISH AT HIS FAILURE TO REALIZE AT ONCE THAT THEY WERE
STILL MINIATURIZING AND, AT THE SAME TIME, BITTERLY RESENTFUL AT KONEV
FOR MAKING IT PLAIN HE RECOGNIZED THAT FOLLY. THE TROUBLE WAS THAT ALL
THESE OTHERS HAD BEEN LIVING AND THINKING MINIATURIZATION FOR YEARS AND
HE HIMSELF, A NEWCOMER TO THE CONCEPT, WAS STILL TRYING TO CRAM IT INTO
HIS RELUCTANT BRAIN. COULDN'T THEY SYMPATHIZE WITH HIS DIFFICULTIES?

 

  HE STUDIED THE RED CORPUSCLES MOODILY. THEY WERE DISTINCTLY LARGER.
THEY WERE WIDER ACROSS THAN HIS CHEST AND THEIR BOUNDARIES WERE BECOMING
LESS SHARP. THEIR SURFACES QUIVERED, AS THOUGH THEY WERE CANVAS BAGS
FULL OF SYRUP.

 

  HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO KALIININ, "MOLECULAR SIZE?"

 

  KALIININ LOOKED QUICKLY AT HIM, THEN TURNED AWAY AND SAID, "YES."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT SHOULD BOTHER ME, CONSIDERING
THE SMALL SIZE TO WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY MINIATURIZED, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING RATHER FRIGHTENING ABOUT BEING AS SMALL AS A MOLECULE. HOW
SMALL A MOLECULE, DO YOU SUPPOSE?"

 

  KALIININ SHRUGGED. "I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S UP TO NATALYA. A VIRUS
MOLECULE, PERHAPS."

 

  "BUT THIS SORT OF THING HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED."

 

  KALIININ SHOOK HER HEAD. "WE'RE CHARTING UNKNOWN TERRITORY."

 

  THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THEN MORRISON SAID UNEASILY, "AREN'T YOU
AFRAID?"

 

  SHE LOOKED AT HIM FURIOUSLY, BUT CONTINUED TO WHISPER. "OF COURSE I'M
AFRAID. WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM? IT ISN'T SENSIBLE NOT TO BE AFRAID WHEN
YOU HAVE RATIONAL REASON FOR IT. I WAS AFRAID WHEN I WAS VIOLATED. I WAS
AFRAID WHEN I WAS PREGNANT AND DESERTED. I'VE SPENT HALF MY LIFE BEING
AFRAID. EVERYONE DOES. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DRINK AS MUCH AS THEY DO, TO
WIPE OUT THE FEAR THAT GRIPS THEM." SHE WAS VIRTUALLY HISSING THROUGH
CLENCHED TEETH. "DO YOU WANT ME TO BE SORRY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID?"

 

  "NO," MUTTERED MORRISON, TAKEN ABACK.

 

  "THERE'S NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT BEING AFRAID," SHE WENT ON, "AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T ACT AFRAID -- AS LONG AS YOU DON'T LET YOURSELF BE TWISTED
INTO DOING NOTHING BECAUSE OF FEAR, INTO HAVING HYSTERICS BECAUSE OF
FEAR, INTO FAILING --" SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF IN A BITTER, WHISPERED
SELF-ACCUSATION. "I'VE HAD HYSTERICS IN MY TIME." HER GLANCE FLICKERED
IN THE DIRECTION OF KONEV, WHOSE BACK WAS STRAIGHT, STIFF, AND
MOTIONLESS.

 

  "BUT NOW," SHE WENT ON, "I INTEND TO DO MY PART, EVEN IF I AM
HALF-DEAD WITH FEAR. NO ONE WILL TELL FROM MY ACTIONS THAT I'M AFRAID.
AND THAT HAD BETTER BE YOUR CASE, TOO, MR. AMERICAN."

 

  MORRISON SWALLOWED HARD AND HE SAID, "YES, OF COURSE," BUT IT SOUNDED
VERY UNCONVINCING, EVEN TO HIM.

 

  HIS EYES FLICKED BACKWARD, THEN FORWARD. THERE WAS NO USE WHISPERING
IN THOSE CLOSE QUARTERS. THERE WAS NO WHISPER SO LOW IT WOULD NOT BE
OVERHEARD.

 

  BORANOVA, BEHIND KALIININ, WAS OBVIOUSLY BUSY WITH HER MINIATURIZATION
MECHANISM, BUT THERE WAS A TINY SMILE ON HER FACE. APPROVAL? CONTEMPT?
MORRISON COULDN'T TELL.

 

  AS FOR DEZHNEV, HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND CALLED OUT, "NATASHA, IT IS
CONTINUING TO NARROW. SHOULD YOU HASTEN THE MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "I'LL DO WHAT IS NEEDED, ARKADY."

 

  DEZHNEV'S EYE CAUGHT MORRISON'S AND HE WINKED, WITH A GRIN. "DON'T
BELIEVE LITTLE SOPHIA," HE SAID, PRETENDING TO WHISPER. "SHE IS NOT
AFRAID. NEVER AFRAID. SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT YOU TO BE ALONE WITH YOUR
UNEASINESS. SHE HAS A VERY SOFT HEART, OUR SOPHIA, AS SOFT AS HER --"

 

  "KEEP QUIET, ARKADY," SAID SOPHIA. "SURELY YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE TOLD
YOU THAT IT IS NOT WISE TO BEAT THE EMPTY TEAPOT YOU CALL YOUR HEAD WITH
THE RUSTY SPOON YOU CALL YOUR TONGUE."

 

  "AH," SAID DEZHNEV, ROLLING HIS EYES, "THAT WAS HARSH. WHAT MY FATHER
DID SAY WAS THAT NO KNIFE COULD BE HONED AS SHARP AS A WOMAN'S TONGUE.
-- BUT, ALBERT, SERIOUSLY, REACHING MOLECULAR SIZE IS NOTHING. WAIT
UNTIL WE HAVE LEARNED TO ATTACH RELATIVITY TO QUANTUM THEORY AND THEN,
WITH A TINY PUFF OF ENERGY, WE WILL REDUCE OURSELVES TO SUBATOMIC SIZE.
THEN YOU WILL SEE."

 

  "WHAT WILL I SEE?" SAID MORRISON.

 

  "YOU WOULD SEE INSTANT ACCELERATION. WE WOULD SIMPLY TAKE OFF --" HE
REMOVED HIS HANDS FROM THE CONTROLS MOMENTARILY IN ORDER TO MAKE A
WHIZZING GESTURE WITH THEM, ACCOMPANIED BY A SHRILL WHISTLE.

 

  BORANOVA SAID CALMLY, "HANDS ON THE CONTROLS, ARKADY."

 

  "OF COURSE, MY DEAR NATASHA," SAID DEZHNEV, "A MOMENT OF EXCUSABLE
DRAMA, NO MORE." THEN TO MORRISON, "INSTANTLY WE WOULD GO AT NEARLY THE
SPEED OF LIGHT, THE MUCH FASTER SPEED OF LIGHT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS. IN
TEN MINUTES WE COULD BE ACROSS THE GALAXY, IN THREE HOURS AT THE
ANDROMEDA, IN TWO YEARS AT THE NEAREST QUASAR. AND IF THAT'S NOT FAST
ENOUGH, WE CAN GET SMALLER STILL. WE HAVE FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL, WE
HAVE ANTIGRAVITY, WE HAVE EVERYTHING. THE SOVIET UNION WILL LEAD THE WAY
TO IT ALL."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "AND HOW WOULD YOU GUIDE THE FLIGHT, ARKADY?"

 

  "WHAT?"

 

  "HOW WOULD YOU GUIDE IT?" SAID MORRISON SERIOUSLY. "AS SOON AS THE
SHIP SWOOPS DOWN TO THE PROPER SIZELESSNESS AND MASSLESSNESS, IT WILL,
IN EFFECT, RADIATE OUTWARD AT HUNDREDS OF LIGHT-YEARS PER SECOND. THAT
MEANS THAT IF THERE WERE TRILLIONS OF SHIPS, THEY WOULD SHOOT OUT IN
EVERY DIRECTION WITH SPHERICAL SYMMETRY -- LIKE SUNLIGHT. BUT SINCE
THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE SHIP, IT WOULD MOVE OUTWARD IN ONE PARTICULAR
DIRECTION, BUT IN AN ABSOLUTELY UNPREDICTABLE ONE."

 

  "THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE CLEVER THEORETICIANS -- LIKE YURI."

 

  KONEV HAD NOT INDICATED ANY INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION UP TO THAT
POINT, BUT NOW HE SNORTED LOUDLY.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S WISE TO DEVELOP THE TRAVELING
AND CARELESSLY ASSUME THE STEERING. WOULDN'T YOUR FATHER SAY: 'A WISE
MAN DOES NOT BUILD THE ROOF OF A HOUSE FIRST.'"

 

  "HE MIGHT," SAID ARKADY, "BUT WHAT HE ONCE DID SAY WAS THIS: 'IF YOU
FIND A GOLD KEY WITHOUT A LOCK, DON'T THROW IT AWAY. THE GOLD IS ALSO
SUFFICIENT.'"

 

  BORANOVA STIRRED IN HER SEAT BEHIND MORRISON AND SAID, "ENOUGH WITH
THE SAWS AND SAYINGS, MY FRIENDS. -- WHERE ARE WE, YURI? ARE WE MAKING
PROGRESS?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "IN MY OPINION WE ARE, BUT I WOULD LIKE THE AMERICAN TO
SUPPORT MY JUDGMENT, OR CORRECT IT."

 

  "HOW CAN I DO EITHER?" SNAPPED MORRISON. "I'M STRAPPED IN."

 

  "THEN UNSTRAP," SAID KONEV. "IF YOU FLOAT A BIT, AT LEAST YOU CAN'T
FLOAT VERY FAR."

 

  FOR A MOMENT, MORRISON FUMBLED AT HIS SEAT BELT, HAVING FORGOTTEN THE
LOCATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CONTACT. KALIININ'S HAND MOVED QUICKLY AND
HE WAS FREE.

 

  "THANK YOU, SOPHIA," HE SAID.

 

  "YOU WILL LEARN," SHE REPLIED INDIFFERENTLY.

 

  "LIFT YOURSELF SO THAT YOU CAN SEE OVER MY SHOULDER," SAID KONEV.

 

  MORRISON DID SO AND, INEVITABLY, PUSHED TOO HARD AGAINST THE BACK OF
THE SEAT AHEAD. AS A RESULT OF HIS INSIGNIFICANT INERTIA, HE MOVED
UPWARD EXPLOSIVELY AND STRUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE SHIP. HAD
THIS HAPPENED AT THE SAME SPEED UNDER UNMINIATURIZED CONDITIONS, HE
MIGHT WELL HAVE SUFFERED THE BLINDING PAIN OF A CONCUSSION, BUT THE VERY
LACK OF MASS AND INERTIA THAT HAD SENT HIM SHOOTING UPWARD HAD BOUNCED
HIM BACK ALMOST ONCE WITH NO SENSATION OF PAIN AND VIRTUALLY NONE OF
PRESSURE. HE WAS AS EASY TO STOP AS HE HAD BEEN TO START.

 

  KONEV CLICKED HIS TONGUE. "GENTLY. JUST LIFT YOUR HAND UPWARD
EDGEWISE, TURN IT SLOWLY, THEN PUSH IT DOWN FLATWISE, SLOWLY. DO YOU GET
IT?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I UNDERSTAND."

 

  HE FOLLOWED KONEV'S SUGGESTION AND MOVED UP SLOWLY. HE CAUGHT AT
KONEV'S SHOULDER AND STOPPED HIMSELF.

 

  KONEV SAID, "NOW, LOOK HERE AT THE CEREBROGRAPH. DO YOU SEE WHERE WE
ARE AT THIS MOMENT?"

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING AT AN ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX NETWORK, WITH
A DISTINCT THREE-DIMENSIONAL EFFECT. IT CONSISTED OF SINUOUS RILLS
BRANCHING OUTWARD IN SUCH A WAY AS TO FORM AN EXCEEDINGLY INTRICATE
TREE. IN ONE OF THE LARGER BRANCHES THERE WAS A SMALL RED DOT, MOVING
SLOWLY AND PROGRESSIVELY.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "CAN YOU GIVE ME A BROADER VIEW SO THAT I CAN PLACE
THIS SECTION?"

 

  KONEV, WITH ANOTHER CLICK OF HIS TONGUE, ONE THAT MIGHT HAVE SIGNIFIED
IMPATIENCE, EXPANDED THE VIEW. "DOES THIS HELP?"

 

  "YES, WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF THE BRAIN." HE COULD RECOGNIZE THE
INDIVIDUAL CONVOLUTIONS AND FISSURES. "WHERE DO YOU PLAN TO GO?"

 

  THE PICTURE MAGNIFIED SOMEWHAT. KONEV SAID, "WE'LL CURVE OFF HERE INTO
THE INTERIOR OF THE NEURONIC LAYER -- THE GRAY MATTER. AND WHERE I'D
LIKE TO HEAD FOR, BY THIS ROUTE" -- HE NAMED THE AREAS IN RUSSIAN
RAPIDLY AND MORRISON STRUGGLED TO TRANSLATE THEM IN HIS MIND INTO
ENGLISH -- "IS THIS AREA HERE WHICH, IF I HAVE READ YOUR PAPERS
CORRECTLY, IS A CRUCIAL NODE OF THE NEURONIC NETWORK."

 

  "NO TWO BRAINS ARE EXACTLY ALIKE," SAID MORRISON. "I CAN PIN DOWN
NOTHING WITH CERTAINTY, ALL THE MORE SO IF THE PARTICULAR BRAIN IN
QUESTION IS ONE I HAVE NEVER STUDIED. STILL, I WOULD SAY THE AREA YOU'RE
HEADING FOR LOOKS HOPEFUL."

 

  "GOOD, AS FAR AS THAT GOES. AND IF WE GET TO MY DESTINATION, WILL YOU
BE ABLE TO TELL MORE ACCURATELY WHETHER WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS WHERE
SEVERAL BRANCHES OF THE NETWORK MEET OR, IF NOT, IN WHAT DIRECTION AND
HOW FAR SUCH A CROSSROADS MIGHT BE?"

 

  "I CAN TRY," SAID MORRISON CAUTIOUSLY, "BUT PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I
HAVE MADE NO GUARANTEES AS TO MY ABILITIES IN THIS CONNECTION. I HAVE
NOT OFFERED YOU ANY PROMISES. I HAVE NOT VOLUNTEERED --"

 

  "WE KNOW THAT, ALBERT," SAID BORANOVA. "WE ASK ONLY THAT YOU DO WHAT
YOU CAN."

 

  "IN ANY CASE," SAID KONEV, "THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING AS A FIRST
APPROXIMATION AND WE'LL GET THERE BEFORE LONG, EVEN THOUGH THE CURRENT
IS SLOWING. WE ARE, AFTER ALL, ALMOST DOWN TO CAPILLARY SIZE. -- STRAP
YOURSELF IN, ALBERT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I NEED YOU."

 

  MORRISON MANAGED TO OPERATE THE SEAT BELT WITHOUT ANY HELP, PROVING
THAT EVEN SMALL TRIUMPHS CAN BE SWEET.

 

  ALMOST TO CAPILLARY SIZE, HE THOUGHT, AND LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE WALLS
OF THE SHIP.

 

  THE VESSEL WALL WAS STILL AT A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE, BUT IT HAD
CHANGED IN APPEARANCE. EARLIER, THE STEADILY PULSATING WALLS HAD BEEN
RATHER FEATURELESS. NOW, HOWEVER, MORRISON COULD MAKE OUT NO PULSING AND
THE WALLS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK FAINTLY TILED. THE TILING, MORRISON
REALIZED, CONSISTED OF THE CELLS THAT MADE UP THE THINNING WALLS.

 

  HE COULD NOT ACTUALLY GET A CLEAR LOOK AT THE TILING, EITHER, FOR THE
RED CORPUSCLES WERE IN THE WAY. THEY WERE NOW SOFT BAGS NEARLY THE SIZE
OF THE SHIP. OCCASIONALLY, ONE BALLOONED PAST THE SHIP AT CLOSE QUARTERS
AND WAS PUSHED ELASTICALLY INWARD AT THE POINT OF CONTACT, WITHOUT
UNDERGOING ANY VISIBLE HARM.

 

  ONE TIME A SMALL SMEAR WAS LEFT BEHIND. PERHAPS THE CONTACT HAD BEEN
JUST A LITTLE TOO FORCEFUL AND A LINE OF MINIATURIZED MOLECULES HAD BEEN
FORMED AGAINST THE HULL, MORRISON THOUGHT. THE SMEAR LIFTED OFF QUICKLY,
HOWEVER, AND DISSOLVED IN THE SURROUNDING FLUID.

 

  THE PLATELETS WERE ANOTHER STORY, SINCE BY THEIR VERY NATURE THEY WERE
MUCH MORE FRAGILE THAN THE RED CORPUSCLES.

 

  ONE MADE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH THE SHIP. OR PERHAPS IT HAD BEEN
SLOWED BY A COLLISION WITH A RED CORPUSCLE SO THAT THE SHIP HAD
OVERTAKEN IT. THE PROW OF THE SHIP PENETRATED DEEPLY AND THE SKIN OF THE
PLATELET PUNCTURED. ITS CONTENTS OOZED OUT SLOWLY, MIXING WITH THE
PLASMA AND THEN FORMING INTO TWO OR THREE LONG STRINGS THAT TANGLED WITH
EACH OTHER. THEY CLUNG TO A PORTION OF THE SHIP'S HULL FOR QUITE A TIME,
TRAILING BEHIND.

 

  MORRISON WAITED TO SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF A CLOT FORMING. NONE DID.

 

  MINUTES LATER MORRISON SAW, UP AHEAD, A MILKY FOG THAT SEEMED TO FILL
THE BLOOD VESSEL FROM WALL TO WALL, PULSATING AND UNDULATING. INSIDE IT
WERE DARK GRANULES THAT MOVED STEADILY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. TO
MORRISON, IT LOOKED LIKE A MALIGNANT MONSTER AND HE COULDN'T HELP BUT
CRY ALOUD IN A MOMENT OF TERROR.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 10 -- CAPILLARY

 

  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER WATER IS BOILING, DON'T TEST IT BY HAND.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  40.

 

  DEZHNEV TURNED HIS HEAD, STARTLED, AND SAID, "IT'S A WHITE CELL,
ALBERT, A LEUCOCYTE. IT IS NOTHING TO BE BOTHERED ABOUT."

 

  MORRISON SWALLOWED AND FELT DISTINCTLY ANNOYED. "I KNOW IT'S A WHITE
CELL. IT JUST CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE. IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE."

 

  "IT'S NOTHING," SAID DEZHNEV. "A PIECE OF PUMPERNICKEL, REALLY, AND NO
BIGGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. WE'RE JUST SMALLER. AND EVEN IF IT WERE AS BIG
AS MOSCOW, SO WHAT? IT'S JUST FLOATING ALONG IN THE BLOODSTREAM AS WE
ARE."

 

  "AS A MATTER OF FACT," SAID KALIININ GENTLY, "IT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WE'RE HERE -- I MEAN, THAT WE'RE ANYTHING SPECIAL. IT THINKS WE'RE A RED
CORPUSCLE."

 

  KONEV SEEMED TO BE ADDRESSING THE AIR IN FRONT OF HIM IN AN ABSTRACTED
SORT OF WAY, SAYING, "WHITE CELLS DO NOT THINK."

 

  A FLASH OF RESENTMENT CROSSED KALIININ'S FACE, FLUSHING IT SLIGHTLY,
BUT HER VOICE REMAINED EVEN. "BY SAYING 'THINK,' ALBERT, I AM MERELY
USING A FIGURE OF SPEECH. WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THE WHITE CELL'S BEHAVIOR
TOWARD US IS THAT WHICH IT WOULD DISPLAY TOWARD A RED CORPUSCLE."

 

  MORRISON CAST ANOTHER LOOK TOWARD THE LARGE BILLOWING CELL UP AHEAD
AND DECIDED THAT, HARMLESS OR NOT, HE FOUND ITS APPEARANCE DISTASTEFUL.
HE LOOKED WITH MUCH APPRECIATION AT THE CONTRAST MADE BY KALIININ'S
PRETTY HIGH-CHEEKBONED FACE, AND WONDERED WHY SHE HAD NEVER HAD THAT
LITTLE MOLE UNDER THE LEFT CORNER OF HER LIP REMOVED. THEN HE WONDERED
IF IT DIDN'T ADD JUST THE RIGHT TRIFLE OF PIQUANCY TO A FACE THAT MIGHT
OTHERWISE BE CONSIDERED TOO PRETTY TO POSSESS CHARACTER.

 

  THAT MOMENT OF BESIDE-THE-POINT SPECULATION EFFECTIVELY REMOVED THE
UNEASINESS THAT THE WHITE CELL'S APPEARANCE HAD INTRODUCED AND MORRISON
RETURNED, IN HIS MIND, TO KALIININ'S STATEMENT.

 

  "DOES IT ACT AS THOUGH WE'RE A RED CORPUSCLE BECAUSE WE'RE THE RIGHT
SIZE FOR IT?"

 

  "THAT MAY HELP," SAID KALIININ, "BUT IT'S NOT THE REAL REASON. YOU
JUDGE A RED CORPUSCLE TO BE A RED CORPUSCLE BECAUSE YOU SEE IT. THE
WHITE CELL JUDGES A RED CORPUSCLE TO BE ONE BECAUSE IT SENSES THE
CHARACTERISTIC PATTERN OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERN ON ITS SURFACE.
WHITE CELLS ARE TRAINED -- THAT IS JUST ANOTHER FIGURE OF SPEECH -- LET
US SAY, ADAPTED -- TO IGNORE THAT."

 

  "BUT THIS SHIP DOESN'T HAVE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PATTERN OF A RED
CORPUSCLE ... AH, BUT I GUESS YOU'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT."

 

  KALIININ SMILED IN GENTLE SELF-SATISFACTION. "YES, I HAVE. IT IS MY
SPECIALITY."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "THAT IS IT, ALBERT. OUR LITTLE SOPHIA KNOWS, COMPLETELY
IN HER HEAD" -- HE TAPPED HIS RIGHT TEMPLE -- "THE EXACT ELECTROMAGNETIC
PATTERN OF EVERY CELL, EVERY BACTERIUM, EVERY VIRUS, EVERY PROTEIN
MOLECULE, EVERY --"

 

  "NOT QUITE," SAID KALIININ, "BUT THOSE I FORGET, MY COMPUTER CAN
SUPPLY. AND I HAVE A DEVICE HERE THAT CAN USE THE ENERGY OF THE
MICROFUSION MOTORS TO PLACE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ELECTRIC CHARGES ON
THE SHIP IN WHATEVER PATTERN I CHOOSE. THE SHIP HAS THE CHARGE PATTERN
OF A RED CORPUSCLE ON ITSELF AS BEST AS I CAN DUPLICATE IT, AND THAT IS
CLOSE ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE WHITE CELL TO REACT -- OR, RATHER, NOT TO
REACT -- ACCORDINGLY."

 

  "WHEN DID YOU DO THAT, SOPHIA?" ASKED MORRISON WITH INTEREST.

 

  "WHEN WE WERE REDUCED TO THE SIZE THAT WOULD MAKE US A POTENTIAL
OBJECT OF INTEREST FOR A WHITE CELL OR FOR THE IMMUNE APPARATUS
GENERALLY. WE DON'T WANT ANTIBODIES SWARMING OVER US, EITHER."

 

  A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO MORRISON. "SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING
REDUCED IN SIZE, WHY HASN'T THE BROWNIAN MOTION GOTTEN WORSE? I SHOULD
THINK IT WOULD BATTER US MORE AS WE GOT SMALLER."

 

  BORANOVA PUT IN FROM BEHIND, "SO IT WOULD IF WE WERE UNMINIATURIZED
OBJECTS OF THIS SIZE. SINCE WE ARE MINIATURIZED, THERE ARE THEORETICAL
REASONS THAT PREVENT BROWNIAN MOTION FROM GETTING VERY BAD. IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT."

 

  MORRISON THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THEN SHRUGGED. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TELL
HIM ANYTHING THEY THOUGHT MIGHT MAKE HIM TOO KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE MATTER
OF MINIATURIZATION AND WHAT DID THAT MATTER? THE BROWNIAN MOTION HAD NOT
GROWN WORSE. IN FACT, IT HAD GROWN LESS TROUBLESOME (OR WAS HE JUST
GETTING USED TO IT?) AND HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO THAT. THAT MADE IT, AS
BORANOVA SAID, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

 

  HIS ATTENTION SHIFTED BACK TOWARD KABININ. "HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
TRAINING IN THIS FIELD, SOPHIA?"

 

  "SINCE MY GRADUATE DAYS. EVEN WITHOUT SHAPIROV'S COMA, WE ALL KNEW THE
TIME WOULD COME WHEN A TRIP THROUGH A BLOODSTREAM WOULD BECOME
NECESSARY. WE'VE BEEN PLANNING SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND
WE KNEW THAT THIS SKILL OF MINE WOULD BE NEEDED."

 

  "YOU MIGHT HAVE PLANNED AN AUTOMATED CREWLESS SHIP."

 

  "SOMEDAY, PERHAPS," SAID BORANOVA, "WE WILL, BUT NOT YET. WE CANNOT,
EVEN NOW, MAKE THE AUTOMATION EQUIVALENT TO THE VERSATILITY AND
INGENUITY OF A HUMAN BRAIN."

 

  "THAT'S TRUE," SAID KALIININ. "AN AUTOMATED PATTERN MAKER WOULD PLACE
US IN THE RED CORPUSCLE PATTERN AS A WAY OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF LEAST
RESISTANCE, AND IT WOULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. AFTER ALL, IT WOULD
BE A USELESS EXPENSE AND PERHAPS AN IMPRACTICAL EXERCISE ALTOGETHER TO
TRY TO INSTIL IN AN AUTOMATED PATTERN MAKER THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
APPROPRIATELY IN RESPONSE TO ALL SORTS OF IMPROBABLE CONDITIONS. WHEN I
AM PRESENT, HOWEVER, I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING. I CAN
CHANGE THE PATTERN TO MEET AN UNLIKELY EMERGENCY, TO TEST THE VALUE OF
SOMETHING EARLIER UNTHOUGHT OF, OR SIMPLY TO SUIT A WHIM. -- FOR
INSTANCE, I COULD CHANGE THE SHIP'S PATTERN TO THAT OF AN E COLI
BACTERIUM AND THE WHITE CELL WOULD ATTACK AT ONCE."

 

  "I'M SURE OF THAT," SAID MORRISON, "BUT DON'T DO IT, PLEASE."

 

  "NO FEAR," SAID KALIININ. "I WON'T."

 

  BUT BORANOVA'S VOICE SOUNDED IN SUDDEN -- AND UNCHARACTERISTIC --
EXCITEMENT. "ON THE CONTRARY, SOPHIA, DO THAT!"

 

  "BUT, NATALYA --"

 

  "I MEAN IT, SOPHIA. DO IT. WE HAVEN'T TESTED YOUR INSTRUMENT UNDER
FIELD CONDITIONS, YOU KNOW. LET'S TRY IT."

 

  KONEV MUTTERED, "THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME, NATALYA. LET US FIRST GET TO
WHERE WE'RE GOING."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IT WON'T DO US ANY GOOD TO GET THERE -- IF WE CAN'T
ENTER A CELL. HERE IS AN IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY AT HAND TO SEE IF SOPHIA
CAN CONTROL THE BEHAVIOR OF A CELL."

 

  "I AGREE," SAID DEZHNEV BOISTEROUSLY. "THIS HAS BEEN A REMARKABLY
UNEVENTFUL TRIP SO FAR."

 

  "THAT'S THE BEST KIND, I SHOULD THINK," SAID MORRISON.

 

  BUT DEZHNEV HELD UP A DISAPPROVING HAND. "MY OLD FATHER USED TO SAY:
'TO WANT PEACE AND QUIET ABOVE ALL ELSE IS TO HOPE FOR DEATH.'"

 

  "GO AHEAD, SOPHIA," BORANOVA SAID FIRMLY. "WE WASTE TIME."

 

  KALIININ HESITATED A BARE MOMENT -- THE TIME REQUIRED, PERHAPS, TO
REMEMBER THAT BORANOVA WAS CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP -- THEN HER HAND
FLICKERED OVER THE CONTROLS OF HER DEVICE AND THE CONFIGURATIONS UPON
THE TELEVISION SCREEN ALTERED MARKEDLY. (MORRISON ADMIRED, IN AN
APPREHENSIVE SORT OF WAY, THE SPEED WITH WHICH SHE DID IT.)

 

  MORRISON LIFTED HIS EYES TO THE WHITE CELL AHEAD, AND FOR A MOMENT HE
SAW NO CHANGE. AND THEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH A FIT OF TREMBLING OVERTOOK
THE MONSTER AND DEZHNEV WHISPERED, "AHA, IT RECOGNIZES THE PRESENCE OF
ITS PREY."

 

  AT THE EXTREME FORWARD END OF THE WHITE CELL, ITS SUBSTANCE SEEMED TO
BULGE TOWARD AND ALL AROUND THEM IN AN UNEVEN CIRCLE. AT THE SAME TIME,
THE SUBSTANCE IN THE CENTER RETREATED AS THOUGH IT WERE BEING SUCKED IN.
MORRISON ENVISIONED A MONSTER'S JAWS PREPARING FOR A MEAL.

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT WORKS, NATALYA. THAT CREATURE AHEAD IS PREPARING TO
ENVELOP AND ENGULF US."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "SO IT IS. VERY WELL, SOPHIA, RESTORE US TO THE RED
CELL MODE."

 

  AGAIN KALIININ'S FINGERS FLICKERED AND THE CONFIGURATIONS ON THE
SCREEN RETURNED (AS NEARLY AS MORRISON'S MEMORY COULD JUDGE) TO WHAT
THEY HAD EARLIER BEEN.

 

  THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THE WHITE CELL REMAINED UNAFFECTED. ITS OUTER RIM
WAS SHOOTING PAST THE SHIP, WHICH WAS NOW HEADING INTO THE DEEP CENTRAL
CONCAVITY.

 

  41.

 

  MORRISON WAS APPALLED. THE ENTIRE SHIP WAS ENCASED BY SOMETHING THAT
LOOKED PRECISELY LIKE FOG -- A GRITTY GRANULAR FOG, WITHIN WHICH A
MULTILOBED OBJECT, FAINTLY DENSER THAN THE REST, WRITHED ITS WAY AROUND
THEM. MORRISON KNEW THAT THIS MUST BE THE NUCLEUS OF THE WHITE CELL.

 

  KONEV SNAPPED OUT ANGRILY, "APPARENTLY, ONCE THE WHITE CELL GEARS
ITSELF FOR ENGULFMENT, THE REST IS AUTOMATIC AND NOTHING WILL STOP IT.
-- WHAT NOW, NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA REPLIED QUIETLY, "I ADMIT I HADN'T EXPECTED THIS. THE FAULT
IS MINE."

 

  "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?" SAID DEZHNEV, FROWNING. "IT'S NO MATTER. WHAT
CAN THIS BLOB DO TO US? IT CANNOT CRUSH US. IT IS NOT A BOA
CONSTRICTOR."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT CAN TRY TO DIGEST US. WE'RE IN A FOOD VACUOLE RIGHT
NOW AND DIGESTIVE ENZYMES ARE POURING IN AROUND US."

 

  "LET THEM POUR," SAID DEZHNEV. "I WISH THEM THE JOY OF THE ATTEMPT.
THE SHIP'S WALL IS NOT DIGESTIBLE TO ANYTHING A WHITE CELL HAS. AFTER A
WHILE, IT WILL REJECT US AS INDIGESTIBLE RESIDUE."

 

  "HOW WILL IT KNOW?" ASKED KALIININ.

 

  "HOW WILL IT KNOW WHAT?" SNAPPED DEZHNEV.

 

  "HOW WILL IT KNOW WE ARE INDIGESTIBLE RESIDUE? IT WAS SPURRED INTO
ACTIVITY BY OUR BACTERIAL CHARGE PATTERN."

 

  "WHICH YOU REMOVED."

 

  "YES, BUT AS SOMEONE REMARKED, THE WHITE CELL, ONCE STIMULATED,
APPARENTLY HAS TO GO THROUGH ITS WHOLE CYCLE OF ACTIVITY. IT IS NOT A
THINKING DEVICE; IT IS ENTIRELY AUTOMATIC." KALIININ WAS FROWNING NOW
AND LOOKING AROUND AT THE OTHERS. "IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WHITE CELL
WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO DIGEST US UNTIL IT IS GIVEN THE APPROPRIATE
STIMULUS THAT WILL PUT ITS ENGULFMENT MECHANISM INTO REVERSE AND ALLOW
IT TO EJECT US."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "BUT WE NOW HAVE THE CHARGE PATTERN OF A RED CORPUSCLE
AGAIN. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD STIMULATE REJECTION? IT DOESN'T EAT
RED CELLS."

 

  "I THINK IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT," SAID KALIININ A LITTLE DIFFIDENTLY,
AS THOUGH NERVOUS ABOUT STANDING UP TO BORANOVA. "THE RED CORPUSCLE
PATTERN KEEPS IT UNENGULFED, BUT ONCE IT IS ENGULFED BY SOME MEANS, IT
WOULD SEEM THAT THE PATTERN ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SPARK EJECTION.
AFTER ALL, HERE WE ARE; WE ARE NOT BEING EJECTED."

 

  HER EYES -- ALL FIVE PAIRS OF EYES, IN FACT -- UNEASILY SURVEYED THE
WALL OF THE SHIP. THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THE CLOUDY CELL.

 

  "I THINK," KALIININ WENT ON, "THAT THERE'S A CHARGE PATTERN TO THE
KIND OF INDIGESTIBLE RESIDUE LEFT BY THE BACTERIA THE WHITE CELL IS
DESIGNED TO ENGULF AND THAT THAT ALONE WOULD BE A TRIGGER FOR EJECTION."

 

  "IN THAT CASE," SAID DEZHNEV, "GIVE IT THE PATTERN IT WANTS, SOPHIA,
MY LITTLE CHICKEN."

 

  "GLADLY," SAID KALIININ, "IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT IT IS BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T JUST TRY PATTERNS AT RANDOM. THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE
PATTERNS IS ASTRONOMICAL."

 

  "AS A MATTER OF FACT," SAID KONEV, "CAN WE BE SURE THE WHITE CELL
EJECTS ANYTHING AT ALL? PERHAPS INDIGESTIBLE RESIDUE BECOMES PART OF ITS
GRANULAR MATERIAL AND REMAINS WITHIN IT UNTIL IT IS REMOVED AND
DISMANTLED IN THE SPLEEN."

 

  BORANOVA SAID SHARPLY (PERHAPS WEIGHED DOWN WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PRESENT SITUATION, THOUGHT MORRISON),
"THERE IS NO POINT IN BABBLING. IS THERE A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "I CAN TURN ON THE MICROFUSION MOTORS AND BORE A WAY OUT
OF THE WHITE CELL."

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA SHARPLY. "DO YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION WHICH WE ARE
HEADING AT THIS MOMENT? INSIDE THIS FOOD VACUOLE WE MAY BE SLOWLY
TURNING OR THE VACUOLE ITSELF MAY BE DRIFTING THROUGH THE CELL'S
SUBSTANCE. IF YOU SMASH YOUR WAY OUTWARD, YOU MAY DAMAGE THE WALL OF THE
BLOOD VESSEL AND THE BRAIN ITSELF."

 

  KONEV SAID, "FOR THAT MATTER, WHITE CELLS CAN WIGGLE OUT OF A
CAPILLARY, WORKING THEIR WAY BETWEEN THE CELLS THAT MAKE UP THE
CAPILLARY WALL. SINCE THE PATH WE HAVE TAKEN HAS LED US INTO AN
ARTERIOLE BRANCH THAT HAS NARROWED TO JUST ABOUT CAPILLARY SIZE, WE
CAN'T EVEN BE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL IN THE BLOODSTREAM."

 

  "YES, WE CAN," SAID MORRISON SUDDENLY. "THE WHITE CELL CAN PINCH
ITSELF SMALL, BUT IT CAN'T PINCH US SMALL. IF IT SQUEEZES OUT OF THE
VESSEL, IT WOULD BE FORCED TO LEAVE US BEHIND. -- AND THAT WOULD BE A
GOOD THING, EXCEPT THAT IT HASN'T DONE IT."

 

  "THERE YOU ARE," SAID DEZHNEV. "I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT SOONER.
NATASHA, MAKE US BIGGER AND CRACK THE WHITE CELL OPEN. GIVE IT
INDIGESTION LIKE IT HAS NEVER HAD."

 

  AGAIN A SHARP NEGATIVE FROM BORANOVA. "AND CRACK THE BLOOD VESSEL
OPEN, TOO? THE BLOOD VESSEL IS FAIRLY SMALL NOW, NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THE
WHITE CELL."

 

  KALIININ SAID, "IF ARKADY WILL GET IN TOUCH WITH THE GROTTO, SOMEONE
THERE MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA."

 

  THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN BORANOVA SAID IN A
HALF-STRANGLED WAY, "NOT JUST YET. WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOOLISH --
WELL, I HAVE -- AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR
ALL OF US IF WE DIDN'T NEED HELP."

 

  "WE CAN'T WAIT FOREVER," SAID KONEV RESTLESSLY. "THE FACT IS THAT I
DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE BY NOW. I CAN'T RELY ON THE WHITE CELL DRIFTING
WITH THE BLOODSTREAM OR WITH MAINTAINING ANY GIVEN SPEED, FOR THAT
MATTER. ONCE WE ARE LOST, IT MAY TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME TO LOCATE
OURSELVES AND WE MAY NEED HELP FROM THE GROTTO TO DO IT, TOO. IN THAT
CASE, HOW DO WE EXPLAIN BEING LOST?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "HOW ABOUT THE AIR-CONDITIONING?"

 

  THERE WAS A PAUSE AND BORANOVA SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALBERT?"

 

  "WELL, WE'RE SENDING MINIATURIZED SUBATOMIC PARTICLES OUT OF THE SHIP
AND INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE. THEY CARRY HEAT AWAY FROM THE SHIP, I WAS
TOLD, SO THAT WE REMAIN COOL EVEN IN THE ALL-PERVASIVE WARMTH OF THE
BODY WE'RE IN. THAT COOLNESS MUST BE SOMETHING THE WHITE CELL IS NOT
DESIGNED TO TOLERATE. IF WE TURN UP THE AIR-CONDITIONING AND BECOME
COLDER STILL, THERE MAY COME A TIME WHEN THE WHITE CELL WILL BE
UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO EJECT US."

 

  BORANOVA MULLED THIS OVER AND SAID EVENLY, "I THINK -- POSSIBLY --
THAT MIGHT WORK."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "DON'T BOTHER THINKING. I'VE TURNED UP THE
AIR-CONDITIONING TO MAXIMUM. LET'S SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS BESIDES ALL
OF US GETTING FROSTBITE."

 

  MORRISON WATCHED THE FOG OUTSIDE. HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS AS
TENSE AS THE OTHERS. HE WAS NOT IN AGONY OVER AN UNFORTUNATE DECISION --
AN ILL-ADVISED EXPERIMENT. NOR WAS HE BITING HIS NAILS OVER THE FATE OF
SHAPIROV AND YET -- TAPPING HIS OWN EMOTIONS, IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT
HAVING COME THUS FAR, HAVING BEEN MINIATURIZED AND FINDING HIMSELF IN A
SMALL CEREBRAL ARTERIOLE, HE SUDDENLY HAD AN URGE TO CHECK OUT HIS
THEORIES. HAD HE COME THIS FAR IN ORDER TO TURN BACK AND SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE, HOLDING UP AN IMAGINARY THUMB AND FOREFINGER NEARLY IN
CONTACT AND SAYING IN THE DEPTH OF HIS MIND, "MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH"?

 

  VERY WELL, THEN. HE HAD PASSED FROM DESPERATELY NOT WANTING TO ATTEMPT
THE PROJECT TO A DEFINITE RELUCTANCE TO ABORT IT.

 

  DEZHNEV'S VOICE BROKE IN ON HIS THOUGHTS. "I DON'T THINK THIS LITTLE
ANIMAL LIKES WHAT'S HAPPENING."

 

  MORRISON WAS CONSCIOUS OF A BITING CHILL, AND SHIVERED AS HE BECAME
AWARE THAT THE THIN COTTON UNIFORM HE WORE WAS A TOTALLY INADEQUATE
SHIELD AGAINST THIS SUDDEN ONSET OF WINTER.

 

  AND PERHAPS THE WHITE CELL "THOUGHT" THIS, TOO, FOR THE FOG THINNED
AND A RIFT APPEARED IN IT. THEN, IN ANOTHER MOMENT OR TWO, THE
SURROUNDINGS WERE CLEAR AND THE WHITE CELL WAS A BALL OF FOG TO THEIR
REAR, DRIFTING AWAY -- OR PERHAPS CRAWLING AWAY -- AMOEBALIKE, FROM AN
UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

 

  BORANOVA SAID (SOUNDING A LITTLE DUMBFOUNDED), "WELL, IT'S GONE."

 

  DEZHNEV WAVED BOTH HANDS HIGH IN THE AIR. "A TOAST -- IF WE HAD A
SMALL SWALLOW OF VODKA WITH US -- TO OUR AMERICAN HERO. IT WAS AN
EXCELLENT SUGGESTION."

 

  KALIININ NODDED AT MORRISON AND SMILED. "IT WAS A GOOD IDEA."

 

  "AS GOOD AS MINE WAS BAD," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT
YOUR TECHNIQUE CAN DO WHAT IT SHOULD, SOPHIA -- AS LONG AS WE KNOW
ENOUGH. AND AS FOR YOU, ARKADY, EASE THE AIR-CONDITIONING INTENSITY
BEFORE WE ALL CATCH PNEUMONIA. -- SO YOU SEE, ALBERT, WE HAVE ALREADY
DONE WELL TO TAKE YOU WITH US."

 

  "PERHAPS," SAID KONEV TIGHTLY, "BUT IN THE MEANWHILE, I THINK THE
WHITE CELL TOOK US ON AN EXCURSION. WE ARE NOT WHERE WE WERE AND I DO
NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE."

 

  42.

 

  BORANOVA'S LIPS TIGHTENED AND SHE ASKED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY, "HOW CAN
YOU NOT KNOW WHERE WE ARE? WE WERE INSIDE THE WHITE CELL ONLY A FEW
MINUTES. IT COULDN'T HAVE MOVED US INTO THE LIVER, COULD IT?"

 

  KONEV SEEMED AT LEAST EQUALLY UPSET. "NO, WE'RE NOT IN THE LIVER,
MADAME." (HE CAME DOWN HEAVILY ON THE HONORIFIC, GIVING IT THE FRENCH
PRONUNCIATION.) "BUT I SUSPECT THE WHITE CELL, DRAGGING US WITH IT, HAS
TURNED INTO A BRANCHING CAPILLARY SO THAT WE ARE NOW OUT OF THE
MAINSTREAM OF THE ARTERIOLE -- WHICH WAS NOT YET QUITE A CAPILLARY --
THAT WE WERE CAREFULLY FOLLOWING."

 

  "WHICH CAPILLARY DID IT TURN INTO?" ASKED BORANOVA.

 

  "THAT IS WHAT I DON'T KNOW. THERE ARE A DOZEN CAPILLARIES IT MIGHT
HAVE TURNED INTO AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT WAS."

 

  "DOESN'T YOUR RED MARKER --" BEGAN MORRISON.

 

  "MY RED MARKER," SAID KONEV AT ONCE, "WORKS BY DEAD RECKONING. IF I
KNOW WHERE WE ARE AND THE SPEED AT WHICH WE'RE PROGRESSING, IT WILL MOVE
ALONG WITH US, TURNING WHEN I TELL IT TO TURN."

 

  "YOU MEAN," SAID MORRISON INCREDULOUSLY, "IT ONLY MARKS YOUR POSITION
INSOFAR AS YOU KNOW YOUR POSITION -- NO MORE THAN THAT?"

 

  "IT IS NOT A MAGICAL MARKER, NO," SAID KONEV FREEZINGLY. "IT ACTS TO
MARK OUR PLACE AND KEEP TRACK OF IT, LEST WE LOSE IT IN THE CONFUSION OF
THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THE BLOODSTREAM AND THE NEURONIC
NETWORKS, BUT WE HAVE TO GUIDE IT. AT THIS STAGE, IT'S NOT COMPLEX
ENOUGH TO GUIDE ITSELF. IN AN EMERGENCY, WE CAN BE LOCATED FROM OUTSIDE,
BUT THAT'S A TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS."

 

  IT SEEMED TO BE TIME FOR SOMEONE TO ASK A CLASSICALLY FOOLISH QUESTION
AND THAT SOMEONE TURNED OUT TO BE DEZHNEV. HE SAID, "WHY SHOULD THE
WHITE CELL HAVE TURNED OFF INTO A CAPILLARY?"

 

  KONEV TURNED RED. SPEAKING SO RAPIDLY THAT MORRISON COULD HARDLY MAKE
OUT THE RUSSIAN, HE SAID, "AND HOW SHOULD I KNOW THAT? AM I PRIVY TO THE
THOUGHT PROCESSES OF A WHITE CELL?"

 

  "THAT'S ENOUGH," SAID MORRISON SHARPLY. "WE'RE NOT HERE TO FIGHT WITH
EACH OTHER." (HE NOTED THE QUICK LOOK THAT BORANOVA HAD SHOT TOWARD HIM
AND HE CHOSE TO INTERPRET IT AS REPRESENTING GRATITUDE.)

 

  "ACTUALLY," HE WENT ON, "THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE. WE'RE IN A CAPILLARY.
VERY WELL. THE CURRENT IS AT A CREEPING PACE IN CAPILLARIES, SO WHERE IS
THE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING USE OF THE FAMOUS MICROFUSION ENGINES? IF YOU
PUT THEM INTO REVERSE, WE WILL JUST BACK OUT OF THIS CAPILLARY AND
EVENTUALLY -- NOT A VERY LONG EVENTUALLY, EITHER -- WE WILL BE BACK AT
THE JUNCTION POINT AND IN THE ARTERIOLE AGAIN. THEN WE CONTINUE ONWARD
UNTIL WE GET TO THE PROPER TURNOFF AND INTO THE PROPER CAPILLARY. WE'LL
HAVE LOST A LITTLE TIME AND SPENT A LITTLE POWER, THAT'S ALL."

 

  MORRISON'S STATEMENT WAS GREETED WITH SOLEMN STARES. EVEN KONEV, WHO
GENERALLY SPOKE -- WHEN HE DID -- WITH HIS FACE STEADFASTLY FORWARD,
TURNED NOW, HIS ANGRY FROWN CONCENTRATED ON MORRISON.

 

  MORRISON SAID UNEASILY, "WHY ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? IT'S
A PERFECTLY NATURAL COURSE OF PROCEDURE. IF YOU HAD BEEN DRIVING A CAR
AND ACCIDENTALLY TURNED INTO A NARROW ALLEY AND FOUND IT THE WRONG ONE,
WOULDN'T YOU BACK OUT?"

 

  BORANOVA WAS SHAKING HER HEAD. "ALBERT, I'M SORRY. WE HAVE NO
REVERSE."

 

  "WHAT?" MORRISON STARED AT HER BLANKLY.

 

  "WE HAVE NO REVERSE. WE HAVE ONLY A FORWARD DRIVE. NOTHING MORE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO -- NO REVERSE GEAR AT ALL?"

 

  "NONE."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND AT THE OTHER FOUR FACES AND THEN BURST OUT, "OF
ALL THE STUPID, INCOMPETENT, MADDENING SITUATIONS. IT'S ONLY IN THE
SOV--"

 

  HE STOPPED.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "FINISH THE THOUGHT. YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT IT'S
ONLY IN THE SOVIET UNION THAT SUCH A SITUATION WOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ARISE."

 

  MORRISON SWALLOWED, THEN SAID GRUMPILY, "I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT, YES.
IT MIGHT BE AN ILL-TEMPERED STATEMENT, BUT I'M ANGRY -- AND THE
STATEMENT MAY BE TRUE, AT THAT."

 

  "AND DO YOU THINK WE'RE NOT ANGRY, ALBERT?" SAID BORANOVA WITH HER
GLANCE LEVEL UPON HIM. "DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A
SHIP LIKE THIS? YEARS! MANY YEARS! SINCE MINIATURIZATION FIRST SEEMED TO
BECOME A PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY, WE HAVE BEEN THINKING OF ENTERING A
BLOODSTREAM SOMEDAY AND EXPLORING THE WORKING MAMMALIAN BODY -- IF NOT
THE HUMAN BODY -- FROM WITHIN.

 

  "BUT THE MORE WE PLANNED AND THE MORE WE DESIGNED, THE MORE EXPENSIVE
THE PROJECT GREW, AND THE MORE STUBBORN THE BUDGETEERS IN MOSCOW BECAME
IN RESPONSE. I CAN'T BLAME THEM; THEY HAD TO BALANCE THE EXPENSE OF THIS
PROJECT AGAINST OTHER EXPENSES IN AREAS THAT WERE FAR LESS PROBLEMATICAL
THAN MINIATURIZATION WAS. SO, AS A RESULT, THE SHIP GREW SIMPLER AND
SIMPLER IN CONCEPT, AS WE CUT OUT FIRST THIS, THEN THAT, THEN THE OTHER
THING. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU AMERICANS WERE BUILDING YOUR FIRST
SHUTTLES? WHAT YOU PLANNED AND WHAT YOU GOT?

 

  "IN ANY CASE, WE ENDED UP WITH AN UNPOWERED CRAFT, FIT FOR OBSERVATION
ONLY. WE PLANNED TO ENTER THE BLOODSTREAM AND LET THE CURRENT CARRY US
WHERE IT WOULD. WHEN WE HAD ALL THE INFORMATION WE COULD GET, WE WOULD
SLOWLY DEMINIATURIZE. THIS WOULD KILL THE ANIMAL WHICH WE HAD BEEN
STUDYING -- IT WOULD ONLY BE AN ANIMAL, OF COURSE, BUT EVEN SO SOME OF
US AGONIZED OVER THAT. THAT WAS ALL THIS SHIP WAS PLANNED FOR. NOTHING
MORE. WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT WE WOULD SUDDENLY BE FACED WITH A
SITUATION IN WHICH WE HAD TO INVADE A HUMAN BODY, IN WHICH WE HAD TO GET
TO A SPECIFIC SPOT IN THE BRAIN, IN WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO EMERGE
WITHOUT KILLING THE BODY. IN WHICH WE HAD TO -- AND ALL WE HAD WAS THIS
SHIP, WHICH WAS NOT MEANT FOR THE JOB AT ALL."

 

  THE ANGER AND CONTEMPT ON MORRISON'S FACE HAD VANISHED INTO A FROWN OF
CONCERN. "WHAT DID YOU DO?"

 

  "WE WORKED AS FAST AS WE COULD. WE IMPROVED THE MICROFUSION MOTORS AND
A FEW OTHER THINGS, FRIGHTENED THAT AT ANY MOMENT SHAPIROV WOULD DIE,
AND EQUALLY FRIGHTENED -- OR MORE SO -- THAT OUR HURRY WOULD CAUSE US TO
MAKE SOME FATAL MISTAKE. WELL, I DON'T THINK WE MADE ANY FATAL MISTAKES,
BUT STILL THE MICROFUSION MOTORS WE ENDED UP WITH WERE TO BE USED FOR
ACCELERATION ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- THEY HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN
DESIGNED ONLY FOR LIGHTING, AIR-CONDITIONING, AND OTHER LOW-ENERGY USES.
OF COURSE, WE LACKED THE TIME TO DO A COMPLETE JOB, SO -- NO REVERSE
GEAR."

 

  "DIDN'T ANYONE POINT OUT THAT THERE MIGHT JUST BE A CHANCE YOU WOULD
WANT TO GO INTO REVERSE?"

 

  "THAT WOULD MEAN MORE MONEY AND THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD. AFTER ALL,
WE HAD TO COMPETE WITH SPACE, WHICH WAS A GOING CONCERN, WITH THE
REALISTIC NEEDS OF AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE, INDUSTRY, CRIME CONTROL, AND
HALF A HUNDRED OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT ALL CLUTCHING AT THE
NATIONAL PURSE. OF COURSE WE NEVER HAD ENOUGH."

 

  DEZHNEV SIGHED AND SAID, "AND SO HERE WE ARE. AS MY GOOD FATHER USED
TO SAY: 'ONLY SIMPLETONS GO TO FORTUNE-TELLERS. WHO ELSE WOULD BE IN
SUCH A HURRY TO HEAR BAD NEWS?'"

 

  "YOUR FATHER IS TELLING ME NOTHING I DON'T KNOW, ARKADY. AT LEAST WITH
THAT REMARK. I'M AFRAID TO ASK, BUT CAN WE SIMPLY TURN THE SHIP?"
MORRISON ASKED.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "YOU ARE WISE TO BE AFRAID. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE
CAPILLARY IS TOO NARROW. THE SHIP HAS NO ROOM TO TURN."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD IMPATIENTLY. "YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN THE
SHIP'S PRESENT SIZE. SHRINK IT A BIT. MINIATURIZE IT. YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO MINIATURIZE ANYWAY BEFORE GETTING INSIDE A CELL. DO IT NOW AND
TURN IT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID MILDLY, "AND IN THE SECOND PLACE, WE CAN'T TURN IT ANY
MORE THAN WE CAN GO BACKWARD. WE HAVE A FORWARD GEAR AND THAT IS ALL."

 

  "UNBELIEVABLE," WHISPERED MORRISON TO HIMSELF. THEN ALOUD, "HOW COULD
YOU CONSENT TO BEGIN THIS PROJECT WITH SO INADEQUATE A SHIP?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "WE HAD NO CHOICE AND WE WERE NOT COUNTING ON PLAYING
GAMES WITH WHITE CELLS."

 

  BORANOVA, HER FACE EXPRESSIONLESS, HER VOICE TONELESS, SAID, "IF THE
PROJECT FAILS, I WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY."

 

  KALIININ LOOKED UP AND SAID, "NATALYA, ASSIGNING BLAME WILL NOT HELP
US. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE MUST GO AHEAD. LET US MOVE ON,
MINIATURIZE IF WE HAVE TO, AND FIND SOME LIKELY CELL TO ENTER."

 

  "ANY CELL?" SAID KONEV IN A STIFLED FURY, AND ADDRESSING NO ONE. "ANY
CELL? WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO?"

 

  "WE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING USEFUL ANYWHERE WE GO, NATALYA," SAID
KALIININ.

 

  WHEN KONEV MADE NO RESPONSE, BORANOVA SAID, "IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO
THAT, YURI?"

 

  "OBJECTION? OF COURSE THERE'S OBJECTION." HE DID NOT TURN, BUT HIS
VERY BACK SEEMED STIFF WITH ANGER. "WE HAVE TEN BILLION NEURONS IN THE
BRAIN AND SOMEONE IS SUGGESTING THAT WE WANDER AMONG THEM BLINDLY AND
CHOOSE ONE AT RANDOM. IT WOULD BE AN EASIER TASK TO DRIVE ALONG EARTH'S
ROADS IN AN AUTOMOBILE AND RANDOMLY CHOOSE SOME HUMAN BEING ON THE
WAYSIDE IN THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE A LONG-LOST RELATIVE. MUCH EASIER.
THE NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF THE
NUMBER OF NEURONS IN THE BRAIN."

 

  "THAT IS A FALSE ANALOGY," SAID KALIININ, CAREFULLY TURNING HER FACE
TOWARD BORANOVA. "WE ARE NOT ENGAGED IN A BLIND SEARCH. WE ARE LOOKING
FOR PYOTR SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS. ONCE WE DETECT THEM, WE NEED ONLY MOVE IN
THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE THOUGHTS STRENGTHEN."

 

  "IF YOU CAN," SAID MORRISON, SHAKING HIS HEAD. "IF YOUR SINGLE FORWARD
GEAR HAPPENS TO BE CARRYING YOU IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE THOUGHTS
WEAKEN, WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?"

 

  "EXACTLY," SAID KONEV. "I HAD PLOTTED OUT A COURSE THAT WOULD HAVE
TAKEN US DIRECTLY TO AN IMPORTANT JUNCTION IN THE PARTICULAR NEURONIC
NETWORK THAT IS RELATED TO ABSTRACT THOUGHT -- ACCORDING TO ALBERT'S
RESEARCHES. THE BLOODSTREAM WOULD HAVE CARRIED US THERE AND WHATEVER
TORTUOUS PATH IT TOOK, THE SHIP WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED. AND NOW --" HE
LIFTED BOTH HIS ARMS AND SHOOK THEM AT THE UNRESPONSIVE UNIVERSE.

 

  "NEVERTHELESS," SAID BORANOVA, HER VOICE STRAINED, "I DON'T SEE THAT
WE HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO DO WHAT SOPHIA SUGGESTS. IF THAT FAILS, WE
MUST FIND A WAY OUT OF THE BODY AND PERHAPS TRY AGAIN ANOTHER DAY."

 

  "WAIT, NATALYA," SAID MORRISON. "THERE JUST MAY BE ANOTHER WAY TO
REMEDY THE SITUATION. IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE FOR ONE OF US TO GET OUTSIDE
THE SHIP AND INTO THE BLOODSTREAM?"

 

  43.

 

  MORRISON DID NOT EXPECT AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER. THE SHIP, WHICH HAD
SEEMED TO HIM EARLIER TO BE A MARVELOUS EXAMPLE OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY, HAD
NOW SHRUNK IN HIS IMAGINATION TO A STRIPPED-DOWN SCOW OF WHICH NOTHING
AT ALL COULD BE EXPECTED.

 

  IT SEEMED TO HIM BEST, FROM ANY PRACTICAL STANDPOINT, TO DO AS
KALIININ HAD SUGGESTED -- TO TRY ANY BRAIN CELL THEY COULD REACH. BUT IF
THAT FAILED, IT WOULD MEAN GETTING OUT OF THE BODY AND TRYING AGAIN, AS
BORANOVA HAD JUST SAID, AND MORRISON DID NOT FEEL HE WOULD BE PHYSICALLY
CAPABLE OF GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN. HE WOULD TRY ANY WILD SCHEME TO
PREVENT THAT.

 

  "IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF THIS SHIP, NATALYA?" HE ASKED AGAIN AS
SHE LOOKED AT HIM, DAZED. (THE OTHERS WERE NO MORE RESPONSIVE.) "--
LOOK, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO COLLECT SAMPLES? DO YOU
HAVE A DREDGE, A SCOOP, A NET? OR CAN SOMEONE GET OUTSIDE AND GO SCUBA
DIVING?"

 

  BORANOVA FINALLY SEEMED TO OVERCOME HER SURPRISE AT THE QUESTION. HER
HEAVY EYEBROWS LIFTED INTO AN ATTITUDE OF WONDER. "YOU KNOW, WE DO. ONE
DIVING SUIT FOR RECONNOITERING, THE PLANS SAY. IT SHOULD BE UNDER THE
BACK ROW SEATS. UNDER HERE, IN FACT."

 

  SHE UNCLASPED HERSELF AND WENT INTO A SLOW FLOAT, THEN MANAGED TO PULL
HERSELF INTO A HORIZONTAL POSITION, HER LIGHT COTTON CLOTHING BILLOWING.

 

  "IT'S HERE, ALBERT," SHE SAID. "I PRESUME IT HAS BEEN CHECKED -- I
MEAN, AGAINST GROSS ERRORS. THERE WOULD BE NO LEAKS, NO OBVIOUS FLAWS. I
DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN FIELD-TESTED."

 

  "HOW COULD IT BE?" SAID MORRISON. "I TAKE IT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THE SHIP -- OR ANYTHING -- HAS BEEN IN A BLOODSTREAM."

 

  "I IMAGINE IT MUST HAVE BEEN CHECKED IN WARM WATER ADJUSTED TO THE
PROPER VISCOSITY. I BLAME MYSELF FOR NOT CHECKING ON THIS, BUT OF COURSE
THERE WAS NO THOUGHT AT ANY TIME OF ANYONE LEAVING THE SHIP. I HAD EVEN
FORGOTTEN THE SUIT EXISTED."

 

  "DO YOU AT LEAST KNOW IF THE SUIT HAS AN AIR SUPPLY?"

 

  "INDEED IT DOES," SAID BORANOVA WITH SONIE ASPERITY. "AND IT HAS A
POWER SUPPLY THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR IT TO HAVE A LIGHT OF ITS OWN.
YOU MUSTN'T THINK OF US AS UTTER INCOMPETENTS, ALBERT. --THOUGH," SHE
SAID WITH A RUEFUL SHRUG, "I SUPPOSE WE -- OR, AT LEAST, I -- HAVE GIVEN
YOU SOME REASON TO THINK SO."

 

  "DOES THE SUIT HAVE FLIPPERS?"

 

  "YES, ON BOTH HANDS AND FEET. IT IS MEANT FOR MANEUVERING IN FLUID."

 

  "IN THAT CASE," SAID MORRISON, "THERE IS PERHAPS A WAY OUT."

 

  "WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF, ALBERT?" ASKED KALIININ.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "SUPPOSE WE MINIATURIZE A BIT FURTHER SO THAT THE SHIP
CAN TURN EASILY WITHOUT SCRAPING THE CAPILLARY WALLS. SOMEONE THEN GETS
INTO THE SUIT, MOVES OUTSIDE THE SHIP -- ASSUMING YOU HAVE AN AIR LOCK
OF SOME SORT -- AND, PROPELLING HIMSELF BY MEANS OF THE FLIPPERS, TURNS
THE SHIP. ONCE THE SHIP IS TURNED, THE PERSON GETS BACK INTO THE SHIP,
WHICH IS NOW FACING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION. THE MOTOR IS STARTED AND
WE PUSH OUR WAY BACK AGAINST THE FEEBLE CAPILLARY CURRENT TO THE JOINING
WITH THE ARTERIOLE AND THUS BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL PATH."

 

  BORANOVA SAID THOUGHTFULLY, "A DESPERATE REMEDY, BUT OUR CONDITION,
TOO, IS DESPERATE. HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANY SCUBA DIVING, ALBERT?"

 

  "SOME," SAID MORRISON. "THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT OF THIS."

 

  "AND NONE OF US HAVE -- WHICH IS WHY WE DIDN'T THINK OF IT. IN THAT
CASE, ALBERT, UNCLASP YOURSELF AND LET US GET THIS SUIT ON YOU."

 

  "ON ME?" MORRISON SPUTTERED.

 

  "OF COURSE. IT IS YOUR IDEA AND YOU'RE THE ONE WITH EXPERIENCE."

 

  "NOT IN THE BLOODSTREAM."

 

  "NO ONE HAS EXPERIENCE IN THE BLOODSTREAM, BUT THE REST OF US DON'T
EVEN HAVE IT IN WATER."

 

  "NO," SAID MORRISON SAVAGELY. "THIS THING IS YOUR BABY -- YOU FOUR.
I'VE DONE THE THINKING THAT GOT YOU OUT OF THE WHITE CELL AND I'VE JUST
DONE THE THINKING THAT COULD GET YOU OUT OF YOUR PRESENT FIX. THAT'S MY
SHARE. YOU DO THE DOING. ONE OF YOU."

 

  "ALBERT," SAID BORANOVA. "WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. IN HERE, WE ARE
NEITHER SOVIETS NOR AMERICANS; WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS TRYING TO SURVIVE AND
TO ACCOMPLISH A GREAT TASK. WHO DOES WHAT DEPENDS ON WHO CAN DO WHAT
BEST, AND NOTHING MORE."

 

  MORRISON CAUGHT KALIININ'S EYE. SHE WAS SMILING VERY SLIGHTLY AND
MORRISON THOUGHT HE COULD READ ADMIRATION IN THAT SMILE.

 

  GROANING SOFTLY AT THE FOLLY OF BEING INFLUENCED IN SO CHILDISH A
MANNER BY A HUNGER FOR ADMIRATION, MORRISON KNEW HE WOULD AGREE TO THIS
MADNESS OF HIS OWN SUGGESTION.

 

  44.

 

  BORANOVA HAD THE SUIT OUT. LIKE THE SHIP ITSELF, IT WAS TRANSPARENT,
AND, EXCEPT IN THE HEAD PORTION, IT LAY WRINKLED AND FLAT. TO MORRISON,
IT LOOKED UNPLEASANTLY LIKE A LIFE-SIZED CARICATURE OF A HUMAN BEING
DRAWN IN OUTLINE BY A CHILD.

 

  HE REACHED OUT TO TOUCH IT AND SAID, "WHAT IS IT MADE OF? PLASTIC
WRAP?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "NO, ALBERT. IT IS THIN, BUT IT IS NOT WEAK AND IT IS
EXCEEDINGLY TOUGH AND INERT. NO FOREIGN MATERIAL WILL CLING TO IT AND IT
SHOULD BE PERFECTLY LEAKPROOF."

 

  "SHOULD BE?" ECHOED MORRISON SARDONICALLY.

 

  DEZHNEV INTERRUPTED. "IT IS LEAKPROOF. I SEEM TO RECALL IT WAS TESTED
SOME TIME AGO."

 

  "YOU SEEM TO RECALL IT."

 

  "I BLAME MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING CHECKED IT PERSONALLY IN GOING OVER THE
SHIP, BUT I, TOO, FORGOT ITS EXISTENCE. THERE WAS NO THOUGHT --"

 

  MORRISON BITTERLY EXCLAIMED, "I'M SURE YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE TOLD YOU
ONCE THAT SELF-BLAME IS A CHEAP PENALTY FOR INCOMPETENCE, ARKADY."

 

  DEZHNEV REPLIED, RASPINGLY, "I AM NOT INCOMPETENT, ALBERT."

 

  BORANOVA CUT IN, "WE WILL HAVE OUR FIGHTS WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER.
ALBERT, THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. EVEN IF THERE WERE A
MICROSCOPIC LEAK, THE WATER MOLECULES IN THE PLASMA OUTSIDE ARE FAR
LARGER IN COMPARISON TO THE SUIT THAN THEY WOULD BE UNDER NORMAL
CONDITIONS. A LEAK IN A NORMAL SUIT MIGHT LET IN NORMAL WATER MOLECULES,
BUT THAT SAME LEAK IN A MINIATURIZED SUIT WOULD NOT ALLOW THOSE SAME
WATER MOLECULES, NOW GIANTS IN COMPARISON, TO ENTER."

 

  "THAT MAKES SENSE," MUTTERED MORRISON, LOOKING FOR SOLACE.

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID BORANOVA. "WE CAN INSERT A STANDARD OXYGEN CYLINDER
RIGHT HERE -- SMALL SIZE, BUT YOU WON'T BE OUT THERE FOR LONG -- AN
ABSORPTION CANISTER FOR CARBON DIOXIDE HERE, AND A BATTERY FOR THE
LIGHT. SO, YOU SEE, YOU WILL BE EQUIPPED."

 

  "JUST THE SAME," SAID KONEV, TURNING TO LOOK AT MORRISON
DISPASSIONATELY, "YOU HAD BETTER DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT'S WARM
OUT THERE -- THIRTY-SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS -- AND I DON'T THINK THE SUIT
HAS A COOLING MECHANISM."

 

  "NO COOLING MECHANISM?" MORRISON LOOKED AT BORANOVA QUESTIONINGLY.

 

  BORANOVA SHRUGGED. "IT IS NOT EASY TO COOL AN OBJECT IN AN ISOTHERMAL
MEDIUM. THIS ENTIRE BODY, WHICH IS AS LARGE AS A MOUNTAIN TO US, IS ALL
AT A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE OF THIRTY-SEVEN. THE SHIP ITSELF CAN BE COOLED
BY MEANS OF THE MICROFUSION ENGINES. WE CAN'T BUILD AN EQUIVALENT DEVICE
INTO THE SUIT, BUT THEN, AS WE KEEP SAYING, YOU WON'T BE OUT FOR VERY
LONG. -- STILL, YOU HAD BETTER TAKE OFF THE SUIT YOU'RE WEARING NOW,
ALBERT."

 

  MORRISON DEMURRED. "IT'S NOT HEAVY, JUST A THIN LAYER OF COTTON."

 

  "IF YOU PERSPIRE WITH IT ON," SAID BORANOVA, "YOU WILL BE SITTING IN
WET CLOTHES WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE SHIP. WE HAVE NO SPARE CLOTHING WE
CAN OFRER YOU."

 

  "WELL, IF YOU INSIST," MORRISON SAID. THEN HE REMOVED HIS SANDALS AND
TRIED TO STRIP HIS ONE-PIECER OFF HIS LEGS, SOMETHING WHICH PROVED
SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT IN HIS NEARLY WEIGHTLESS STATE.

 

  BORANOVA, NOTING HIS DISCOMFORT, SAID, "ARKADY, PLEASE HELP ALBERT
INTO THE SUIT."

 

  DEZHNEV WORKED HIS WAY, WITH DIFFICULTY, OVER THE BACK OF HIS SEAT TO
WHERE MORRISON FLOATED, IN A CRAMPED POSTURE, AGAINST THE HULL OF THE
SHIP.

 

  DEZHNEV HELPED MORRISON INTO THE LEGS OF THE SUIT ONE AT A TIME,
THOUGH THE TWO, WORKING TOGETHER, WERE SCARCELY LESS CLUMSY THAN
MORRISON ALONE HAD BEEN. (EVERYTHING ABOUT US, MORRISON THOUGHT, IS
DESIGNED TO WORK IN THE PRESENCE OF GRAVITY.)

 

  DEZHNEV MAINTAINED A RUNNING COMMENTARY AS THEY STRUGGLED. "THE
MATERIAL OF THIS SUIT," HE SAID, "IS PRECISELY THAT OF THE SHIP ITSELF.
ENTIRELY SECRET, OF COURSE, THOUGH, FOR ALL I KNOW, YOU HAVE A SIMILAR
MATERIAL IN THE UNITED STATES -- ALSO SECRET, I AM SURE." HE PAUSED ON A
SMALL NOTE OF INQUIRY.

 

  "I WOULDN'T KNOW," MUTTERED MORRISON. HIS BARE LEG WORKED ITS WAY INTO
A SHEATH OF THIN PLASTIC. IT DIDN'T STICK TO HIS LEG, BUT MOVED SMOOTHLY
ALONG, YET IT SOMEHOW GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING COLD AND WET WITHOUT,
IN REALITY, BEING EITHER. HE HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED A SURFACE QUITE LIKE
THAT OF THE PLASTIC SUIT AND HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO INTEPRET THE
SENSATION.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "WHEN THE SEAMS CLOSE, THEY BECOME VIRTUALLY A SINGLE
PIECE OF MATERIAL."

 

  "HOW DO THEY OPEN AGAIN?"

 

  "THE ELECTROSTATICS CAN BE NEUTRALIZED ONCE YOU'RE BACK IN THE SHIP.
FOR NOW, MOST OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE SUIT HAS A MILD NEGATIVE CHARGE,
BALANCED BY A POSITIVE ONE ON THE INNER SURFACE. ANY PORTION OF THE SUIT
WILL CLING TO ANY POSITIVELY CHARGED AREA ON THE SHIP'S SURFACE, BUT NOT
SO STRONGLY THAT YOU CAN'T PULL LOOSE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHAT ABOUT THE REAR END OF THE SHIP WHERE THE ENGINES
ARE?"

 

  "YOU NEED NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. THEY ARE WORKING AT MINIMUM
POWER FOR OUR COOLING AND ILLUMINATION AND ANY PARTICLES EMERGING FROM
THEM WILL PASS THROUGH YOU WITHOUT NOTICING YOUR PRESENCE AT ALL. THE
OXYGEN CYLINDERS AND WASTE ABSORPTION WORK AUTOMATICALLY. YOU WILL
PRODUCE NO BUBBLES. YOU NEED ONLY BREATHE NORMALLY."

 

  "ONE MUST BE GRATEFUL FOR SOME TECHNOLOGICAL BLESSINGS."

 

  DEZHNEV FROWNED AND SAID DARKLY, "IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT SOVIET
SPACESUITS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND THE JAPANESE ARE SECOND."

 

  "BUT THIS IS NOT A SPACESUIT."

 

  "IT IS MODELED ON ONE IN MANY WAYS." DEZHNEV MADE AS THOUGH TO PULL
THE HEADPIECE DOWN.

 

  "WAIT," SAID MORRISON. "WHAT ABOUT A RADIO?"

 

  DEZHNEV PAUSED. "WHY WOULD YOU NEED A RADIO?"

 

  "TO COMMUNICATE."

 

  "YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE US, AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.
EVERYTHING IS TRANSPARENT. YOU CAN SIGNAL TO US."

 

  MORRISON DREW A DEEP BREATH. "IN OTHER WORDS, NO RADIO."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I AM SORRY, ALBERT. IT IS REALLY ONLY A VERY SIMPLE
SUIT FOR SMALL TASKS."

 

  MORRISON SAID SOURLY, "STILL, IF YOU DO A THING, IT'S WORTH DOING
WELL."

 

  "NOT TO BUREAUCRATS," SAID DEZHNEV. "TO THEM, IF YOU DO A THING, IT'S
WORTH DOING CHEAPLY."

 

  THERE WAS ONE ADVANTAGE OF IRRITATION AND ANNOYANCE, THOUGHT MORRISON;
IT DID TEND TO WIPE OUT FEAR. HE SAID, "HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET ME OUT OF
THE SHIP?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING, THE HULL IS DOUBLE."

 

  MORRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO LOOK AND, OF COURSE, WENT FLOUNDERING. HE
COULD NOT SEEM TO REMEMBER FOR THREE SECONDS RUNNING THAT HE WAS
ESSENTIALLY WEIGHTLESS. DEZHNEV HELPED HIM CONTROL HIS BODY AT SOME COST
TO HIMSELF (WE MUST LOOK LIKE A PAIR OF CLOWNS, MORRISON THOUGHT.)

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF STARING, AT LAST, AT THE INDICATED PORTION OF
THE HULL. NOW THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO IT, IT DID SEEM FAINTLY
LESS TRANSPARENT THAN THE OTHER PORTIONS, BUT THAT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN
HIS IMAGINATION.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "HOLD STILL, ALBERT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'IT IS ONLY
WHEN A CHILD HAS LEARNED TO HOLD STILL THAT IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A
CREATURE OF SENSE.'"

 

  "YOUR FATHER WAS NOT CONSIDERING ZERO-GRAVITY CONDITIONS."

 

  "THE AIR LOCK," SAID DEZHNEV, IGNORING MORRISON'S COMMENT, "IS MODELED
ON THE TYPE WE HAVE IN OUR LUNAR SURFACE ENCLOSURES. THE INNER LAYER OF
THE LOCK WILL PEEL BACK, THEN MOVE AROUND YOU AND SEAL. MOST OF THE AIR
BETWEEN THE LAYERS WILL BE SUCKED OUT -- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE AIR --
WHICH WILL GIVE YOU A STRANGE FEELING, NO DOUBT. THEN THE OUTER LAYER
WILL PEEL OPEN AND YOU WILL BE OUTSIDE. SIMPLE! -- NOW, LET ME CLOSE
YOUR HELMET."

 

  "WAIT! HOW DO I GET BACK?"

 

  "THE SAME WAY. IN REVERSE."

 

  NOW MORRISON WAS CLOSED IN COMPLETELY AND A DEFINITE CLAUSTROPHOBIC
SENSATION HELPED UNSETTLE HIM, AS THE COLDNESS OF FEAR BEGAN TO WIPE OUT
THE SAVING SENSATION OF ANGER.

 

  DEZHNEV WAS PUSHING HIM AGAINST THE HULL AND KONEV, HAVING MANAGED TO
TURN ABOUT IN HIS SEAT, WAS HELPING. THE TWO WOMEN REMAINED CALMLY IN
THEIR SEATS AND WERE STARING INTENTLY.

 

  MORRISON DID NOT FOR A MOMENT FEEL THAT THEY WERE STARING AT HIS BODY;
HE WISHED THEY WERE, IN FACT. THAT WOULD BE RELATIVELY BENIGN. HE WAS
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THEY WERE WATCHING TO SEE IF THE AIR LOCK WOULD WORK,
IF HIS SUIT WOULD WORK, IF HE HIMSELF WOULD REMAIN ALIVE FOR MORE THAN A
FEW MINUTES ONCE HE WAS OUTSIDE THE SHIP.

 

  HE WANTED TO CRY OUT AND CALL OFF EVERYTHING, BUT THE IMPULSE TO DO SO
REMAINED ONLY AN IMPULSE.

 

  HE FELT A SLIPPERY MOTION BEHIND HIM AND THEN THE WHIPPING OF A
TRANSPARENT SHEET BEFORE HIM. IT WAS LIKE THE SEAT BELT CLASPING ITSELF
AROUND HIS WAIST AND CHEST, BUT HERE THE SHEET ENCLOSED HIM ENTIRELY,
HEAD TO TOE, SIDE TO SIDE.

 

  IT CLUNG TO HIM MORE AND MORE TIGHTLY, AS THE AIR BETWEEN WAS PUMPED
OUT. THE MATERIAL OF HIS SUIT SEEMED TO STRAIN OUTWARD AS THE AIR INSIDE
IT PUSHED AGAINST THE DEVELOPING VACUUM OUTSIDE.

 

  AND THEN THE OUTER LAYER OF THE HULL BEHIND HIM WHIPPED AWAY AND HE
FELT A SOFT THRUST THAT SENT HIM TUMBLING OUTWARD AND INTO THE BLOOD
PLASMA WITHIN THE CAPILLARY.

 

  HE WAS OUT OF THE SHIP AND ON HIS OWN.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 11 -- DESTINATION

 

  GOING THERE MAY BE MOST OF THE FUN -- BUT ONLY IF YOU GET THERE IN THE
END.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  45.

 

  IMMEDIATELY, MORRISON FELT THE ENVELOPING WARMTH AND GASPED. AS KONEV
HAD SAID -- THE TEMPERATURE WAS 37 DEGREES CELSIUS. IT WAS THE HEAT OF A
SWELTERING SUMMER DAY AND THERE WAS NO ESCAPE. NO SHADE, NO BREEZE.

 

  HE LOOKED AROUND, GETTING HIS BEARINGS. CLEARLY, BORANOVA HAD
MINIATURIZED THE SHIP FURTHER WHILE HE HAD CLUMSILY CLAMBERED INTO THE
SUIT. THE TILED WALL OF THE CAPILLARY WAS FARTHER AWAY. HE COULD SEE
ONLY A BIT OF IT, FOR BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE WALL WAS A HUGE CLOUDY
OBJECT. A RED CORPUSCLE, OF COURSE. THEN A PLATELET WENT SLIPPING
BETWEEN THE RED CORPUSCLE AND THE WALL, BUT VERY SLOWLY.

 

  ALL OF THEM -- RED CORPUSCLE, PLATELET, HIMSELF, THE SHIP -- WERE
MOVING ALONG WITH THE SMALL CREEPING CURRENT WITHIN THE CAPILLARY, IF
ONE JUDGED BY THE SLOW DRIFTING MOTION OF THE TILINGS IN THE WALL.

 

  MORRISON WONDERED WHY HE FELT THE BROWNIAN MOTION AS LITTLE AS HE DID.
THERE WAS INDEED THE SENSATION OF MOVEMENT AND THE OTHER OBJECTS IN
SIGHT APPEARED TO TREMBLE. EVEN THE TILE MARKS OF THE CAPILLARY WALLS
SEEMED TO SHIFT SOMEHOW, IN A RATHER PECULIAR MANNER.

 

  BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE KEENLY ANALYTICAL. HE HAD TO GET THINGS
DONE AND GET BACK WITHIN THE SHIP.

 

  HE WAS A METER OR SO FROM THE SHIP. (A METER? PURELY SUBJECTIVE. HOW
MANY MICROMETERS -- HOW MANY MILLIONTHS OF A METER WAS HE SEPARATED FROM
THE SHIP IN REAL MEASUREMENTS? HE DIDN'T PAUSE TO TRY TO WORK OUT AN
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION.) HE TWIDDLED HIS FLIPPERS TO GET BACK TO THE
SHIP. THE PLASMA WAS DISTINCTLY MORE VISCOUS THAN SEAWATER --
UNPLEASANTLY SO.

 

  THE HEAT CONTINUED, OF COURSE. IT WOULD NEVER STOP WHILE THE BODY HE
WAS IN REMAINED ALIVE. MORRISON'S FOREHEAD WAS GETTING MOIST. -- COME,
HE HAD TO GET STARTED.

 

  HIS HAND REACHED OUT TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT THE SHIP, BUT IT
TOUCHED NOTHING. IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH IT WERE PUSHING INTO A

SOFT RUBBERY CUSHION OF AIR, ALTHOUGH HIS EYES TOLD HIM THERE WAS
NOTHING BETWEEN THAT PORTION OF THE HULL OF THE SHIP AND HIS SUITED HAND
EXCEPT, AT BEST, A FILM OF FLUID.

 

  A MOMENT OF THOUGHT AND HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE OUTER SKIN OF
HIS SUIT CARRIED A NEGATIVE ELECTRIC CHARGE. SO DID THAT PORTION OF THE
HULL HE WAS TOUCHING. IT WAS REPELLING HIM.

 

  THERE WERE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE HULL, HOWEVER. MORRISON SLID HIS
HANDS ALONG UNTIL HE WAS AWARE OF TOUCHING THE PLASTIC. THAT WAS NOT IN
ITSELF ENOUGH, HOWEVER, FOR HIS HANDS MOVED ALONG THE AREA AS THOUGH IT
WERE INFINITELY SLIPPERY.

 

  AND THEN, ALMOST WITH A CLICK, HIS LEFT HAND FROZE. IT HAD PASSED A
REGION OF POSITIVE CHARGE AND REMAINED IN PLACE. HE TRIED TO PULL FREE
FIRST BY A GENTLE BACKWARD PUSH AND THEN MORE FRANTICALLY. HE MIGHT AS
WELL HAVE BEEN RIVETED TO THE SPOT. HE FELT FARTHER ALONG WITH HIS RIGHT
HAND. ANCHOR THAT AND HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL HIS LEFT HAND FREE.

 

  CLICK. ANCHORED NOW BY HIS RIGHT HAND, HE PULLED AT HIS LEFT. NOTHING
HAPPENED. HE CLUNG TO THE HULL, CRUCIFIED THERE.

 

  DROPS OF PERSPIRATION ROLLED DOWN HIS FOREHEAD AND COLLECTED IN HIS
ARMPITS.

 

  HE SHOUTED USELESSLY, WIGGLING HIS LEGS IN AN ECSTASY OF EFFORT.

 

  THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIM, BUT HOW COULD HE GESTURE TO HIS TRAPPED
HANDS? THE RED CORPUSCLE THAT HAD BEEN COMPANION TO THE SHIP SINCE HE
HAD EMERGED FROM IT DRIFTED CLOSER AND NUDGED HIM AGAINST THE HULL. HIS
CHEST, HOWEVER, DID NOT CLING. LUCKILY, IT WAS NOT UP AGAINST A
POSITIVELY CHARGED REGION.

 

  KALIININ WAS LOOKING TOWARD HIM. HER LIPS WERE MOVING, BUT HE COULD
NOT LIP-READ -- NOT RUSSIAN, AT ANY RATE. SHE DID SOMETHING WITH HER
COMPUTER AND HIS LEFT ARM PULLED FREE. PRESUMABLY, SHE HAD WEAKENED THE
INTENSITY OF THE CHARGE.

 

  HE NODDED HIS HEAD IN WHAT HE HOPED WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A GESTURE
OF THANKS. NOW IT WOULD ONLY BE NECESSARY TO WORK HIS WAY BACK,
POSITIVELY CHARGED AREA BY POSITIVELY CHARGED AREA, UNTIL HE REACHED THE
REAR OF THE SHIP.

 

  HE BEGAN THE MOTION AND FOUND HIMSELF MORE OR LESS PINNED, BUT NOT SO
MUCH THIS TIME BY THE HARSH PULL OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTION AS
BY THE SOFT, PILLOWY PUSH OF THE RED CORPUSCLE.

 

  "GET BACK!" SHOUTED MORRISON, BUT THE RED CORPUSCLE KNEW NOTHING OF
SHOUTS. ITS ROLE WAS PURELY PASSIVE.

 

  MORRISON THRUST AT IT WITH HIS HANDS AND USED HIS LEG FLIPPERS TO PUSH
HARDER. THE ELASTIC SURFACE FILM OF THE RED CELL GAVE AND BELLIED
INWARD, BUT RESISTED MORE STRONGLY, THE MORE IT GAVE UNTIL, FINALLY,
MORRISON WAS PUSHING USELESSLY AND, AS HE TIRED, WAS FORCED BACK AGAINST
THE SHIP.

 

  HE PAUSED TO CATCH HIS BREATH, WHICH WAS DIFFICULT, HOT AND
SWEAT-DRENCHED AS HE WAS. HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WOULD BE DISABLED FIRST
BY DEHYDRATION OR BY THE FEVER WHICH WOULD SURELY COME OVER HIM IF HE
COULD NOT GET RID OF THE HEAT HIS OWN BODY WAS PRODUCING -- AND ALL THE
MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT HE WAS MAKING TO FREE HIMSELF OF THE RED
CORPUSCLE.

 

  HE LIFTED HIS ARM AGAIN AND BROUGHT IT DOWN, THE PLASTIC FLIPPER HELD
EDGEWISE. IT SLICED THROUGH THE PELLICLE OF THE CORPUSCLE, PUNCTURING IT
LIKE A BALLOON. THE SURFACE TENSION OF THE FILM PULLED THE OPENING WIDER
AND WIDER. MATTER EXUDED -- A THIN CLOUD OF GRANULES -- AND THE RED
CORPUSCLE BEGAN TO SHRINK.

 

  MORRISON FELT AS THOUGH HE HAD KILLED AN INOFFENSIVE LIVING CREATURE
AND EXPERIENCED A PANG OF GUILT -- THEN DECIDED THAT THERE WERE
TRILLIONS OF OTHERS IN THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THAT A RED CORPUSCLE
ONLY HAD 120 DAYS OF FUNCTIONING ANYHOW.

 

  NOW HE COULD PULL BACK TOWARD THE REAR.

 

  NO FOG COLLECTED ON THE INNER SURFACE OF HIS SUIT. WHY SHOULD IT? THE
SURFACE WAS AS WARM AS HE WAS AND NOTHING WOULD CLING TO THE PLASTIC
ANYWAY. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOG WAS PROBABLY COLLECTING AS LITTLE POOLS
OF SWEAT IN THIS CORNER AND THAT OF THE SUIT, ROLLING AROUND AS HE DID.

 

  HE WAS BACK AT THE REAR NOW, BACK WHERE THE SHIP'S STREAMLINING FAILED
BECAUSE THE JETS OF EACH OF THE THREE MICROFUSION ENGINES BROKE THE
SMOOTH LINES. HERE HE WAS AS FAR FROM THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE SHIP
AS POSSIBLE. (WITH LUCK, THE OTHER FOUR WOULD MOVE AS CLOSE TO THE FRONT
OF THE SHIP AS THEY COULD. -- HE WISHED HE HAD THOUGHT TO MAKE THAT
EXPLICIT BEFORE GETTING INTO THE SUIT.) WHAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TO FIND
POSITIVELY CHARGED AREAS THAT WOULD HOLD HIS HANDS BACK AND THEN --
PUSH!

 

  HE WAS FEELING A LITTLE DIZZY. PHYSICAL? PSYCHOLOGICAL? THE EFFECT WAS
THE SAME, EITHER WAY.

 

  HE TOOK ANOTHER DEEP BREATH AND BLINKED HIS EYES AS PERSPIRATION
LEAKED INTO THEM (THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD BRUSH IT AWAY AND AGAIN HE
FELT A SPASM OF FURY AGAINST THE FOOLS WHO HAD DESIGNED A SUIT ONLY
MICROSCOPICALLY BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL).

 

  HE FOUND THE HANDHOLDS AGAINST THE HULL AND PADDLED HIS FEET. WOULD
THIS WORK? THE MASS HE WAS TRYING TO TURN WAS ONLY MICROGRAMS IN
QUANTITY, BUT HE HAD AT HIS DISPOSAL -- WHAT? MICROERGS? HE KNEW THAT
THE SQUARE-CUBE LAW GAVE HIM A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE, BUT HOW MUCH
EFFICIENCY COULD HE PUT INTO HIS PUSH?

 

  BUT THE SHIP MOVED. HE COULD TELL THAT BY THE MOTIONS OF THE TILING ON
THE CAPILLARY WALL. HE COULD NOW REACH THAT WALL WITH HIS FEET, SO THE
SHIP MUST BE LYING ACROSS THE CAPILLARY. HE HAD TURNED IT 90 DEGREES.

 

  WHEN HIS FEET TOUCHED THE CAPILLARY WALL, HE PUSHED WITH PERHAPS
INJUDICIOUS SAVAGERY. IF HE WERE TO PUNCH A HOLE IN THE WALL, THE
RESULTS MIGHT BE INCALCULABLY BAD, BUT HE WAS AWARE HE HAD LITTLE TIME
LEFT AND HE COULD NOT THINK BEYOND THAT. FORTUNATELY, HIS FEET REBOUNDED
AS THOUGH THEY HAD SUNK INTO SPONGY RUBBER AND THE SHIP TURNED A BIT
FASTER.

 

  THEN STUCK.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP BLEARILY, SQUINTING AND WILLING HIMSELF TO SEE. (HE
WAS ALMOST PAST THE ABILITY TO BREATHE IN THE SQUALID DAMP HEAT OF THE
SUIT'S INTERIOR.) IT WAS ANOTHER RED CORPUSCLE. SURELY IT WAS ANOTHER
RED CORPUSCLE. THEY WERE AS CLOSELY SPACED IN CAPILLARIES AS -- AS CARS
ON A BUSY CITY STREET.

 

  THIS TIME HE DID NOT WAIT. THE FLIPPER ON HIS RIGHT HAND CAME DOWN AT
ONCE, CARVING OPEN A VAST SWATH, AND THIS TIME HE DID NOT SPEND A
MICROSECOND OF WORRY OVER THE MURDER OF AN INNOCENT OBJECT. HIS LEGS
WORKED AGAIN AND THE SHIP MOVED.

 

  HE HOPED IT WAS SHIFTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS BEFORE. WHAT IF HE
HAD MANAGED TO TWIST HIMSELF UPSIDE DOWN IN HIS MAD ATTACK ON THE RED
CORPUSCLE AND HE WAS SIMPLY PUSHING THE SHIP BACK INTO THE WRONG
DIRECTION? HE WAS ALMOST BEYOND CARING.

 

  THE SHIP WAS NOW PARALLEL TO THE LONG AXIS OF THE CAPILLARY. GASPING,
HE TRIED TO STUDY THE TILES. IF THEY WERE MOVING FORWARD TOWARD THE PROW
OF THE SHIP, THEN THE SHIP WAS MOVING BACKWARD WITH THE CURRENT AND IT
WAS FACING THE JUNCTION OF THE ARTERIOLE.

 

  HE DECIDED IT WAS. NO, HE DIDN'T CARE. RIGHT WAY, WRONG WAY, HE HAD TO
GET BACK INTO THE SHIP.

 

  HE WAS NOT READY TO SELL HIS LIFE FOR SUCCESS.

 

  WHERE? WHERE?

 

  HIS HANDS WERE SLIDING ALONG THE WALLS OF THE SHIP. STICKING HERE.
STICKING THERE.

 

  VAGUELY HE SAW THE DIM FIGURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL.
MOTIONING. HE TRIED TO FOLLOW THE GESTURES.

 

  THEY WERE FADING OUT.

 

  UP? SIGNALING UP? HOW COULD HE CLAMBER UP? HE HAD NO STRENGTH.

 

  HIS LAST TRULY SANE THOUGHT, FOR A WHILE, WAS THAT HE NEEDED NO
STRENGTH. UP MEANT NO MORE THAN DOWN FOR A WEIGHTLESS, MASSLESS BODY.

 

  HE WRIGGLED UPWARD, FORGETTING WHY, AND A FOG OF DARKNESS CAME DOWN
UPON HIM.

 

  46.

 

  THE FIRST THING MORRISON SENSED WAS COLD.

 

  A WAVE OF COLD. THEN A TOUCH OF COLD.

 

  THEN LIGHT.

 

  HE WAS STARING AT A FACE. FOR AN INTERVAL OF TIME, HE DID NOT GRASP
THE FACT THAT IT WAS A FACE. IT WAS JUST A PATTERN OF LIGHT AND SHADE AT
FIRST. THEN A FACE. THEN THE FACE OF SOPHIA KALIININ.

 

  SHE SAID SOFTLY, "DO YOU KNOW ME?"

 

  SLOWLY, CREAKILY, MORRISON NODDED.

 

  "SAY MY NAME."

 

  "SOPHIA," HE CROAKED.

 

  "AND TO YOUR LEFT?"

 

  HIS EYES TURNED, AND DIFFICULTY FOCUSING, THEN HE TURNED HIS HEAD.
"NATALYA," HE SAID.

 

  "HOW DO YOU FEEL?"

 

  "HEADACHE." HIS VOICE SOUNDED SMALL AND FAR AWAY.

 

  "IT WILL GO AWAY."

 

  MORRISON CLOSED HIS EYES AND SURRENDERED TO THE PEACE OF NONSTRUGGLE.
JUST TO DO NOTHING WAS THE HIGHEST GOOD. TO FEEL NOTHING.

 

  THEN HE FELT A COOL STROKE OVER HIS GROIN AND HIS EYES OPENED AGAIN.
HE DISCOVERED THAT THE SUIT HAD BEEN REMOVED AND HE WAS NAKED.

 

  HE FELT ARMS HOLDING HIM DOWN AND HEARD A VOICE SAY, "DON'T WORRY. WE
CAN'T GIVE YOU A SHOWER. THERE'S NO WATER FOR THAT. BUT WE CAN USE A
DAMP TOWEL. YOU NEED TO BE COOLED -- AND CLEANED."

 

  "... UNDIGNIFIED," HE MANAGED, STRUGGLING OVER THE SYLLABLES.

 

  "FOOLISH. WE'LL DRY YOU NOW. A LITTLE DEODORANT. THEN BACK INTO YOUR
ONE-PIECE." MORRISON TRIED TO RELAX. IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE FELT COTTON
AGAINST HIS BODY THAT HE SPOKE AGAIN. HE ASKED, "DID I TURN THE SHIP
PROPERLY?"

 

  "YES," SAID KALIININ, NODDING HER HEAD VIGOROUSLY, "AND FOUGHT OFF TWO
RED CORPUSCLES MOST SAVAGELY. YOU WERE HEROIC."

 

  MORRISON SAID HOARSELY, "HELP ME UP." HE PUSHED DOWN WITH HIS ELBOWS
AGAINST HIS SEAT AND, OF COURSE, DRIFTED INTO THE AIR.

 

  HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN.

 

  "I FORGOT," HE MUTTERED. "WELL, STRAP ME IN. LET ME SIT AND RECOVER."

 

  HE FOUGHT DOWN THE DIZZY FEELING, THEN SAID, "THAT PLASTIC SUIT IS
WORTHLESS. A SUIT FOR USE IN THE BLOODSTREAM OF A WARM-BLOODED ANIMAL
MUST BE COOLED."

 

  "WE KNOW," SAID DEZHNEV FROM HIS SEAT AT THE CONTROLS. "THE NEXT ONE
WILL BE."

 

  "THE NEXT ONE," SPAT MORRISON BITTERLY.

 

  "AT LEAST," SAID DEZHNEV, "YOU DID WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND THE SUIT
MADE THAT POSSIBLE."

 

  "AT A COST," SAID MORRISON, WHO THEN SLIPPED INTO ENGLISH IN ORDER TO
EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS MORE ACCURATELY.

 

  "I UNDERSTOOD THAT," SAID KONEV. "I LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU
KNOW. IF IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO SAY EVERY
ONE OF THOSE WORDS IN RUSSIAN."

 

  "THANKS," SAID MORRISON, "BUT THEY TASTE BETTER IN ENGLISH." HE LICKED
HIS DRY LIPS WITH A DRY TONGUE AND SAID, "WATER WOULD TASTE STILL
BETTER. I'M THIRSTY."

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID KALIININ. SHE HELD A BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS. "SUCK AT IT
GENTLY. IT WON'T POUR WHEN IT HAS NO MASS TO SPEAK OF. -- SLOWLY,
SLOWLY. DON'T WATERLOG YOURSELF."

 

  MORRISON DREW HIS HEAD AWAY FROM THE BOTTLE. "DO WE HAVE ENOUGH
WATER?"

 

  "YOU MUST REPLACE WHAT YOU LOST. WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH."

 

  MORRISON DRANK MORE, THEN SIGHED. "THAT'S MUCH BETTER. -- THERE WAS
SOMETHING I THOUGHT OF WHEN I WAS OUT IN THE CAPILLARY. JUST A FLASH. I
WASN'T SUFFICIENTLY MYSELF TO UNDERSTAND MY OWN THOUGHT." HE BENT HIS
HEAD AND ,COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS. "I'M NOT SUFFICIENTLY MYSELF
TO REMEMBER IT NOW. LET ME THINK."

 

  THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE SHIP.

 

  AND THEN MORRISON SAID WITH A SIGH AND A RATHER MASSIVE CLEARING OF
HIS THROAT. "YES, I REMEMBER IT."

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED ALSO. "GOOD, THEN YOU HAVE YOUR MEMORY."

 

  "OF COURSE I HAVE," SAID MORRISON PETTISHLY. "WHAT DID YOU THINK?"

 

  KONEV SAID COLDLY, "THAT A LOSS OF MEMORY MIGHT BE AN EARLY SIGN OF
BRAIN DAMAGE."

 

  MORRISON'S TEETH CLICKED AS HIS MOUTH SNAPPED SHUT. THEN HE SAID,
FEELING A CHILL IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH. "IS THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT?"

 

  "IT WAS POSSIBLE," SAID KONEV. "AS IN SHAPIROV'S CASE."

 

  "NEVER MIND," SAID KALIININ INSINUATINGLY. "IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. WHAT WAS
YOUR THOUGHT, ALBERT? YOU STILL REMEMBER." IT WAS HALF-CONFIDENT
STATEMENT, HALF-HOPEFUL QUESTION.

 

  "YES, I DO REMEMBER. WE'RE PUSHING UPSTREAM NOW, AREN'T WE? SO TO
SPEAK?"

 

  "YES," SAID DEZHNEV. "I'M USING THE MOTORS -- EXPENDING ENERGY."

 

  "WHEN YOU REACH THE ARTERIOLE, YOU'LL STILL BE HEADING UPSTREAM AND
YOU CAN'T TURN. YOU'LL BE HEADING BACK THE WAY YOU CAME. THE SHIP WILL
HAVE TO BE TURNED AGAIN FROM OUTSIDE. IT CAN'T BE ME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
IT CAN'T BE ME!"

 

  KALIININ PUT HER ARM AROUND HIS SHOULDER. "SHH! IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT
WON'T BE YOU.

 

  "IT WON'T BE ANYONE, ALBERT, MY FRIEND," SAID DEZHNEV JOVIALLY. "LOOK
AHEAD. WE'RE COMING TO THE ARTERIOLE NOW."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP AND FELT A TWINGE OF PAIN. HE MUST HAVE GRIMACED,
FOR KALIININ PUT A COOL HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD AND SAID, "HOW IS YOUR
HEADACHE?"

 

  "GETTING BETTER," SAID MORRISON, SHAKING HER HAND OFF RATHER
QUERULOUSLY. HE WAS PEERING FORWARD AND RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HIS VISION
SEEMED NORMAL. THE CYLINDRICAL TUNNEL UP AHEAD WAS WIDENING SOMEWHAT AND
BEYOND AN ELLIPTICAL LIP HE COULD SEE A DISTANT WALL IN WHICH THE TILING
WAS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "THE CAPILLARY COMES OFF THE ARTERIOLE LIKE THE BRANCH
OF A TREE AT AN OBLIQUE ANGLE. WE GO THROUGH THAT OPENING UP AHEAD AND
WE'LL BE POINTED THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY UPSTREAM -- AND ONCE WE NUDGE
THE FAR WALL, WE'LL BOUNCE OFF AND BE MOVING FULLY UPSTREAM."

 

  DEZHNEV CHUCKLED. "MY OLD FATHER USED TO SAY: 'HALF AN IMAGINATION IS
WORSE THAN NONE AT ALL.' WATCH, LITTLE ALBERT. SEE, I WILL WAIT UNTIL WE
ARE ALMOST AT THE OPENING AND I WILL THROTTLE DOWN THE MOTOR SO THAT WE
MAKE OUR WAY UP THE CURRENT VERY SLOWLY. NOW OUR SHIP STICKS ITS SNOUT
OUT OF THE CAPILLARY -- A LITTLE MORE -- A LITTLE MORE -- AND NOW THE
MAIN STREAM OF ARTERIOLE BLOOD CATCHES US AND PUSHES AGAINST THE NOSE
AND TURNS US -- AND I PUSH OUT A LITTLE MORE -- AND IT TURNS US A BIT
MORE -- AND I COME OUT THE WHOLE WAY -- AND BEHOLD I'VE BEEN TURNED, I
AM HEADING DOWNSTREAM ONCE MORE, AND I CUT THE MOTORS."

 

  HE GRINNED TRIUMPHANTLY. "WASN'T THAT WELL-DONE?"

 

  "WELL-DONE," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT WHAT ALBERT HAD
DONE FIRST."

 

  "TRUE ENOUGH," SAID DEZHNEV, WAVING HIS HAND. "I GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT
AND THE ORDER OF LENIN -- IF HE WILL TAKE IT."

 

  MORRISON FELT INFINITE RELIEF. HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO OUT AGAIN. HE
SAID, "THANK YOU, ARKADY." THEN, RATHER BASHFULLY, HE ADDED, "YOU KNOW,
SOPHIA, I'M STILL THIRSTY."

 

  AT ONCE SHE HANDED HIM THE BOTTLE, BUT HE HESITATED. "ARE YOU SURE I'M
NOT DRINKING MORE THAN MY SHARE, SOPHIA?"

 

  "OF COURSE YOU ARE, ALBERT," SAID KALIININ, "BUT MORE THAN YOUR SHARE
IS YOUR SHARE. COME, WATER IS EASILY RECYCLED. BESIDES, WE HAVE A SMALL
ADDITIONAL SUPPLY. YOU DID NOT FIT INTO THE AIR LOCK NEATLY. AN ELBOW
STUCK WELL OUT AND WE HAD TO CRACK THE INNER LAYER AND PULL IT IN --
WHICH MEANT THE ENTRY OF SOME PLASMA. NOT MUCH, THANKS TO ITS VISCOSITY.
IT'S BEEN MINIATURIZED OF COURSE AND IS BEING RECYCLED NOW."

 

  "ONCE MINIATURIZED, IT CAN'T AMOUNT TO MORE THAN A DROPLET."

 

  "THAT'S ALL IT DOES AMOUNT TO," SAID KALIININ, SMILING, "BUT EVEN A
DROPLET IS AN EXTRA SUPPLY AND SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT IN, YOU DESERVE AN
EXTRA SUPPLY. LOGIC IS LOGIC."

 

  MORRISON LAUGHED AND SUCKED UP ADDITIONAL WATER GREEDILY, SQUEEZING IT
OUT OF THE FLEXIBLE CONTAINER ASTRONAUT-STYLE. HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL
COMPARATIVELY NORMAL -- MORE THAN THAT. HE WAS FEELING THE KIND OF
DREAMY CONTENTMENT THAT COMES FROM BEING FREED FROM THE INTOLERABLE.

 

  HE TRIED TO CONCENTRATE, TO GAIN SOME SENSE OF REALITY, HE WAS STILL
IN THE SHIP. HE WAS STILL THE SIZE OF A BACTERIUM, MORE OR LESS. HE WAS
STILL IN THE BLOODSTREAM OF A MAN IN A COMA. HIS CHANCE OF LIVING
ANOTHER FEW HOURS WAS STILL PROBLEMATICAL. -- AND YET, EVEN AS HE TOLD
HIMSELF ALL THIS, HE NEVERTHELESS COULDN'T FLOG HIMSELF OUT OF THE
FEELING THAT THE MERE ABSENCE OF UNBEARABLE HEAT, THE MERE BEING WITH
OTHERS, THE MERE EXISTENCE OF A WOMAN'S CARE WAS, IN ITSELF, A TOUCH OF
HEAVEN.

 

  HE SAID, "I THANK NOT ONLY ARKADY BUT ALL OF YOU FOR PULLING ME IN AND
CARING FOR ME."

 

  "DON'T BOTHER," SAID KONEV INDIFFERENTLY. "WE NEED YOU AND YOUR
COMPUTER PROGRAM. IF WE HAD LEFT YOU OUT THERE, THE PROJECT WOULD BE A
FAILURE, EVEN IF WE FOUND THE RIGHT CELL."

 

  "THAT MAY BE SO, YURI," SAID BORANOVA, CLEARLY INDIGNANT, "BUT AT THE
TIME WE WERE BRINGING ALBERT IN, I DID NOT THINK OF THAT, BUT ONLY OF
SAVING HIS LIFE. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT EVEN YOU WERE COLD-BLOODED ENOUGH
TO FEEL NO ANXIETY FOR A HUMAN BEING WHO WAS RISKING HIS LIFE TO HELP
US, EXCEPT INSOFAR AS WE NEEDED HIM."

 

  "OBVIOUSLY," MUTTERED KONEV, "PLAIN REASON IS NOT WANTED."

 

  PLAIN REASON WAS CERTAINLY WHAT MORRISON WANTED. SINCE THE MENTION OF
BRAIN DAMAGE, HE HAD BEEN TESTING HIMSELF, THINKING, TRYING TO COME TO
CONCLUSIONS. HE SAID, "ARKADY, WHEN THE MICROFUSION ENGINES ARE WORKING,
YOU ARE CONVERTING MINIATURIZED HYDROGEN INTO MINIATURIZED HELIUM, AND
SOME OF THE HELIUM ESCAPES ALONG WITH MINIATURIZED WATER VAPOR OR OTHER
MATERIALS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE THRUST."

 

  "YES," SAID ARKADY WARILY. "AND IF THAT IS SO, WHAT FOLLOWS?"

 

  "AND THE MINIATURIZED PARTICLES -- ATOMS AND LESS -- SIMPLY ESCAPE
THROUGH SHAPIROV AND THROUGH THE GROTTO AND THROUGH THE EARTH AND END IN
OUTER SPACE, AS YOU TOLD ME."

 

  "AGAIN -- WHAT FOLLOWS?"

 

  "SURELY," SAID MORRISON, "THEY DO NOT STAY MINIATURIZED. WE ARE NOT
INITIATING A PROCESS, ARE WE, IN WHICH THE UNIVERSE WILL GRADUALLY BE
FILLED WITH MINIATURIZED PARTICLES AS HUMANITY PROCEEDS TO MAKE USE OF
MINIATURIZATION MORE AND MORE?"

 

  "IF WE DID, WHAT HARM? ALL HUMAN ACTIVITY FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS COULD
NOT ADD A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MINIATURIZED PARTICLES TO THE
UNIVERSE. BUT IT IS NOT SO. MINIATURIZATION IS A METASTABLE CONDITION,
WHICH MEANS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT A MINIATURIZED PARTICLE
WILL SNAP OUT, SPONTANEOUSLY, TO TRUE STABILITY, THAT IS, TO THE
UNMINIATURIZED STATE." (OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE, MORRISON SAW
BORANOVA RAISE A WARNING HAND, BUT DEZHNEV WAS ALWAYS HARD TO STOP WHEN
IN ORAL FLOOD.)

 

  "NATURALLY," HE WENT ON, "THERE IS NO PREDICTING WHEN A PARTICULAR
MINIATURIZED PARTICLE WILL SNAP OUT OF IT, BUT IT IS A GOOD WAGER THAT
ALMOST ALL WILL BE BEYOND THE MOON WHEN IT HAPPENS. AS FOR THE FEW --
THERE ARE ALWAYS A FEW -- WHO SNAP OUT OF MINIATURIZATION ALMOST AT
ONCE, SHAPIROV'S BODY CAN ABSORB THEM --"

 

  HE THEN SEEMED TO SEE BORANOVA'S GESTURE, WHICH HAD GROWN PEREMPTORY,
AND HE SAID, "BUT I'M BORING YOU. AS MY OLD FATHER SAID ON HIS DEATHBED:
'MY PROVERBS MAY HAVE BORED YOU, BUT NOW YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING
THEM NO MORE, SO THAT YOU WILL MOURN ME LESS AND, THEREFORE, SUFFER
LESS.' THE OLD MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED -- AND DISAPPOINTED,
PERHAPS -- TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE CHILDREN MOURNED HIM, EVEN SO -- BUT I
THINK I WON'T RISK IT WITH MY COMPANIONS IN THIS SHIP --"

 

  "EXACTLY," SNAPPED KONEV, "SO PLEASE STOP, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE ARE NOW
APPROACHING THE CAPILLARY THAT WE SHOULD BE ENTERING. ALBERT, LEAN OVER
AND STUDY THE CEREBROGRAPH. DO YOU AGREE?"

 

  KALIININ, CAREFULLY ADDRESSING BORANOVA, SAID, "ALBERT IS IN NO
CONDITION TO BE BADGERED WITH CEREBROGRAPHS."

 

  "LET ME TRY," SAID MORRISON, STRUGGLING WITH HIS SEAT BELT.

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA WITH AUTHORITY. "YURI CAN MAKE THIS DECISION HIS
OWN RESPONSIBILITY."

 

  "THEN I SO MAKE IT," SAID KONEV, LOOKING SULLEN. "ARKADY, CAN YOU GET
NEAR THE WALL ON OUR RIGHT AND CATCH THE CURRENT THAT TURNS INTO THE
CAPILLARY?"

 

  ARKADY SAID, "I'VE BEEN RACING THE RED CORPUSCLES AND I HAVE CAUGHT
ONE THAT IS DRIFTING TOWARD THE RIGHT WALL. IT WILL PUSH US -- OR THE
SMALL EDDY THAT IS PUSHING IT WILL ALSO PUSH US. -- AH, YOU SEE, IT IS
TAKING PLACE, JUST AS IT DID IN THE PREVIOUS CASES WHERE WE HAD TO
BRANCH OFF. EACH TIME I MANAGED TO USE THE NATURAL CURRENT CORRECTLY." A
BROAD GRIN CREASED HIS HAPPY FACE AS HE SAID, "APPLAUSE, EVERYBODY. SAY,
'WELL-DONE, ARKADY.'"

 

  MORRISON OBLIGINGLY SAID, "WELL-DONE, ARKADY," AND INTO THE CAPILLARY
THE SHIP WENT.

 

  47.

 

  MORRISON HAD RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO BE TIRED OF INVALIDISM. OUTSIDE
THE TRANSPARENT HULL OF THE SHIP, THE WALL OF THE CAPILLARY WAS STRONGLY
TILED AND SEEMED FAIRLY CLOSE ON ALL SIDES. IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THE
OTHER CAPILLARY, THE ONE IN WHICH HE HAD TURNED THE SHIP AROUND.

 

  HE SAID, "I WANT TO SEE THE CEREBROGRAPH."

 

  HE FLUNG OPEN HIS SEAT BELT, THE FIRST REALLY DECISIVE MOVEMENT HE HAD
MADE SINCE RETURNING TO THE SHIP, AND STARED REBELLIOUSLY AT THE
PERTURBED KALIININ AS HE DID SO.

 

  HE PUSHED HIMSELF GENTLY UPWARD INTO A FLOAT, HOLDING HIMSELF IN
POSITION TO LOOK OVER KONEV'S SHOULDERS BY REPEATED CORRECTIONS -- FIRST
UP, THEN DOWN. HE SAID, "HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT ONE,
YURI?"

 

  KONEV LOOKED UP AND SAID, "COUNTING AND DEAD RECKONING. SEE HERE. IF
WE CUT DOWN THE SCALE OF THE CEREBROGRAPH, THIS IS THE ARTERIOLE WE'VE
BEEN FOLLOWING OFF THE CAROTID. WE TOOK THIS BRANCH AND THAT ONE, AND
THEN IT'S A MATTER OF COUNTING THE CAPILLARIES AS THEY BRANCH OFF ON THE
RIGHT.

 

  "WE HAD OUR RUN-IN WITH THE WHITE CELL RIGHT HERE AND IN THE TIME THE
WHITE CELL HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL, THIS CAPILLARY WAS THE ONLY ONE IT COULD
REASONABLY HAVE REACHED. ONCE WE WERE TURNED AROUND AND GOT BACK TO THE
ARTERIOLE, WE FOLLOWED ITS NARROWING STRUCTURE AND MATCHED WHAT WE SAW
AGAINST THE CEREBROGRAPB. THE PATTERN OF BRANCH POINTS OUTSIDE MATCHED
ALMOST EXACTLY THE PATTERN DESCRIBED BY THE CEREBROGRAPH AND THAT ALONE
ASSURES ME WE WERE FOLLOWING THE RIGHT PATH. NOW WE HAVE GONE INTO THIS
CAPILLARY."

 

  MORRISON'S LEFT HAND SLIPPED OFF THE SMOOTH TEXTURE OF THE BACK OF
KONEV'S SEAT AND HIS ATTEMPT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT TWISTED HIM INTO A
COMIC HANDSTAND ON THE OUTSPREAD FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND. HE LABORED
TO RIGHT HIMSELF EVEN AS HE THOUGHT, SAVAGELY, THAT ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT
THAT MUST BE INTRODUCED IN LATER VERSIONS OF THE SHIP WOULD BE HANDHOLDS
ON THE SEATS AND IN OTHER STRATEGIC AREAS.

 

  HE SAID, PANTING, "AND WHERE WILL THIS CAPILLARY TAKE US?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "DIRECTLY TO ONE OF THE CENTERS WHICH YOU BELIEVE TO BE A
CROSSROAD FOR THE PROCESSES OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT. -- LET'S CUT DOWN THE
SCALE OF THE CEREBROGRAPH AGAIN. RIGHT HERE."

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I'VE LOCATED THEM IN HUMAN
BEINGS ONLY INDIRECTLY, JUDGING FROM MY FINDINGS IN ANIMAL BRAINS.
STILL, IF I'M CORRECT, THAT SHOULD BE THE SUPERIOR EXTERNAL SKEPTIC
NODE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "ACCORDING TO YOU, THERE SHOULD BE EIGHT SUCH NODES, FOUR
ON EACH SIDE. THIS ONE, HOWEVER, IS THE LARGEST AND MOST INTRICATE ON
THE LEFT SIDE AND THEREFORE STANDS THE BEST CHANCE OF GIVING US THE DATA
WE NEED. AM I RIGHT?"

 

  "I THINK SO," SAID MORRISON CAUTIOUSLY, "BUT PLEASE REMEMBER THAT MY
REASONING HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY."

 

  "AND DO YOU BEGIN TO DOUBT IT NOW, TOO, ALBERT?"

 

  "CAUTION IS A REASONABLE SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE, YURI. MY CONCEPT OF THE
SKEPTIC NODE MAKES SENSE IN THE LIGHT OF MY OBSERVATIONS, BUT I HAVE
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TEST THE MATTER DIRECTLY -- THAT'S ALL -- AND I DO
NOT WISH IT SAID LATER THAT I MISLED YOU."

 

  DEZHNEV SNICKERED. "SKEPTIC NODE! NO WONDER YOUR COUNTRYMEN ARE
SKEPTICAL OF THE WHOLE NOTION, ALBERT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'PEOPLE
ARE READY ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT YOU. DON'T MAKE FUNNY FACES IN ORDER TO
ENCOURAGE THEM.' -- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL IT 'THOUGHT NODE' IN SIMPLE
RUSSIAN? IT WOULD HAVE SOUNDED MUCH BETTER."

 

  "OR 'THOUGHT NODE' IN SIMPLE ENGLISH," SAID MORRISON PATIENTLY. "BUT
SCIENCE IS INTERNATIONAL AND ONE USES GREEK OR LATIN WHEN POSSIBLE. THE
GREEK WORD FOR 'THOUGHT' IS 'SKEPTIS.' IT HAS GIVEN US 'SKEPTICAL' BOTH
IN ENGLISH AND IN RUSSIAN TO INDICATE A HABITUAL DOUBTING ATTITUDE.
THAT'S BECAUSE THE VERY ACT OF DOUBT IMPLIES THOUGHT. SURELY YOU ALL
KNOW THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ACCEPTING THE FOOLISH DOGMAS FOISTED
ON US BY SOCIAL ORTHODOXY IS TO REFRAIN FROM THINKING."

 

  THERE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE AT THAT, WHEREUPON MORRISON (HAVING
LEFT IT THERE FOR JUST LONG ENOUGH, OUT OF A FAINT MALICE -- HE OWED
THEM THAT MUCH) SAID, "AS HUMAN BEINGS IN ALL NATIONS KNOW."

 

  THE ATMOSPHERE LIGHTENED PERCEPTIBLY AT ONCE AND DEZHNEV SAID, "IN
THAT CASE, WE WILL SEE HOW SKEPTICAL WE NEED BE OF THE SKEPTIC NODE,
WHEN WE REACH IT."

 

  "I HOPE," SAID KONEV WITH A SCOWL, "THAT YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS
SOMETHING TO JOKE ABOUT, YOU CLOWN. THAT NODE IS WHERE WE CAN HOPE TO
DETECT PYOTR SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS. WITHOUT THAT, THIS VENTURE WILL COME
TO NOTHING."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "TO EACH HIS OWN JOB. I WILL TAKE YOU THERE, WITH MY
EXPERT HANDLING OF THE SHIP. ONCE THERE, YOU WILL GET THE THOUGHTS -- OR
ALBERT WILL, IF YOU CANNOT. AND IF YOU DO AS WELL WITH THE THOUGHTS AS I
DO WITH THE SHIP, YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO BE UNHAPPY ABOUT. MY FATHER
USED TO SAY --"

 

  "YOUR FATHER IS BETTER OFF WHERE HE IS," SAID KONEV. "DON'T DIG HIM UP
AGAIN."

 

  "YURI," SAID BORANOVA SHARPLY, "THAT WAS AN UNBEARABLY RUDE REMARK TO
MAKE. YOU MUST APOLOGIZE."

 

  "THAT'S ALL RIGHT," SAID DEZHNEV. "MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THE TIME
FOR OFFENSE IS WHEN A MAN, ONCE HE HAS COOLED DOWN, REPEATS AN INSULT HE
HAS OFFERED IN HIS RAGE.' I AM NOT SURE THAT I CAN ALWAYS FOLLOW THAT
ADVICE, BUT IN HONOR OF MY FATHER, I WILL PASS OVER YURI'S STUPID REMARK
THIS TIME." HE BENT OVER HIS CONTROLS, HIS FACE GRIM.

 

  MORRISON HAD LISTENED TO THE ALTERCATION (JUST KONEV BEING NASTY --
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER A GREAT STRAIN) WITH ONLY HALF AN EAR.
HIS MIND SLIPPED BACK TO SOMETHING ELSE, TO DEZHNEV'S CAREFREE CHATTER
AND BORANOVA'S WARNING HAND.

 

  HE LOWERED HIMSELF INTO HIS SEAT, CLASPING HIMSELF IN FOR STABILITY,
AND TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD BORANOVA. "NATALYA! A QUESTION!"

 

  "YES, ALBERT?"

 

  "THOSE MINIATURIZED PARTICLES RELEASED INTO THE NORMAL, UNMINIATURIZED
UNIVERSE --"

 

  "YES, ALBERT?"

 

  "EVENTUALLY, THEY DEMINIATURIZE."

 

  BORANOVA HESITATED. "AS ARKADY TOLD YOU, THEY DO."

 

  "WHEN?"

 

  SHE SHRUGGED. "UNPREDICTABLY. LIKE THE RADIOACTIVE BREAKDOWN OF A
SINGLE ATOM."

 

  "HOW DO YOU KNOW?"

 

  "BECAUSE IT'S SO."

 

  "I MEAN, WHAT EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED? NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN
MINIATURIZED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE NOW MINIATURIZED, SO SURELY YOU
CAN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO SUCH MINIATURIZED PARTICLES BY DIRECT
OBSERVATION."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE'VE OBSERVED EVENTS AT MINIATURIZATIONS WE HAVE
REACHED AND IN THAT WAY DETERMINED WHAT SEEM TO BE THE LAWS OF BEHAVIOR
OF MINIATURIZED OBJECTS. WE EXTRAPOLATE --"

 

  "EXTRAPOLATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS TRUSTWORTHY WHEN THEY GO WELL OUTSIDE
THE REALM OF DIRECT STUDY."

 

  "GRANTED."

 

  "YOU COMPARED SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION TO RADIOACTIVE BREAKDOWN.
IS THERE A HALF-LIFE OF DEMINIATURIZATION? EVEN IF YOU CAN'T TELL WHEN A
PARTICULAR MINIATURIZED PARTICLE WILL DEMINIATURIZE, CAN YOU TELL WHEN
HALF OF A PARTICULAR LARGE QUANTITY OF THEM WILL?"

 

  "WE HAVE HALF-LIFE FIGURES AND WE THINK THEY ARE EXPRESSIONS OF
FIRST-ORDER KINETICS, AS RADIOACTIVE HALF-LIVES ARE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "CAN YOU GENERALIZE FROM ONE TYPE OF PARTICLE TO
ANOTHER?"

 

  BORANOVA PURSED HER LIPS AND, FOR A MOMENT, SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT.
THEN SHE SAID, "IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE HALF-LIFE OF A MINIATURIZED
OBJECT VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE INTENSITY OF MINIATURIZATION AND ALSO
WITH THE NORMAL MASS OF THE OBJECT."

 

  "SO THAT AS WE ARE MINIATURIZED TO SMALLER AND SMALLER SIZES, THE LESS
TIME WE ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN MINIATURIZED, AND THE SMALLER WE ARE TO
BEGIN WITH, THE LESS TIME WE ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN MINIATURIZED."

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT," REPLIED BORANOVA STIFFLY.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AT HER GRAVELY. "I ADMIRE YOUR INTEGRITY, NATALYA.
YOU'RE NOT ANXIOUS TO TELL ME THINGS. YOU DON'T VOLUNTEER INFORMATION.
STILL, YOU DRAW THE LINE AT MISINFORMING ME."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I AM A HUMAN BEING AND I TELL LIES ON OCCASION OUT OF
NECESSITY OR OUT OF DEFECTS IN MY EMOTIONS OR PERSONALITY. BUT I AM ALSO
A SCIENTIST AND I WOULD NOT TWIST SCIENTIFIC FACT FOR ANY BUT THE MOST
COMPELLING REASONS."

 

  "THEN WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS THIS. EVEN THIS SHIP, ALTHOUGH IT IS MUCH
MORE MASSIVE THAN A HELIUM NUCLEUS, HAS A HALF-LIFE."

 

  "A VERY LONG ONE," PUT IN BORANOVA QUICKLY.

 

  "BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE SO INTENSELY MINIATURIZED HAS CURTAILED THIS
VERY LONG HALF-LIFE."

 

  "STILL LEAVING IT LONG."

 

  "AND WHAT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE SHIP? THE MOLECULES
OF WATER THAT WE DRINK, THE MOLECULES OF AIR WE BREATHE, THE INDIVIDUAL
ATOMS THAT MAKE UP OUR BODY? THEY COULD HAVE -- MUST HAVE -- VERY SHORT
--"

 

  "NO!" SAID BORANOVA FORCEFULLY, SEEMING TO FIND RELIEF IN BEING ABLE
TO DENY SOMETHING. "THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD OVERLAPS WHERE IT DEALS
WITH PARTICLES SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TOGETHER, AND THAT ARE AT REST, OR
NEARLY AT REST, RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER. AN EXTENDED BODY -- SUCH AS THE
SHIP AND EVERYTHING IT CONTAINS -- IS TREATED AS A LARGE BUT SINGLE
PARTICLE AND HAS A HALF-LIFE OF DEMINIATURIZATION TO MATCH. THERE
MINIATURIZATION DIFFERS FROM RADIOACTIVITY."

 

  "AH," SAID MORRISON, "BUT WHEN I WAS OUT OF THE SHIP AND OUT OF
CONTACT WITH IT, COULD IT BE THAT I WAS THEN A SEPARATE PARTICLE WITH A
MUCH SMALLER MASS THAN THE SHIP AND ITS CONTENTS AND THAT I HAD A
MINIATURIZATION HALF-LIFE MUCH SMALLER THAN WE HAVE NOW?"

 

  "I'M NOT SURE," SAID BORANOVA, "WHETHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND THE SHIP WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU A SEPARATE BODY. POSSIBLY IT
DID, FOR THE TIME YOU WERE NOT IN CONTACT."

 

  "AND I THEN HAD A SHORTER HALF-LIFE -- MUCH SHORTER."

 

  "POSSIBLY -- BUT THEN YOU WERE OUT OF CONTACT ONLY A MATTER OF
MINUTES."

 

  "WELL, THEN, WHAT IS THE HALF-LIFE OF THIS SHIP AT THE PRESENT LEVEL
OF MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "WE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK OF THE HALF-LIFE OF A SINGLE OBJECT."

 

  "YES, BECAUSE HALF-LIVES ARE STATISTICAL. FOR ANY PARTICLE,
DEMINIATURIZATION CAN COME, SPONTANEOUSLY, AT ANY TIME, EVEN AFTER A
VERY SHORT TIME AND EVEN THOUGH THE HALF-LIFE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF
SIMILAR PARTICLES WOULD BE QUITE LONG."

 

  "FOR SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION TO COME AFTER A VERY SHORT TIME
WHEN THE STATISTICAL HALF-LIFE IS LONG IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE."

 

  "BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE, IS IT?"

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA. "IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE."

 

  "SO WE CAN SUDDENLY DEMINIATURIZE IN FIVE MINUTES, OR EVEN IN ONE
MINUTE, OR EVEN AS I TAKE MY NEXT BREATH."

 

  "IN THEORY."

 

  "DID YOU ALL KNOW?" HIS EYES DARTED AROUND THE SHIP. "OF COURSE YOU
ALL KNEW. WHY WAS I NOT TOLD?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE ARE VOLUNTEERS, ALBERT, WORKING FOR SCIENCE AND FOR
OUR NATION. WE KNOW ALL THE DANGERS AND ACCEPT THEM. YOU HAVE BEEN
FORCED INTO THIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE MOTIVES THAT DRIVE US. IT SEEMED
POSSIBLE THAT IF YOU KNEW ALL THE DANGERS, YOU WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO
ENTER THE SHIP VOLUNTARILY UNDER ANY PERSUASION OR THAT, BEING BROUGHT
ON BOARD SHIP BY FORCE, YOU WOULD BE ALTOGETHER USELESS TO US OUT OF
SHEER --" SHE PAUSED.

 

  "OUT OF SHEER FRIGHT, YOU WERE GOING TO SAY," SAID MORRISON. "SURELY I
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE AFRAID. THERE IS REASON FOR FEAR."

 

  KALIININ INTERRUPTED, HER VOICE A LITTLE SHRILL. "IT IS TIME TO STOP
HARPING ON ALBERT'S FEAR, NATALYA. IT IS HE WHO LEFT THE SHIP IN AN
INADEQUATE SUIT. IT IS HE WHO TURNED THE SHIP AROUND AT THE RISK OF HIS
LIFE. WHERE WAS HIS FEAR THEN? IF HE FELT IT, HE BOTTLED IT INSIDE AND
DIDN'T LET IT PREVENT HIM FROM DOING WHAT HAD TO BE DONE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "AND YET IT WAS YOU WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY, IN THE
PAST, THAT AMERICANS WERE ALL COWARDLY."

 

  "THEN I WAS WRONG. I WAS SPEAKING UNFAIRLY AND I ASK ALBERT'S PARDON."

 

  IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT MORRISON CAUGHT KONEV'S EYE. THE MAN WAS
TWISTING AROUND IN HIS SEAT AND GLOWERING AT HIM. MORRISON DID NOT
PRETEND TO BE A MASTER AT READING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, BUT FELT THAT HE
COULD, AT A GLANCE, TELL WHAT WAS AILING KONEV. THE MAN WAS JEALOUS --
FURIOUSLY AND QUITE IMPRESSIVELY JEALOUS.

 

  48.

 

  THE SHIP CONTINUED ITS SLOW WAY ALONG THE CAPILLARY TOWARD THE
DESTINATION KONEV HAD MARKED OUT: THE SKEPTIC NODE. IT WAS NOT DEPENDING
ON THE CURRENT NOW, WHICH WAS SLOW INDEED. THE ENGINES WERE GOING, AS
MORRISON COULD TELL, IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. FIRST, IT STEADIED THE SHIP
TO HAVE IT MOVE ALONG ACTIVELY, RATHER THAN DRIFT PASSIVELY, AND IT
FURTHER DEADENED THE ALREADY SURPRISINGLY SMALL EFFECT OF BROWNIAN
MOTION. SECOND, THE SHIP WAS OVERTAKING ONE RED CORPUSCLE AFTER ANOTHER.

 

  IN MOST CASES THESE WERE NUDGED TO ONE SIDE AND THE RED CORPUSCLES
THEN ROLLED BACKWARD BETWEEN THE SHIP AND THE WALL. OCCASIONALLY, A RED
CORPUSCLE WOULD BE MET TOO NEAR DEAD-CENTER AND IT WOULD THEN BE PUSHED
FORWARD FOR A WHILE UNTIL IT BURST. THE DEBRIS WOULD FLOW BACKWARD,
LEAVING THE SHIP'S HULL UNMARKED. WITH AT LEAST FIVE MILLION CORPUSCLES
IN EVERY CUBIC MILLIMETER OF BLOOD, IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW MANY WERE
DISRUPTED AND MORRISON HAD BECOME HARDENED TO THE CARNAGE.

 

  MORRISON DELIBERATELY THOUGHT OF THE RED CELLS, RATHER THAN OF THE
CHANCE OF SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION. HE KNEW THERE WAS NO
APPRECIABLE CHANCE OF EXPLODING OUTWARD IN THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS AND,
EVEN IF IT HAPPENED, IT WOULD SIMPLY MEAN BLACKOUT. DEATH BY FRIED BRAIN
WOULD TAKE PLACE SO QUICKLY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CONCEIVABLE WAY OF
SENSING IT.

 

  NOT LONG BEFORE, HE HAD BEEN HEATING MUCH MORE SLOWLY IN THE
BLOODSTREAM ITSELF. HE HAD FELT HIMSELF DYING. AFTER THAT, INSTANTANEOUS
DEATH HAD NO TERRORS.

 

  BUT HE PREFERRED TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS JUST THE SAME.

 

  KONEV'S LOOK! WHAT WAS SEETHING WITHIN HIM AND TEARING HIM APART? HE
HAD ABANDONED SOPHIA WITH THE UTMOST CRUELTY. DID HE REALLY THINK THE
CHILD WAS NOT HIS? PEOPLE NEEDED NO REASON TO COME TO AN EMOTIONAL
CONCLUSION AND THE SUSPICION OF BEING WRONG JUST BOLTED THE CONCLUSION
DEFENSIVELY AND IMMOVABLY IN PLACE. PATHOLOGICAL. THINK OF LEONTES IN
THE WINTER'S TALE. SHAKESPEARE ALWAYS GOT THESE THINGS RIGHT. KONEV
WOULD PUSH HER AWAY AND HATE HER FOR THE WRONG HE HAD DONE HER. HE WOULD
PUSH HER INTO ANOTHER MAN'S ARMS AND HATE HER FOR BEING PUSHED -- AND BE
JEALOUS IN ADDITION.

 

  AND SHE? DID SHE KNOW OF THE JEALOUSY AND PLAY UPON IT? WOULD SHE
DELIBERATELY TURN TO MORRISON, AN AMERICAN, TO TEAR KONEV INTO STRIPS?
TENDERLY PATTING THE AMERICAN WITH THE WET TOWEL. DEFENDING HIM AT EVERY
STEP. WITH KONEV, OF COURSE, A WITNESS TO EVERYTHING.

 

  MORRISON'S LIPS TIGHTENED. HE DIDN'T LIKE TO BE A TENNIS BALL, BATTED
FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IN ORDER TO PRODUCE MAXIMUM PAIN.

 

  IT WAS NONE OF HIS BUSINESS, AFTER ALL, AND HE SHOULDN'T TAKE SIDES.
BUT HOW WAS HE GOING TO NOT TAKE SIDES? SOPHIA KALIININ WAS AN
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN WHO REACTED WITH SILENT SORROW. YURI KONEV WAS A
FROWNING NASTY MAN WHO REACTED WITH A COMPRESSED BOILING OF ANGER. HE
COULD NEITHER HELP LIKING SOPHIA NOR HELP DISLIKING YURI.

 

  HE THEN NOTED BORANOVA STARING AT HIM GRAVELY AND WONDERED IF SHE WERE
MISINTERPRETING HIS THOUGHTFULNESS AND SILENCE. DID SHE FEEL HE WAS
BROODING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY MINIATURIZATION -- WHICH HE
WAS MANFULLY TRYING NOT TO DO?

 

  IT SEEMED SO, WHEN BORANOVA SUDDENLY SAID, "ALBERT, NONE OF US ARE
RECKLESS. I HAVE A HUSBAND. I HAVE A SON. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THEM
ALIVE AND I INTEND TO GET US ALL BACK ALIVE. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT."

 

  "I'M SURE YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD," SAID MORRISON, "BUT WHAT CAN YOU
DO AGAINST A POSSIBILITY OF DEMINIATURIZATION THAT IS SPONTANEOUS,
UNPREDICTABLE, UNSTOPPABLE?"

 

  "SPONTANEOUS AND UNPREDICTABLE, I AGREE, BUT WHO SAID UNSTOPPABLE?"

 

  "CAN YOU STOP IT, THEN?"

 

  "I CAN TRY. WE EACH HAVE OUR JOBS HERE. ARKADY MANEUVERS THE SHIP.
YURI DIRECTS IT TO THE DESTINATION. SOPHIA GIVES THE SHIP ITS ELECTRIC
PATTERN. YOU WILL STUDY THE BRAIN WAVES. AS FOR ME, I SIT BACK HERE AND
MAKE DECISIONS -- MY MAJOR DECISION UP TO NOW WAS A MISTAKE, I ADMIT
THAT -- AND I WATCH THE HEAT FLOW."

 

  "THE HEAT FLOW?"

 

  "YES. BEFORE THE DEMINIATURIZATION TAKES PLACE, THERE IS A SMALL
EVOLUTION OF HEAT, CHARACTERISTIC IN PATTERN. IT IS THAT EMISSION THAT
IS DESTABILIZING; IT IS WHAT TIPS THE DELICATE BALANCE AND, AFTER A
SMALL DELAY, STARTS THE PROCESS OF DEMINIATURIZATION. WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
IF I AM FAST ENOUGH, I CAN INTENSIFY THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD IN SUCH A
WAY AS TO REABSORB THE HEAT AND REESTABLISH THE METASTABILITY."

 

  MORRISON SAID DUBIOUSLY, "AND HAS THAT EVER BEEN DONE -- ACTUALLY BEEN
DONE UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS -- OR IS IT SIMPLY THEORY?"

 

  "IT HAS BEEN DONE -- UNDER MUCH SMALLER INTENSITIES OF
MINIATURIZATION, OF COURSE. STILL, I HAVE TRAINED AT THIS AND MY
REFLEXES ARE SHARPENED. I HOPE NOT TO BE CAUGHT SHORT."

 

  "WAS IT SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION THAT PUT SHAPIROV INTO A COMA,
NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA HESITATED. "WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER IT WAS AN
UNFORTUNATE ENCOUNTER WITH THE LAWS OF NATURE OR HUMAN ERROR -- OR BOTH.
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A SLIGHTLY GREATER WOBBLE FROM THE METASTABLE POINT OF
EQUILIBRIUM THAN USUAL AND NOTHING MORE THAN THAT. IT IS NOT SOMETHING I
CAN ANALYZE IN DETAIL WITH YOU, FOR YOU DON'T HAVE THE NEEDED BACKGROUND
IN THE PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS OF MINIATURIZATION, NOR WOULD I BE
PERMITTED TO GIVE YOU THAT

 

  BACKGROUND."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND. CLASSIFIED MATERIAL."

 

  "OF COURSE."

 

  DEZHNEV BROKE IN, "NATASHA, WE HAVE REACHED THE SKEPTIC NODE -- OR SO
YURI SAYS."

 

  "THEN COME TO A HALT," ORDERED BORANOVA.

 

  49.

 

  COMING TO A HALT TOOK A WHILE.

 

  MORRISON NOTED, WITH SOME MILD SURPRISE, THAT DEZHNEV DID NOT SEEM
CONCERNED IN THE PROCESS. HE WAS CHECKING HIS INSTRUMENTS BUT WAS MAKING
NO EFFORT TO CONTROL THE MOTION OF THE SHIP.

 

  IT WAS KALIININ WHO WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED NOW. MORRISON LOOKED TO HIS
LEFT, STUDYING HER AS SHE BENT OVER HER INSTRUMENT, HER HAIR FAILING
FORWARD BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH TO GET IN HER WAY, HER EYES INTENT, HER SLIM
FINGERS CARESSING THE KEYS OF HER COMPUTER. THE GRAPHIC PATTERNS ON THE
SCREEN SHE WAS WATCHING MADE NO SENSE TO MORRISON, OF COURSE.

 

  "ARKADY," SHE SAID, "MOVE FORWARD JUST A LITTLE."

 

  THE FEEBLE CURRENT IN THE CAPILLARIES BARELY STIRRED THE SHIP. DEZHNEV
SUPPLIED A SMALL BURST OF POWER. (MORRISON FELT HIS ALMOST MASSLESS BODY
MOVE SLIGHTLY BACKWARD, SINCE THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT INERTIA TO GIVE IT
A REAL JERK.) THE NEAREST RED CORPUSCLES BETWEEN THE SHIP AND THE
FARTHER WALL OF THE CAPILLARY DRIFTED BACKWARD.

 

  "STOP, STOP," SAID KALIININ. "ENOUGH."

 

  "I CAN'T STOP," SAID DEZHNEV. "I CAN ONLY CUT THE MOTORS AND THAT I'VE
DONE."

 

  "IT'S ALL RIGHT," SAID KALIININ. "I HAVE IT NOW," THEN ADDED THE
ALL-BUT-INEVITABLE SAVING AFTERTHOUGHT OF "I THINK." THEN: "YES, I DO
HAVE IT."

 

  MORRISON FELT HIMSELF SWAY FORWARD VERY SLIGHTLY. THEN HE NOTED THE
NEARBY RED CORPUSCLES, TOGETHER WITH AN OCCASIONAL PLATELET, DRIFT
FORWARD AND PASS BY LAZILY.

 

  IN ADDITION, HE BECAME AWARE OF A TOTAL CESSATION OF THE BROWNIAN
MOTION, THAT FAINT TREMBLE HE HAD GROWN SO USED TO THAT HE WAS ABLE TO
IGNORE IT -- UNTIL IT STOPPED. NOW ITS ABSENCE WAS NOTICEABLE AND IT
PRODUCED THE SAME SENSATION WITHIN MORRISON AS THE SUDDEN CESSATION OF A
CONTINUOUS LOW HUM WOULD HAVE. HE STIRRED UNEASILY. IT WAS AS THOUGH HIS
HEART HAD STOPPED, EVEN THOUGH INTELLECTUALLY HE KNEW IT HAD NOT.

 

  HE ASKED, "WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE BROWNIAN MOTION, SOPHIA?"

 

  SHE REPLIED, "WE'RE AFFIXED TO THE WALL OF THE CAPILLARY, ALBERT."

 

  MORRISON NODDED. IF THE SHIP WAS ONE PIECE WITH THE CAPILLARY WALL, SO
TO SPEAK, THE BOMBARDING WATER MOLECULES THAT PRODUCED THE BROWNIAN
MOTION WOULD LOSE THEIR EFFECT. THEIR IMPACTS WOULD WORK TOWARD MOVING
AN ENTIRE SECTION OF COMPARATIVELY INERT WALL, INSTEAD OF A TINY SHIP
THE SIZE OF A BLOOD PLATELET. NATURALLY, THE TREMBLING WOULD CEASE.

 

  "HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO AFFIX THE SHIP, SOPHIA?" HE ASKED.

 

  "THE USUAL ELECTRICAL FORCES. THE CAPILLARY WALL IS PARTLY PROTEIN,
PARTLY PHOSPHOLIPID IN CHARACTER. THERE ARE POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY
CHARGED GROUPS HERE AND THERE. I HAD TO DETECT A PATTERN SUFFICIENTLY
COMPACT, AND THEN PRODUCE A COMPLEMENTARY PATTERN ON THE SHIP; NEGATIVE
WHERE THE WALL IS POSITIVE AND VICE VERSA. THE TROUBLE IS THAT THE SHIP
IS MOVING WITH THE CURRENT, SO THAT I HAVE TO DETECT IT A LITTLE AHEAD
AND PRODUCE THE COMPLEMENTARY PATTERN BEFORE WE PASS IT. I MISSED THREE
SUCH OCCASIONS AND THEN WE HIT A REGION WHERE THERE WERE NO SUITABLE
PATTERNS AT ALL, SO I HAD TO GET ARKADY TO MOVE US AHEAD A BIT INTO A
BETTER REGION. -- BUT I MADE IT."

 

  "IF THE SHIP HAD A REVERSE GEAR," SAID MORRISON, "THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN NO PROBLEM, WOULD THERE?"

 

  "TRUE," SAID KALIININ, "AND THE NEXT SHIP WILL HAVE ONE. BUT FOR NOW,
WE HAVE ONLY WHAT WE HAVE."

 

  "QUITE SO," PUT IN DEZHNEV. "AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'ON TOMORROW'S
FEAST, WE CAN STARVE TODAY.'"

 

  "ON THE OTHER HAND," SAID KALIININ, "IF WE HAD A MOTOR THAT COULD DO
ALL WE WOULD WANT IT TO DO, WE WOULD HAVE A STRONG IMPULSE TO USE IT
LAVISHLY AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO GOOD FOR POOR SHAPIROV. AND IT WOULD
BE EXPENSIVE BESIDES. AS IT IS, WE USED AN ELECTRIC FIELD WHICH IS MORE
SPARING OF ENERGY THAN A MOTOR WOULD BE AND THE PRICE IS ONLY A LITTLE
MORE WORK FOR ME -- AND WHAT OF THAT?"

 

  MORRISON WAS QUITE CERTAIN SHE WASN'T TALKING FOR HIS BENEFIT. HE
SAID, "ARE YOU ALWAYS SO PHILOSOPHICAL?"

 

  FOR A MOMENT, HER EYES WIDENED AND HER NOSTRILS TIGHTENED, BUT ONLY
FOR A MOMENT. THEN SHE RELAXED AND SAID WITH A SMALL SMILE, "NO, WHO
COULD BE? BUT I TRY."

 

  BORANOVA INTERJECTED, IMPATIENTLY, "ENOUGH CHAT, SOPHIA. -- ARKADY,
YOU ARE CLEARLY IN TOUCH WITH THE GROTTO. WHAT'S THE DELAY?"

 

  ARKADY HELD UP A LARGE HAND, HALF-TWISTING IN HIS SEAT TO PRESENT ITS
PALM TOWARD BORANOVA. "PATIENCE, MY CAPTAIN. THEY WANT US TO STAY
EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, I'M SENDING OUT A CARRIER
WAVE IN THREE DIRECTIONS. THEY ARE LOCATING EACH AND USING THEM TO
LOCATE US IN ORDER TO SEE IF THE LOCATION THEY DETERMINE JIBES WITH WHAT
YURI SAYS IT IS BY DEAD RECKONING."

 

  "HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?"

 

  "WHO CAN SAY? A FEW MINUTES, AT ANY RATE. BUT THEN MY CARRIER WAVES
ARE NOT VERY INTENSE AND THE LOCATION MUST BE PRECISE, SO THEY MAY HAVE
TO REPEAT THE MEASUREMENT SEVERAL TIMES AND TAKE A MEAN AND CALCULATE
LIMITS OF ERROR. AFTER ALL, THEY HAVE TO BE CORRECT, FOR AS MY FATHER
USED TO SAY: 'ALMOST RIGHT IS NO BETTER THAN WRONG.'"

 

  "YES YES, ARKADY, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM. WHAT
IS THE SECOND REASON WE ARE WAITING?"

 

  "THEY'RE GOING THROUGH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON PYOTR SHAPIROV. HIS
HEARTBEAT HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY IRREGULAR."

 

  KONEV LOOKED UP, HIS MOUTH FAILING OPEN SLIGHTLY AND HIS THIN CHEEKS
LOOKING GAUNT UNDER HIS HIGH CHEEKBONES. "WHAT! DO THEY SAY IT'S
ANYTHING WE'RE DOING?"

 

  "NO," SAID DEZHNEV. "DO NOT BECOME A TRAGEDIAN. THEY SAY NOTHING OF
THE SORT. AND WHAT CAN WE BE DOING TO SHAPIROV THAT IS OF ANY
IMPORTANCE? WE ARE MERELY A RED CORPUSCLE AMONG RED CORPUSCLES IN HIS
BLOODSTREAM, ONE AMONG TRILLIONS."

 

  "WELL, THEN, WHAT'S WRONG?"

 

  "DO I KNOW?" SAID DEZHNEV, CLEARLY IRRITATED. "DO THEY TELL ME? AM I A
PHYSICIAN? I JUST MANEUVER THIS VESSEL AND THEY PAY ME NO MIND EXCEPT AS
A PAIR OF HANDS ON THE CONTROLS."

 

  KALIININ SAID WITH A TOUCH OF SADNESS, "ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV CLINGS
BUT WEAKLY TO LIFE IN ANY CASE. IT IS A WONDER THAT HE HAS REMAINED IN
STABLE CONDITION SO LONG."

 

  BORANOVA NODDED. "YOU ARE RIGHT, SOPHIA."

 

  KONEV SAID SAVAGELY, "BUT HE MUST CONTINUE TO REMAIN SO. HE CAN'T LET
GO NOW. NOT NOW. WE HAVEN'T MADE OUR MEASUREMENTS YET."

 

  "WE WILL MAKE THEM," SAID BORANOVA. "AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT IS NOT THE
END OF THE WORLD, EVEN FOR A MAN IN A COMA."

 

  KONEV POUNDED THE ARM OF HIS SEAT WITH A CLENCHED FIST. "I WILL NOT
LOSE A MOMENT. ALBERT, LET'S BEGIN."

 

  MORRISON WAS STARTLED. HE SAID, "WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE IN THE
BLOODSTREAM?"

 

  "A NEURAL EFFECT MAY BE FELT IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE NERVE CELL."

 

  "SURELY NOT. WHY WOULD THE NEURONS HAVE AXONS AND DENDRITES TO CHANNEL
THE IMPULSE IF IT WAS GOING TO SPREAD AND WEAKEN INTO SPACE BEYOND?
LOCOMOTIVES MOVE ALONG RAILS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES ALONG WIRES, NEURAL
IMPULSES --"

 

  "DON'T ARGUE THE CASE, ALBERT. LET'S NOT ACCEPT FAILURE BY SOME FINE
PROCESS OF REASONING. LET'S TEST THE MATTER. SEE IF YOU CAN DETECT BRAIN
WAVES AND IF YOU CAN ANALYZE THEM IN THE PROPER FASHION."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I'LL TRY, BUT DON'T ORDER ME AROUND IN THAT BULLYING
TONE."

 

  "I'M SORRY," SAID KONEV, NOT SOUNDING SORRY AT ALL. "I WANT TO WATCH
WHAT YOU DO." HE UNCLASPED HIMSELF, TURNED IN HIS SEAT, HOLDING ON
TIGHTLY, MUTTERING, "WE MUST HAVE MORE ROOM THE NEXT TIME."

 

  "AN OCEAN LINER, CERTAINLY," SAID DEZHNEV. "NEXT TIME."

 

  "WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FIRST," SAID MORRISON, "IS TO DISCOVER WHETHER WE
CAN DETECT ANYTHING AT ALL. THE TROUBLE IS, WE ARE SURROUNDED BY
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS. THE MUSCLES ARE RICH IN THEM AND EACH MOLECULE,
ALMOST, IS THE ORIGIN POINT OF A --"

 

  "TAKE ALL THAT AS KNOWN," SAID KONEV.

 

  "I AM ONLY FILLING IN THE TIME WHILE I CARRY MY DEVICE THROUGH SOME
NECESSARY STEPS. THE NEURAL FIELD IS CHARACTERISTIC IN SEVERAL WAYS AND
BY ADJUSTING THE COMPUTER TO ELIMINATE FIELDS WITHOUT THOSE
CHARACTERISTICS, I LEAVE ONLY WHAT THE NEURONS PRODUCE. WE BLANK OUT ALL
MICROFIELDS LIKE SO AND WE DEFLECT THE MUSCLE FIELDS IN THIS MANNER --"

 

  "IN WHAT MANNER?" DEMANDED KONEV.

 

  "I DESCRIBE IT IN MY PAPERS."

 

  "BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHAT YOU DID."

 

  WORDLESSLY, MORRISON REPEATED THE MANEUVER SLOWLY.

 

  "OH," SAID KONEV.

 

  "AND BY NOW WE SHOULD BE DETECTING ONLY NEURAL WAVES IF ANY ARE
PRESENT HERE TO DETECT -- AND THERE AREN'T."

 

  KONEV'S RIGHT FIST CLENCHED. "ARE YOU SURE?"

 

  "THE SCREEN SHOWS A HORIZONTAL LINE. NOTHING ELSE."

 

  "IT'S QUIVERING."

 

  "NOISE. POSSIBLY FROM THE SHIP'S OWN ELECTRIC FIELD, WHICH IS COMPLEX
AND NOT ENTIRELY LIKE ANY OF THE NATURAL FIELDS OF THE BODY. I'VE NEVER
HAD TO ADJUST A COMPUTER TO FILTER OUT AN ARTIFICIAL FIELD."

 

  "WELL, THEN, WE HAVE TO MOVE ON. -- ARKADY, TELL THEM WE CAN WAIT NO
LONGER."

 

  "I CAN'T DO THAT, YURI, UNLESS NATASHA TELLS ME TO. SHE'S THE CAPTAIN.
OR HAD YOU FORGOTTEN?"

 

  "THANK YOU, ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA COLDLY. "YOU, AT LEAST, HAVE NOT.
WE'LL FORGIVE KONEV HIS LAPSE AND PUT IT DOWN TO OVERZEALOUSNESS IN
PURSUIT OF HIS WORK. MY ORDERS ARE NOT TO MOVE UNTIL THE GROTTO GIVES US
THE WORD. IF THIS MISSION FAILS BECAUSE OF ANYTHING THAT GOES WRONG WITH
SHAPIROV, THERE MUST BE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE TO SAY IT WAS BECAUSE
WE DID NOT FOLLOW ORDERS."

 

  "WHAT IF SOME DISASTER HAPPENS BECAUSE WE DID FOLLOW ORDERS? THAT CAN
HAPPEN, TOO, YOU KNOW." KONEV'S VOICE ROSE TO NEAR-HYSTERIA.

 

  BORANOVA REPLIED, "THE FAULT WILL THEN LIE WITH THOSE WHO GAVE THE
ORDERS."

 

  "I CAN FIND NO SATISFACTION IN APPORTIONING BLAME, WHETHER TO MYSELF
OR TO ANYONE ELSE. IT IS RESULTS THAT COUNT," SAID KONEV.

 

  "I AGREE," SAID BORANOVA, "IF WE ARE DEALING WITH FINESPUN THEORY. BUT
IF YOU EXPECT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS PROJECT PAST THE TIME OF A
POSSIBLE CATASTROPHE, YOU WILL FIND THAT THE MANNER OF ALLOTTING BLAME
IS ALL-IMPORTANT."

 

  "WELL, THEN," SAID KONEV, STUTTERING SLIGHTLY IN HIS PASSION. "URGE
THEM TO LET US MOVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE'LL -- WE'LL --"

 

  "YES?" SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "AND THEN WE'LL ENTER THE CELL. WE MUST."

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 12 -- INTERCELLULAR

 

  IN LIFE, UNLIKE CHESS, THE GAME CONTINUES AFTER CHECKMATE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  50.

 

  A HEAVY SILENCE FELL UPON THE FIVE SHIPMATES. KONEV'S SILENCE WAS THE
LEAST QUIET. HE WAS QUIVERING WITH UNREST AND HIS HANDS WOULD NOT KEEP
STILL.

 

  MORRISON FELT A DIM SYMPATHY. TO HAVE REACHED THE DESTINATION, TO HAVE
DONE JUST AS PLANNED, THROUGH DIFFICULTIES, TO IMAGINE ONE'S SELF AT THE
POINT OF SNATCHING SUCCESS, AND TO HAVE TO FEAR THAT IT WILL BE MOVED
AWAY FROM THE EAGERLY GRASPING FINGERS EVEN NOW -- HE KNEW THE FEELING.
NO LONGER QUITE AS SHARPLY PERHAPS, AS ONCE, NOW THAT HE WAS GROUND DOWN
AND DULLED BY FRUSTRATION, BUT HE REMEMBERED THE EARLY OCCASIONS.
EXPERIMENTS THAT RAISED HOPE, BUT WERE SOMEHOW NEVER QUITE CONCLUSIVE.
COLLEAGUES WHO SMILED AND NODDED, BUT WERE NEVER CONVINCED.

 

  HE LEANED FORWARD AND SAID, "LOOK, YURI, JUST WATCH THE RED
CORPUSCLES. THEY'RE CREEPING AHEAD, ONE AFTER THE OTHER, STEADILY -- AND
THAT MEANS THE HEART IS BEATING AND IS DOING SO FAIRLY NORMALLY. AS LONG
AS THE RED CORPUSCLES MOVE STEADILY AHEAD, WE'RE SAFE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "THERE'S THE BLOOD TEMPERATURE, TOO. I'VE GOT IT
MONITORED AT ALL TIMES AND IT WILL HAVE TO START DROPPING SLOWLY, BUT
WITH DETERMINATION, IF SHAPIROV LETS GO. ACTUALLY, THE TEMPERATURE IS AT
THE UPPER EDGE OF NORMAL."

 

  KONEV GRUNTED, AS THOUGH SCORNING CONSOLATION AND PUSHING IT TO ONE
SIDE, BUT IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT HE WAS NOTICEABLY QUIETER AFTER
THAT.

 

  MORRISON SANK BACK IN HIS SEAT AND LET HIS EYES CLOSE. HE WONDERED IF
HE WAS EXPERIENCING HUNGER AND DECIDED THAT HE WAS NOT. HE ALSO WONDERED
IF THERE WAS A DISTINCT SENSATION OF BLADDER PRESSURE. THERE WASN'T BUT
THAT DID NOT RELIEVE HIM MUCH. ONE COULD ALWAYS POSTPONE EATING FOR A
CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME, BUT THE NECESSITY OF URINATION DID NOT LEND
ITSELF TO QUITE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY OF CHOICE.

 

  HE WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT KALIININ HAD ADDRESSED HIM BUT HE HAD NOT
BEEN LISTENING. "PARDON ME. WHAT DID YOU SAY?" HE ASKED, TURNING TOWARD
HER.

 

  KALFININ LOOKED SURPRISED. SHE SAID SOFTLY, "I ASK YOUR PARDON. I
INTERRUPTED YOUR THOUGHTS."

 

  "THEY WERE WORTH INTERRUPTING, SOPHIA. I ASK YOUR PARDON FOR BEING
INATTENTIVE."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, I ASKED WHAT IT IS YOU DO IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF BRAIN
WAVES. I MEAN, WHAT IS IT YOU DO THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT OTHERS DO?
WHY WAS IT NECESSARY FOR US --" SHE PAUSED, CLEARLY UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW
TO PROCEED.

 

  MORRISON FINISHED HER THOUGHT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. "WHY WAS IT
NECESSARY FOR ME TO BE ABSTRACTED FORCIBLY FROM MY COUNTRY?"

 

  "HAVE I MADE YOU ANGRY?"

 

  "NO. I PRESUME YOU DID NOT ADVISE THE ACTION."

 

  "OF COURSE NOT. I KNEW NOTHING OF IT. IN FACT, THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING
YOU MY QUESTION. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOUR FIELD EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE
ELECTRONEURAL WAVES; THAT ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY HAS BECOME AN INTRICATE
STUDY, AND AN IMPORTANT ONE."

 

  "THEN IF YOU ASK ME WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT MY OWN VIEWS, I'M AFRAID I
CAN'T TELL YOU."

 

  "IS IT SECRET, THEN? I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE."

 

  "NO, IT IS NOT SECRET," SAID MORRISON, FROWNING. "THERE ARE NO SECRETS
IN SCIENCE, OR THERE SHOULD BE NONE -- EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE STRUGGLES
FOR PRIORITY SO THAT SCIENTISTS ARE SOMETIMES CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY
SAY, AND I AM GUILTY OF THAT, TOO, SOMETIMES. IN THIS CASE, THOUGH, I
MEAN IT LITERALLY. I CAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE YOU LACK THE BASIS FOR
UNDERSTANDING."

 

  KALIININ CONSIDERED, HER LIPS COMPRESSED AS THOUGH IN AID TO THOUGHT.
"COULD YOU EXPLAIN A BIT OF IT?"

 

  "I CAN TRY, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO HEAR SIMPLE ASSERTIONS. I CAN'T VERY
WELL DESCRIBE THE ENTIRE FIELD. -- WHAT WE CALL BRAIN WAVES ARE A
CONGLOMERATION OF ALL SORTS OF NEURONIC ACTIVITY -- SENSE PERCEPTIONS OF
VARIOUS KINDS, STIMULI OF VARIOUS MUSCLES AND GLANDS, AROUSAL
MECHANISMS, COORDINATIONS, AND SO ON. LOST AMONG ALL THESE ARE THOSE
WAVES THAT CONTROL, OR RESULT FROM, CONSTRUCTIVE AND CREATIVE THOUGHT.
ISOLATING THOSE SKEPTIC WAVES, AS I CALL THEM, FROM ALL THE REST IS AN
ENORMOUS PROBLEM. THE BODY DOES IT WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY, BUT WE POOR
SCIENTISTS ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, AT A TOTAL LOSS."

 

  "I'M HAVING NO DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THIS," SAID KALIININ, SMILING
AND LOOKING PLEASED. (SHE IS REMARKABLY PRETTY, THOUGHT MORRISON, WHEN
SHE MANAGES TO GET RID OF HER AIR OF MELANCHOLY.)

 

  "I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE HARD PART YET," HE SAID.

 

  "PLEASE DO, THEN."

 

  "ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE WAS WHAT
SEEMED A RANDOM COMPONENT IN THE WAVES THAT NO ONE HAD EVER PICKED UP
BECAUSE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT HAD BEEN USED UNTIL THEN DID NOT PICK UP
WHAT WE NOW CALL 'THE TWINKLE.' IT'S A VERY RAPID OSCILLATION OF
IRREGULAR AMPLITUDE AND INTENSITY. THAT'S NOT A DISCOVERY I MADE, YOU
UNDERSTAND."

 

  KALIININ SMILED AGAIN. "I IMAGINE THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOO YOUNG TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY."

 

  "I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE THEN, MAKING THE DISCOVERY THAT YOUNG WOMEN
WERE NOT ENTIRELY UNAPPROACHABLE, WHICH IS BY NO MEANS AN UNIMPORTANT
THING TO FIND OUT. IN FACT, EACH PERSON MAY HAVE TO REDISCOVER IT NOW
AND THEN, I THINK. -- BUT NEVER MIND THAT.

 

  "A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SPECULATED THAT THE TWINKLE MIGHT REPRESENT
THOUGHT PROCESSES IN THE MIND, BUT NO ONE MANAGED TO ISOLATE IT
PROPERLY. IT WOULD COME AND GO, BE DETECTABLE AT TIMES AND NOT AT
OTHERS, AND THE GENERAL FEELING WAS THAT IT WAS ARTIFACTITIOUS, A MATTER
OF WORKING WITH INSTRUMENTS THAT WERE TOO DELICATE FOR THE THING THEY
WERE MEASURING SO THAT ONE PICKED UP WHAT WAS, ESSENTIALLY, NOISE.

 

  "I THOUGHT NOT. IN TIME I DEVELOPED A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT MADE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO ISOLATE THE TWINKLE AND TO DEMONSTRATE IT WAS ALWAYS
PRESENT IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. FOR THAT I GOT SOME CREDIT, THOUGH FEW
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE MY WORK. I USED ANIMALS FOR TYPES OF
EXPERIMENTATION THAT WERE TOO DANGEROUS TO PERFORM ON HUMAN BEINGS AND
USED THE RESULTS TO FURTHER SHARPEN MY PROGRAM OF ANALYSIS. BUT THE
SHARPER I MADE THE ANALYSIS AND THE MORE SIGNIFICANT I THOUGHT THE
RESULTS, THE LESS OTHERS WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE THEM AND THE MORE THEY
INSISTED THAT I WAS MISLED BY MY ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION.

 

  "BUT EVEN ISOLATING THE TWINKLE WAS A LONG WAY FROM DEMONSTRATING THAT
IT WAS A REPRESENTATION OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT. I HAVE AMPLIFIED IT,
INTENSIFIED IT, MODIFIED MY PROGRAM OVER AND OVER, AND HAVE CONVINCED
MYSELF THAT I AM STUDYING THOUGHT, THE SKEPTIC WAVES THEMSELVES. STILL,
NO ONE CAN DUPLICATE THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF MY WORK. I HAVE, ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS, ALLOWED SOMEONE TO USE MY PROGRAM AND MY COMPUTER -- THE SORT
OF THING I'M USING NOW -- AND THEY INVARIABLY FAIL."

 

  KALIININ WAS LISTENING GRAVELY. SHE SAID, "CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY NO ONE
CAN DUPLICATE YOUR WORK?"

 

  "THE EASIEST EXPLANATION IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME,
THAT I AM A CRANK -- IF NOT A MADMAN. I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF MY
COLLEAGUES SUSPECT THAT TO BE THE ANSWER."

 

  "DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A MADMAN?"

 

  "NO, I DON'T, SOPHIA, BUT EVEN I WAVER SOMETIMES. YOU SEE, AFTER YOU
ISOLATE THE SKEPTIC WAVES AND AMPLIFY THEM, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE
HUMAN BRAIN ITSELF MIGHT BECOME A RECEIVING INSTRUMENT. THE WAVES MAY
TRANSFER THE THOUGHTS FROM THE THINKER YOU ARE STUDYING DIRECTLY TO YOU.
THE BRAIN WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY DELICATE RECEIVER, BUT
IT WOULD ALSO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY INDIVIDUAL ONE. IF I IMPROVED MY
PROGRAM SO THAT I COULD SENSE THE THOUGHTS BETTER, THAT WOULD MEAN I
IMPROVED IT TO SUIT MY OWN INDIVIDUAL BRAIN. OTHER BRAINS MIGHT NOT BE
AFFECTED AND, IN FACT, MIGHT BE LESS AFFECTED, THE CLOSER I ADJUSTED IT
TO MINE. IT WOULD BE LIKE A PAINTING. THE CLOSER A PAINTING IS MADE TO
LOOK LIKE ME, THE LESS IT LOOKS LIKE ANYONE ELSE. THE MORE I CAN MAKE MY
PROGRAM PRODUCE SENSIBLE SELF-CONSISTENT RESULTS, THE LESS ANYONE ELSE
CAN."

 

  "HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SENSED THOUGHT?"

 

  "I'M NOT SURE. THERE ARE TIMES I HAVE THOUGHT I DID, BUT I'M NEVER
QUITE CONVINCED IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION. CERTAINLY NO ONE ELSE -- WITH
MY PROGRAM OR ANY OTHER -- HAS SENSED ANYTHING. I HAVE USED THE TWINKLE
TO TRACK DOWN THE SKEPTIC NODES IN THE BRAINS OF CHIMPANZEES AND FROM
THAT REASONED OUT WHERE THEY WOULD BE IN HUMAN BRAINS, BUT THAT IS NOT
ACCEPTED EITHER. IT IS CONSIDERED THE OVERENTHUSIASM OF A SCIENTIST
OVERSOLD ON HIS OWN UNLIKELY THEORY. AND EVEN USING LEADS INTO THE
SKEPTIC NODES -- ON ANIMALS, OF COURSE -- I COULDN'T BE SURE."

 

  "WITH ANIMALS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT. HAVE YOU PUBLISHED THESE --
SENSATIONS OF YOURS?"

 

  "I HAVEN'T DARED," SAID MORRISON, SHAKING HIS HEAD. "NO ONE WOULD
ACCEPT SUCH SUBJECTIVE FINDINGS. I'VE MENTIONED IT IN PASSING TO SEVERAL
PEOPLE -- FOOLISH OF ME -- AND THE NEWS SPREAD AND MERELY CONVINCED MY
COLLEAGUES ALL THE MORE FIRMLY THAT I AM, SHALL WE SAY, UNSTABLE. IT WAS
ONLY LAST SUNDAY THAT NATALYA TOLD ME THAT SHAPIROV TOOK ME SERIOUSLY,
BUT HE IS CONSIDERED, AT LEAST IN MY COUNTRY, TO BE UNSTABLE, TOO."

 

  "HE IS NOT," SAID KALIININ FIRMLY, "OR WAS NOT."

 

  "IT WOULD BE NICE TO THINK HE WASN'T, OBVIOUSLY."

 

  KONEV, FROM IN FRONT OF MORRISON, SAID SUDDENLY, WITHOUT TURNING
AROUND, "IT WAS YOUR SENSATIONS OF THOUGHT THAT IMPRESSED SHAPIROV. I
KNOW! HE DISCUSSED IT WITH ME. HE SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THAT
YOUR PROGRAM WAS A RELAY STATION AND HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT HIMSELF. IF
YOU WERE INSIDE A NEURON, A KEY NEURON OF THE SKEPTIC NODE, THINGS WOULD
BE DIFFERENT. YOU WOULD SENSE THOUGHTS UNMISTAKABLY. SHAPIROV THOUGHT SO
AND I THINK SO. SHAPIROV THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE SENSED
THOUGHTS UNMISTAKABLY AS IT WAS, BUT WERE NOT READY TO LET THE WORLD
KNOW. IS THAT SO?"

 

  HOW THEY HARPED ON SECRECY, ALL OF THEM, THOUGHT MORRISON. THEN HE
CAUGHT THE LOOK ON KALIININ'S FACE. HER MOUTH WAS PARTLY OPEN, HER
EYEBROWS DRAWN TOGETHER, HER FINGER HOVERING NEAR HER LIPS. IT WAS AS
THOUGH SHE WANTED TO ASK HIM TO BE QUIET WITH A KIND OF AGONIZING
INTENSITY, WITHOUT QUITE DARING TO DO SO OPENLY.

 

  BUT THEN HE WAS DISTRACTED BY DEZHNEV'S VOICE, JOYFULLY LOUD. "ENOUGH
BABBLE, MY CHILDREN. THE GROTTO HAS LOCATED US AND WE ARE, TO THEIR
ENORMOUS ASTONISHMENT, EXACTLY WHERE WE SAY WE ARE."

 

  KONEV THREW UP BOTH HANDS AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED ALMOST BOYISH.
"EXACTLY WHERE I SAY WE ARE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "LET US HAVE COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHERE WE SAY WE
ARE."

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA. "I ORDERED KONEV TO MAKE THE DECISION ON HIS OWN
RESPONSIBILITY. THE CREDIT IS THEREFORE HIS."

 

  KONEV WAS NOT MOLLIFIED. HE SAID, "YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SO QUICKLY
DEMANDED COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY, ARKADY VISSARIONOVICH" -- HE USED THE
PATRONYMIC IN A STYLE LONG OUT OF FASHION IN THE SOVIET UNION, AS THOUGH
TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT DEZHNEV WAS THE SON OF A PEASANT, AMONG WHOM,
ONLY, THE STYLE REMAINED IN FASHION -- "HAD WE PROVED TO BE IN THE WRONG
CAPILLARY."

 

  DEZHNEV'S SMILE BECAME AN UNCOMFORTABLE ONE AND HIS SOMEWHAT YELLOW
UPPER INCISORS CAUGHT AT HIS LOWER LIP.

 

  BORANOVA SAID IN HER MASTERFUL CONTRALTO, CUTTING OFF ANY RETORT
DEZHNEV MIGHT HAVE MADE, "AND SHAPIROV. WHAT OF HIM?"

 

  "THAT," SAID DEZHNEV, "HAS PASSED. AN INJECTION OF SOME SORT STEADIED
THE HEARTBEAT."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WELL, THEN, ARE WE READY TO GO?"

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "IN THAT CASE -- OUT OF THE BLOODSTREAM AT LAST."

 

  51.

 

  BORANOVA AND KALIININ WERE BENT OVER THEIR INSTRUMENTS. MORRISON
WATCHED THEM FOR A FEW MOMENTS, BUT, OF COURSE, KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS
GOING ON. HE TURNED TO DEZHNEV, WHO SAT IN A RELAXED POSITION (UNLIKE
KONEV, WHOSE BODY WAS TENSE, ALMOST RIDGED WITH MUSCLE), AND SAID, "WHAT
WILL BE DONE, ARKADY? WE CAN'T VERY WELL JUST BLAST OUR WAY OUT OF A
BLOOD VESSEL IN THE BRAIN."

 

  "WE'LL SNEAK OUT ONCE WE'RE SMALL ENOUGH. WE'RE MINIATURIZING AGAIN.
LOOK AROUND YOU."

 

  STARTLED, MORRISON DID. HE REALIZED THAT EVERY TIME THE OUTSIDE WORLD
SEEMED TO STABILIZE, HE QUICKLY LEARNED TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND TO
PAY NO ATTENTION TO IT.

 

  THE CURRENT HAD PICKED UP SPEED. OR, RATHER, IT HADN'T, BUT THE SHIP
HAD SHRUNK IN SIZE ONCE MORE AND OBJECTS MOVING BY TOOK CORRESPONDINGLY
LESS TIME TO PASS, SO THAT THE MIND, INSISTING ON CONSIDERING THE SHIP'S
SIZE UNCHANGED, INTERPRETED WHAT WAS SEEN AS A FASTER CURRENT.

 

  A RED CELL PASSED BY, MOVING AS IT HAD (OR SEEMING TO MOVE AS IT HAD)
IN THE CAROTID ARTERY, BUT DESPITE ITS SPEED, IT BILLOWED PAST FOR A
LONG TIME, LIKE A QUIVERING WHALE PASSING A ROWBOAT. IT HAD GROWN FAINT
INDEED. IT WAS ALMOST TRANSPARENT NOW AND ITS EDGE WAS FUZZY WITH
BROWNIAN MOTION. THERE WAS A GRAYISH DIMNESS ABOUT IT, SO THAT IT LOOKED
LIKE AN ANGRY THUNDERCLOUD SPREADING ITS WAY OVER THE HEAVENS. IT HAD
LOST MOST OF ITS OXYGEN BY THIS TIME, OF COURSE, GIVING IT UP TO THE
AVID BRAIN CELLS WHICH, WITHOUT MOTION OR VISIBLE SIGNS OF LIFE,
CONSUMED ONE QUARTER OF ALL THE OXYGEN CARRIED BY THE BLOOD TO THE
VARIOUS ORGANS OF THE BODY. FOR ALL THAT THE BRAIN SEEMED TO SIMPLY SIT
THERE, SENSE PERCEPTION, RESPONSE, AND THOUGHT, ALL OF IT COORDINATED
WITH A COMPLEXITY THAT NO HUMAN COMPUTER COULD COME WITHIN AN
ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCE OF DUPLICATION -- MIGHT NEVER DUPLICATE -- DID NOT
COME CHEAP.

 

  TO MAKE UP FOR THE SPREADING OF THE RED CELLS, THE PLATELETS, AND THE
COMPARATIVELY RARE WHITE CELLS THAT HAD GROWN INTO MONSTERS THAT WERE
NOW TOO LARGE TO GRASP, THE BLOOD PLASMA WAS BECOMING FAR LESS
FEATURELESSLY LIQUID.

 

  IT HAD STARTED TO TURN GRAINY AND NOW THE GRAINS WERE SLOWLY EXPANDING
AS THEY SHOT PAST WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING SPEED. MORRISON KNEW HE WAS
LOOKING AT PROTEIN MOLECULES AND, AFTER A WHILE, IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
THROUGH THEIR WHIRLING AND FLEXING HE COULD MAKE OUT THE HELICAL
ARRANGEMENTS OF THEIR ATOMS IN FUZZY MANNER. SOME HAD A MINIATURE FOREST
OF LIPID MOLECULES PARTIALLY ENCASING THEM.

 

  HE WAS BECOMING AWARE ALSO OF MOVEMENT, NOT THE TREMBLE OF BROWNIAN
MOTION BUT A LURCHING THAT WAS BECOMING MORE PRONOUNCED.

 

  HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK OUT THE OTHER SIDE AT THE CAPILLARY WALL TO
WHICH THEY WERE ATTACHED.

 

  THE TILING WAS GONE -- OR AT LEAST ONE TILE (OR CELL, AS HE MIGHT AS
WELL THINK OF IT NOW) HAD EXPANDED TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS THE ONLY
ONE TO BE SEEN. SLIPPING OFF BEHIND WAS THE BULGE OF THE NUCLEUS OF THE
CELL, LARGE AND THICK AND GROWING LARGER AND THICKER.

 

  THE SHIP LURCHED AS PART OF IT SLID AWAY FROM THE WALL AND THEN
LURCHED AGAIN AS IT SLID BACK.

 

  "WHAT'S HAPPENING?" SAID MORRISON, LOOKING AT KALIININ, WHO SHOOK HER
HEAD IMPATIENTLY. SHE WAS TOTALLY ABSORBED IN HER WORK.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "SOPHIA IS TRYING TO NEUTRALIZE THE SHIP'S ELECTRIC
CHARGE HERE AND THERE SO THAT IT LETS GO BEFORE THE TENSION DAMAGES THE
WALL. AND SHE HAS TO FIND NEW AREAS OF ATTACHMENT TO KEEP FROM LOSING
THE WALL ALTOGETHER. IT'S NOT EASY, HAVING TO MINIATURIZE AND, AT THE
SAME TIME, STAYING ATTACHED TO THE WALL."

 

  MORRISON SAID, ALARMED, "HOW FAR WILL WE MINIATURIZE?"

 

  HIS WORDS WERE OVERBORNE BY KALIININ'S SHRILL COMMAND. "ARKADY, MOVE
IT FORWARD. GENTLY! JUST PUT FORWARD PRESSURE ON THE SHIP."

 

  "YES, SOPHIA -- BUT TELL ME WHEN TO STOP." TO MORRISON, HE ADDED, "MY
FATHER USED TO SAY: 'BETWEEN NOT ENOUGH AND TOO MUCH IS A HAIR'S
BREADTH.'"

 

  "MORE, MORE," SAID KALIININ. "ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'LL TRY." THE SHIP
SEEMED TO STICK AND STRAIN AND THEN IT SUDDENLY SLID FORWARD AND
MORRISON FELT HIMSELF THRUST GENTLY BACK AGAINST HIS SEAT.

 

  "GOOD," SAID KALIININ. "JUST A LITTLE LESS NOW."

 

  THE CELL CAME TO AN END. BEYOND IT WAS ANOTHER CELL. THIN CELLS, AS
CELLS WENT, A MERE FILM OF CELLS, FITTED TOGETHER TO MAKE A TINY TUBE,
WITH THE SHIP AND ITS CREW OF FIVE CLINGING TO THE INNER SURFACE BY
MINUTE ATTRACTIONS OF ELECTRIC CHARGE.

 

  THE SPACE BETWEEN THE ADJOINING CELLS SEEMED ROPY, WITH CABLES
STRETCHING FROM INSIDE ONE CELL TO THE OTHER. THEY WERE NOT ALL INTACT
AND THERE WERE STUMPS VISIBLE LIKE THE REMAINS OF A FELLED FOREST. IT
SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT THERE WERE NARROW GAPS IN THAT FELLED FOREST,
BUT HE COULDN'T SEE CLEARLY FROM THE ANGLE AT WHICH HE VIEWED THEM.

 

  HE SAID AGAIN, "HOW FAR WILL WE MINIATURIZE, ARKADY?"

 

  "EVENTUALLY TO THE SIZE OF A SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULE."

 

  "BUT WHAT WOULD THE CHANCES BE OF SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION AT
THAT SIZE?"

 

  "APPRECIABLE," SAID DEZHNEV. "MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS WHEN WE WERE THE
SIZE OF A RED CORPUSCLE OR EVEN OF A BLOOD PLATELET."

 

  "STILL NOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT," SAID BORANOVA. "I ASSURE YOU."

 

  "EXACTLY," SAID DEZHNEV AND RAISED HIS HAND SLIGHTLY WITH THE FIRST
TWO FINGERS CROSSED SO THAT MORRISON COULD JUST SEE IT AND BORANOVA,
FARTHER BACK, COULD NOT. THAT AMERICAN GESTURE HAD BECOME UNIVERSAL AND
MORRISON, KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT, FELT HIMSELF GROWING COLD
INSIDE.

 

  DEZHNEV WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD, BUT HE MIGHT HAVE SENSED
MORRISON'S GRIMACE OR HEARD HIS SOFT GRUNT. HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT
IT, YOUNG ALBERT. IT IS ALWAYS WISE TO HAVE BUT ONE WORRY AT A TIME AND
RIGHT NOW LET US WORRY ABOUT SQUEEZING OUT OF THE BLOOD VESSEL. --
SOPHIA, MY LOVED ONE."

 

  "YES, ARKADY," SHE SAID.

 

  "WEAKEN THE FIELD IN THE REAR OF THE SHIP AND WHEN I MOVE GROPE FOR
ONE AHEAD."

 

  "I WILL DO SO, ARKADY. DIDN'T YOUR FATHER ONCE SAY: 'THERE IS NO POINT
IN TRYING TO TEACH A THIEF TO STEAL'?"

 

  "YES, HE DID. STEAL, THEN, LITTLE THIEF, STEAL."

 

  MORRISON WONDERED WHETHER DEZHNEV AND KALIININ WERE DELIBERATELY BEING
LIGHTHEARTED IN THE FACE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUDDEN DEATH AS A WAY OF
CHEERING HIM UP? OR WERE THEY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR HIS COWARDICE? HE
CHOSE THE FORMER. SURELY WHEN AN ACTION MIGHT EQUALLY WELL BE
INTERPRETED AS FRIENDLY OR HOSTILE, ONE MIGHT AS WELL CHOOSE THE
FRIENDLY. PERHAPS DEZHNEV'S FATHER WOULD HAVE AGREED. WITH THAT THOUGHT,
HE FELT CHEERED.

 

  THE SHIP'S REAR SEEMED TO BE HANGING LOOSELY AND TO REMAIN SEVERAL
CENTIMETERS (SEVERAL PICOMETERS IN REAL MEASURE?) FROM THE WALL OF THE
CAPILLARY. MORRISON STUDIED IT CLOSELY AND COULD SEE THE SERRIED RANKS
OF PROTEIN AND LIPID MOLECULES THAT MADE UP THAT WALL.

 

  HE THOUGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING IGNORING THIS? HERE IS OUR OPPORTUNITY
TO STUDY TISSUES WITH GREATER PRECISION THAN THE BEST SCANNING ELECTRON
MICROSCOPE CAN -- AND TO STUDY THEM WHILE ALIVE; TO SEE NOT ONLY
POSITION BUT LIVING CHANGE AND MOTION. WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE
BLOODSTREAM AND NARROWED IN ON A CAPILLARY WALL WITHOUT LOOKING AT
ANYTHING IN ANY REAL SCIENTIFIC SENSE. WE ARE ONLY PASSING THROUGH, WITH
NO MORE INTEREST THAN WE WOULD SHOW IF WE WERE IN A SUBWAY, BARRELING
THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL. -- ALL TO STUDY OSCILLATIONS THAT MIGHT
BE PRODUCED BY THOUGHT ... AND MIGHT NOT.

 

  THE SHIP WAS INCHING ALONG (AN OLD WORD, THOUGHT MORRISON SUDDENLY,
ANTEDATING THE METRIC SYSTEM, BUT HE'D NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY
"CENTIMETERING ALONG") AS THOUGH IT WERE SOMEHOW FEELING ITS WAY.
PERHAPS, BETWEEN DEZHNEV'S MOTORS AND KALIININ'S FLICKERING ELECTRIC
FIELDS, THAT WAS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS DOING.

 

  "WE'RE APPROACHING THE JUNCTION, LITTLE SOPHIA," SAID DEZHNEV IN A
CURIOUSLY TIGHT VOICE. "MAKE SURE YOUR HOLD IS FIRM IN FRONT, WHILE I
MOVE FORWARD ANOTHER METER OR SO."

 

  "I SUSPECT FROM THE APPEARANCE AND ELECTRICAL BEHAVIOR," SAID
KALIININ, "THAT WE HAVE A CLUMP OF ARGININES TOWARD THE JUNCTION. THAT
REPRESENTS A STRONG REGION OF POSITIVE CHARGE AND I CAN HANDLE THAT AS
SMOOTHLY AS SOUR CREAM."

 

  BUT BORANOVA SAID STERNLY, "NO OVERCONFIDENCE, SOPHIA. KEEP A FIRM
WATCH. IF YOU MISS AND THE SHIP TEARS LOOSE, THERE WILL BE MUCH TO DO
OVER."

 

  "YES, NATALYA," SAID SOPHIA, "BUT WITH ALL RESPECT, THE WARNING IS NOT
REALLY NEEDED."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "SOPHIA, DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY. KEEP ONLY THE PROW OF
THE SHIP ATTACHED TO THE WALL, BUT STRONGLY. RELEASE EVERYTHING ELSE."

 

  "DONE," SAID SOPHIA FAINTLY.

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF HOLDING HIS BREATH. THE REAR OF THE SHIP HAD
SPUN AWAY FROM THE WALL, BUT IT HELD IN FRONT. THE BLOODSTREAM CAUGHT
THE DETACHED REAR END AND PUSHED THE SHIP INTO A POSITION AT RIGHT
ANGLES TO THE CURRENT, WHILE THE CAPILLARY WALL, WHERE THE SHIP STILL
HELD, MOVED OUTWARD LIKE A PIMPLE.

 

  MORRISON SAID TIGHTLY, "WATCH OUT. WE'LL PULL A SECTION OUT OF THE
WALL."

 

  "QUIET, ALL!" THUNDERED DEZHNEV. THEN, IN AN ORDINARY VOICE, "SOPHIA,
I SHALL INCREASE THE ENGINE PUSH SLOWLY. GET YOURSELF IN POSITION TO
BREAK ALL REMAINING ATTRACTION. THE SHIP IS TO BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL --
BUT NOT UNTIL I SAY SO."

 

  SOPHIA CAST A QUICK LOOK TOWARD BORANOVA, WHO SAID IN HER QUIET WAY,
"DO EXACTLY AS YOU'RE TOLD, SOPHIA. FOR THIS, ARKADY'S WORD IS
ABSOLUTE."

 

  MORRISON IMAGINED HE FELT THE SHIP STRAINING FORWARD. THE SECTION OF
THE CAPILLARY WALL TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED STRETCHED FARTHER AND
FARTHER.

 

  SOPHIA SAID URGENTLY, "ARKADY, EITHER THE FIELD WILL SNAP OR THE WALL
WILL."

 

  "ANOTHER MOMENT, DEAR ONE, ANOTHER MOMENT. -- NOW."

 

  THE WALL SNAPPED BACK AND THE SHIP BOUNDED FORWARD IN A GREAT LEAP
THAT ROCKED MORRISON GENTLY BACKWARD. THE FORWARD END OF THE SHIP BURIED
ITSELF IN THE CEMENT STUFF BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS OF THE CAPILLARY WALL.

 

  52.

 

  FOR THE FIRST TIME, MORRISON WAS AWARE OF THE LABORING OF THE
MICROFUSION ENGINES. THERE WAS A SUBLIMINAL THROBBING AS THE SHIP WORKED
ITS WAY THROUGH THE JOINT WITH WHAT SEEMED INCREASING DIFFICULTY. THERE
WAS NOTHING TO SEE UP AHEAD. THE THICKNESS OF THE CAPILLARY WALL, VERY
THIN THOUGH IT WAS IN NORMAL TERMS, WAS FAR THICKER THAN THE LENGTH OF
THE SHIP.

 

  THE SHIP WAS NOW TOTALLY IMMERSED IN THE JOINT AND DEZHNEV, BEADS OF
SWEAT ON HIS FOREHEAD, TURNED HIS HEAD AND SPOKE TO BORANOVA. "WE'RE
USING UP ENERGY FASTER THAN WE SHOULD."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THEN STOP THE SHIP AND LET'S CONSIDER."

 

  DESHNEV SAID, "IF I DO THAT, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE NATURAL
ELASTICITY OF THIS MATERIAL WILL POP US OUT OF THE JOINT AND BACK INTO
THE BLOODSTREAM."

 

  "SLOW THE ENGINES DOWN, THEN. CHOOSE A LEVEL THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO
KEEP US IN PLACE."

 

  THE THROBBING CAME TO AN END.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "THE JOINT IS EXERTING CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE ON THE
SHIP."

 

  "ENOUGH TO CRUSH US, ARKADY?"

 

  "NOT NOW. BUT WHO CAN SAY FOR THE FUTURE IF THE PRESSURE CONTINUES."

 

  MORRISON BURST OUT. "THIS IS RIDICULOUS. DIDN'T SOMEONE SAY WE'RE THE
SIZE OF A SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULE?"

 

  "WE'RE THE SIZE OF A GLUCOSE MOLECULE," SAID BORANOVA, "WHICH IS MADE
UP OF TWENTY-FOUR ATOMS ALTOGETHER."

 

  "THANK YOU," SAID MORRISON FREEZINGLY, "BUT I KNOW HOW MANY ATOMS
THERE ARE IN A GLUCOSE MOLECULE. AS IT HAPPENS, SMALL MOLECULES DRIFT
THROUGH THE CAPILLARY WALLS CONSTANTLY BY DIFFUSION. DIFFUSION! THAT'S
THE WAY THE BODY WORKS. WHY AREN'T WE DIFFUSING THROUGH?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DIFFUSION IS A STATISTICAL PROPOSITION. THERE ARE
TWENTY-FOUR BILLION TRILLION GLUCOSE MOLECULES IN THE BLOODSTREAM AT ANY
GIVEN TIME. THEY MOVE AROUND RANDOMLY AND SOME MANAGE TO HIT IN SUCH
PLACES AND IN SUCH WAYS AS TO MOVE THROUGH A JOINT, OR TO MOVE INTO THE
MEMBRANE OF A CAPILLARY WALL CELL, INTO THE CELL, AND OUT THE OTHER
SIDE. A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE SUCCEED AT ANY GIVEN SECOND, BUT THAT IS
ENOUGH TO ENSURE PROPER TISSUE FUNCTIONING. HOWEVER, BY CHANCE, A
PARTICULAR GLUCOSE MOLECULE MAY REMAIN IN THE BLOODSTREAM FOR A MONTH
WITHOUT DIFFUSING. CAN WE WAIT A MONTH FOR A CHANCE TO DO ITS WORK?"

 

  "THAT'S NO ARGUMENT, NATALYA," SAID MORRISON IMPATIENTLY. "WHY DON'T
WE SIMPLY DO DELIBERATELY WHAT A REAL GLUCOSE MOLECULE WOULD DO BY
CHANCE? ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN WE'RE PART WAY THROUGH THE JOINT. WHY ARE
WE STUCK IN POSITION?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "I'M ON ALBERT'S SIDE. DIFFUSION PROBABLY ISN'T A PASSIVE
LEAKAGE. THERE'S SOME SORT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE DIFFUSING OBJECT
AND THE BARRIER THROUGH WHICH THE DIFFUSION TAKES PLACE -- EXCEPT THAT
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE INTERACTION MIGHT BE EXACTLY. ESPECIALLY HERE,
WHERE WE FACE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER."

 

  "WE'RE HERE AT THE BARRIER," SAID DEZHNEV. "YOU'RE THE BRAIN EXPERT.
CAN YOU LOOK AROUND AND TELL US HOW THIS DIFFUSION WORKS?"

 

  "NO, I CAN'T. BUT GLUCOSE IS ONE MOLECULE THAT GETS THROUGH THE
BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER EASILY. IT MUST BECAUSE IT IS THE BRAIN'S SOLE FUEL
FOR ENERGY. THE TROUBLE IS THAT WHILE THE SHIP IS AS SMALL AS A GLUCOSE
MOLECULE, IT ISN'T A GLUCOSE MOLECULE."

 

  "ARE YOU GETTING AT SOMETHING, YURI," SAID BORANOVA, "OR IS THIS A
LECTURE?"

 

  "I'M GETTING AT SOMETHING. WE HAD THE SHIP BECOME UNCHARGED IN ORDER
TO LUNGE INTO THE JOINT, BUT WHY LEAVE IT UNCHARGED NOW? CAN IT BE GIVEN
THE CHARGE PATTERN OF A GLUCOSE MOLECULE? IF SO, IT WILL BE A GLUCOSE
MOLECULE AS FAR AS SHAPIROV'S BODY IS CONCERNED. I SUGGEST YOU ORDER IT
DONE, NATALYA."

 

  KALIININ DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ORDER. SHE SAID, "IT IS DONE, NATALYA."

 

  (THEY EACH ADDRESSED BORANOVA, MORRISON NOTED. EACH STILL MAINTAINED
THE FICTION OF THE OTHER'S NONEXISTENCE.)

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "AND THE JOINT'S PRESSURE DECREASES AT ONCE. IT
RECOGNIZES A FRIEND, SO IT BOWS POLITELY AND STEPS ASIDE. MY FATHER'S
MOTHER, LONG MAY I KEEP HER MEMORY, WOULD HAVE CRIED OUT, 'BLACK MAGIC,'
AND AT ONCE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN BENEATH THE BED."

 

  "ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA, "INCREASE THE POWER OF THE ENGINES AND PASS
THROUGH BEFORE THE JOINT NOTICES THAT UNDERNEATH THE GLUCOSE PATTERN IS
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GLUCOSE."

 

  "YES, NATALYA," SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "THIS ONE IS YOURS, YURI. YOUR SUGGESTION WAS JUST
RIGHT. IN HINDSIGHT I SEE THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT, TOO, BUT
THE FACT IS, I DIDN'T."

 

  KONEV SAID GRUFFLY, AS THOUGH FINDING PRAISE SOMETHING HE COULDN'T
HANDLE, "IT WAS NOTHING. SINCE THE BRAIN LIVES ON GLUCOSE, WE GOT DOWN
TO GLUCOSE SIZE. EVENTUALLY, WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE A GLUCOSE
PATTERN, AND AS SOON AS YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHY WE WEREN'T DIFFUSING
WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, I REALIZED WE NEEDED THE PATTERN ALREADY."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION, WE ARE THROUGH THE JOINT. WE
ARE OUT OF THE BLOODSTREAM. WE ARE IN THE BRAIN."

 

  53.

 

  IN THE BRAIN, THOUGHT MORRISON, BUT NOT IN A BRAIN CELL. SO FAR THEY
HAD ONLY PASSED FROM THE INTERCELLULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE CELLS OF THE
CAPILLARY WALL, INTO THE INTERCELLULAR SPACES OF THE BRAIN WHERE THE
SUPPORT STRUCTURES EXISTED THAT MAINTAINED THE FORM AND
INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF THE NERVE CELLS, OR NEURONS. REMOVE THEM AND THE
CELLS WOULD SQUASH INTO AMORPHOUS MASSES, PULLED TOGETHER BY GRAVITY AND
UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ANY SENSIBLE FUNCTION.

 

  IT WAS A JUNGLE, MADE UP OF THICK VINY THREADS OF COLLAGEN. (THIS WAS
THE NEARLY UNIVERSAL ANIMAL CONNECTIVE PROTEIN THAT FULFILLED THE
FUNCTION OF CELLULOSE IN PLANTS, LESS CHEAPLY, SINCE IT WAS PROTEIN
RATHER THAN CARBOHYDRATE, BUT FAR MORE FLEXIBLY.) THROUGH THE EYE OF
ULTRAMINIATURIZATION, THOSE COLLAGEN THREADS, TOTALLY INVISIBLE WITHOUT
AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE, LOOKED LIKE TREE TRUNKS, LEANING THIS WAY AND
THAT IN A WORLD IN WHICH GRAVITY WAS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE.

 

  THERE WERE FINER AND STILL FINER THREADS. MORRISON KNEW THAT SOME OF
THEM MIGHT BE ELASTIN AND THAT THE COLLAGEN ITSELF MIGHT COME IN SUBTLY
DIFFERENT VARIETIES. IF HE COULD SEE THE WHOLE IN A WIDER VIEW, FROM A
LESS-MINIATURIZED STANDPOINT, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETECT ORDER
AND STRUCTURE. AT THIS LEVEL, HOWEVER, IT WAS CHAOTIC. ONE COULDN'T EVEN
SEE FAR IN ANY DIRECTION; THE OVERLAPPING FIBERS BLOCKED VISION.

 

  MORRISON BECAME AWARE THAT THE SHIP WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY. THE FOUR
OTHERS WERE EACH STARING AROUND IN WONDER. EITHER THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED
THIS (MORRISON HADN'T, FOR HE HAD BEEN TOO INTERESTED IN THE ELECTRICAL
PROPERTIES OF THE BRAIN TO THINK MUCH CONCERNING ITS MICROANATOMY) OR,
IF THEY HAD, THEY HAD NEVERTHELESS FAILED TO VISUALIZE IT.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND YOUR WAY TO A NEURON? DOES
ANYBODY KNOW?"

 

  DEZHNEV WAS THE FIRST TO ANSWER, "THE SHIP CAN ONLY MOVE STRAIGHT
AHEAD, SO WE MOVE STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL WE GET TO A CELL."

 

  "HOW DO WE MOVE STRAIGHT AHEAD THROUGH THIS JUNGLE? IF WE CAN'T STEER
THE SHIP, HOW DO WE MOVE AROUND OBSTACLES?"

 

  DEZHNEV RUBBED HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY. "WE DON'T MOVE AROUND, WE PUSH
AROUND. THE SHIP WILL MOVE PAST ONE OF THOSE OBJECTS AND THERE WILL BE
MORE FRICTION ON THE CONTACT SIDE THAN ON THE OTHER, SO OUR PATH BENDS,
LIKE A COMET ROUNDING THE SUN." HE SMILED. "COSMONAUTS DO THAT WHEN THEY
USE GRAVITY TO SKIM AROUND A SATELLITE OR PLANET. WE'LL DO IT TO SKIM
AROUND THOSE THINGS."

 

  KONEV SAID MOROSELY, "THOSE THINGS ARE COLLAGEN FIBERS."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY THICK. YOU WON'T ALWAYS PASS
BY. YOU'LL HIT ONE HEAD-ON AND STAY THERE AND IF YOU CAN ONLY MOVE
FORWARD, WHAT WILL YOU DO? THIS SHIP WAS DESIGNED ONLY FOR THE
BLOODSTREAM. WE'RE HELPLESS OUT OF IT WITH NOTHING TO CARRY US ALONG."

 

  BORANOVA INTERPOSED. "ARKADY, YOU HAVE THREE MICROFUSION ENGINES AND
THE JETS, I KNOW, ARE ARRANGED AT THE REAR AT THE APICES OF AN
EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE. CAN YOU FIRE ONLY ONE OF THEM?"

 

  "NO. ONE CONTACT CONTROLS ALL THREE."

 

  "YES, ARKADY, THAT IS HOW IT IS NOW. BUT YOU DESIGNED THE SHIP AND YOU
KNOW THE DETAILS OF ITS CONTROLS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO MODIFY
THEM SO THAT YOU CAN FIRE THEM ONE AT A TIME?"

 

  DEZHNEV TOOK A DEEP BREATH. "EVERYONE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT
I MUST CUT CORNERS, THAT I MUST SAVE THE BUDGET, THAT I MUST DO NOTHING
TO IRRITATE THE BUREAUCRATS."

 

  "ASIDE FROM THAT, ARKADY, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?"

 

  "LET ME THINK. IT MEANS JURY-RIGGING. IT MEANS FINDING SOMETHING TO
MAKE SWITCHES OUT OF, AND EXTRA WIRE, AND WHO KNOWS IF IT WILL WORK OR
HOW LONG IT WILL WORK IF IT DOES, AND IF WE WON'T END UP WORSE THAN WE
ARE. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN, THOUGH. IF I CAN FIRE ONLY ONE OF THE ENGINES,
IT WILL SET UP AN UNBALANCED THRUST."

 

  "YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STEER THEN, DEPENDING ON WHICH YOU FIRE."

 

  "I'LL TRY, NATALYA."

 

  MORRISON SAID ANGRILY, "WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF THIS WHEN WE WERE IN
THE WRONG CAPILLARY? IT MIGHT HAVE SAVED ME THE SMALL TROUBLE OF NEARLY
DYING TRYING TO TURN THE SHIP BY HAND."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "IF YOU HADN'T SO PROMPTLY SUGGESTED TURNING THE SHIP BY
HAND, WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT -- BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A GOOD
IDEA."

 

  "WHY NOT?"

 

  "WE WERE IN THE CURRENT OF THE BLOODSTREAM. THE SHIP IS CAREFULLY
STREAMLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND ITS SURFACE IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW
WATER TO FLOW PAST IT WITHOUT TURBULENCE, WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE HARDER
TO TURN OUT OF THE CURRENT. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MUCH LONGER THAN TURNING
BY HAND -- AND VERY MUCH MORE ENERGY. THE NARROW CONFINES OF THE
CAPILLARY MUST BE REMEMBERED, TOO. HERE, THERE IS NO CURRENT AND BECAUSE
WE'VE BEEN SO MINIATURIZED THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF ROOM."

 

  "ENOUGH," SAID BORANOVA. "GET TO WORK, ARKADY."

 

  DEZHNEV DID SO, RUMMAGING THROUGH A TOOL CHEST, REMOVING A COVER PLATE
AND STUDYING THE CONTROL DETAILS WITHIN, MAINTAINING THROUGH IT ALL A
KIND OF INCOHERENT MUTTERING.

 

  KONEV, HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS NECK, SAID, WITHOUT TURNING,
"ALBERT, TELL US ABOUT THOSE SENSATIONS YOU RECEIVE."

 

  "SENSATIONS?"

 

  "YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT THEM JUST BEFORE WE GOT THE NEWS FROM THE
GROTTO THAT WE WERE LOCATED IN THE CORRECT CAPILLARY. I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE SENSATIONS YOU EXPERIENCED WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO ANALYZE THE
THOUGHT WAVES."

 

  "AH," SAID MORRISON AND CAUGHT KALIININ'S EYE.

 

  VERY SLIGHTLY, SHE SHOOK HER HEAD. VERY TENTATIVELY, A WARNING FINGER
CROSSED HER LIPS.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "NOTHING TO TELL. I HAD VAGUE SENSATIONS I COULDN'T
DESCRIBE IN ANY OBJECTIVE WAY. IT COULD WELL HAVE BEEN MY IMAGINATION.
CERTAINLY THOSE WHOM I TRIED TO TELL ABOUT IT WERE CONVINCED IT WAS."

 

  "AND YOU NEVER PUBLISHED ANYTHING ABOUT THEM?"

 

  "NEVER. I MERELY MENTIONED IT IN PASSING AT CONVENTIONS AND THAT WAS
BAD ENOUGH. IF SHAPIROV AND YOU HEARD OF IT, IT WAS THROUGH WORD OF
MOUTH ONLY. IF I HAD PUBLISHED, THAT WOULD HAVE COME AS NEAR TO
SCIENTIFIC SUICIDE AS I WOULD EVER WANT TO BE."

 

  "TOO BAD."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED BRIEFLY TOWARD KALIININ. SHE HAD NODDED VERY SLIGHTLY,
BUT SAID NOTHING. CLEARLY, SHE COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING WITHOUT BEING
OVERHEARD BY THE ENTIRE SHIP.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND CARELESSLY. DEZHNEV WAS LOST IN HIS WORK,
CLUCKING TO HIMSELF. KONEV STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD, LOST IN WHATEVER
TORTUOUS THOUGHTS HE HAPPENED TO HAVE. BORANOVA, BEHIND KALIININ, WAS
STUDYING THE SCREEN OF HER COMPUTER CAREFULLY AND WAS MAKING NOTES.
MORRISON DID NOT TRY TO READ THEM -- HE COULD READ ENGLISH UPSIDE DOWN,
BUT HE HADN'T COME TO THAT PITCH OF EASE WITH RUSSIAN.

 

  ONLY KALIININ, TO HIS LEFT, WAS LOOKING AT HIM.

 

  MORRISON PRESSED HIS LIPS TOGETHER AND THEN SHIFTED HIS COMPUTER INTO
A WORD-PROCESSING MODE. IT DID NOT HAVE A CYRILLIC ADJUNCT, BUT HE
SPELLED OUT THE RUSSIAN WORDS IN PHONETIC ROMAN LETTERING. WHAT IS
WRONG?

 

  SHE HESITATED, PROBABLY NOT VERY MUCH AT HOME IN ROMAN.

 

  THEN HER OWN FINGERS FLASHED AND THE NEAT CYRILLIC ON HER SCREEN READ:
DON'T TRUST HIM. SAY NOTHING. IT WAS ERASED AT ONCE.

 

  MORRISON WROTE: WHY?

 

  KALIININ SAID: NOT EVIL, BUT PRIORITY, CREDIT. WILL DO ANYTHING,
ANYTHING, ANYTHING.

 

  THE WORDS WERE GONE AND SHE LOOKED AWAY FIRMLY.

 

  MORRISON CONSIDERED HER THOUGHTFULLY. WAS IT ONLY THE VENGEFULNESS OF
A WOMAN BETRAYED?

 

  IT DIDN'T MATTER, IN ANY CASE, FOR HE HAD NO INTENTION OF TALKING
ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HE HADN'T ALREADY GIVEN AWAY, EITHER IN A PAPER OR
BY WORD OF MOUTH. HE HIMSELF WAS NOT EVIL, BUT WHERE PRIORITY AND CREDIT
WERE CONCERNED, HE MIGHT NOT DO ANYTHING, ANYTHING, ANYTHING, BUT HE
WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL.

 

  STILL, THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE AT THAT MOMENT. OR ONE THING,
PERHAPS, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY ASIDE FROM THE POINT, BUT WHICH WAS
BEGINNING, JUST BEGINNING, TO OCCUPY HIS MIND TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER
THINGS.

 

  HE TURNED TO BORANOVA, WHO WAS STILL STARING AT HER INSTRUMENT AND
TAPPING HER FINGERS SOFTLY AGAINST THE ARM OF HER SEAT IN THOUGHTFUL
CONCENTRATION.

 

  "NATALYA?"

 

  "YES, ALBERT?" SHE DID NOT LOOK UP.

 

  "I HATE TO INTRODUCE A NOTE OF UGLY REALISM, BUT" -- HIS VOICE LOWERED
TO NEAR-SOUNDLESSNESS -- "I'M THINKING OF URINATING."

 

  SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM, A CORNER OF HER LIPS TWITCHING VERY SLIGHTLY,
BUT AVOIDING THE SMILE. SHE DID NOT LOWER HER VOICE. "WHY THINK OF IT,
ALBERT? DO IT."

 

  MORRISON FELT LIKE A LITTLE BOY RAISING HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO
LEAVE THE ROOM -- UNREASONABLY SO, HE KNEW. "I DON'T LIKE TO BE THE
FIRST."

 

  BORANOVA FROWNED, ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE WERE THE TEACHER IN THE CASE.
"THAT IS QUITE SILLY AND, IN ANY CASE, YOU ARE NOT. I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN
CARE OF SUCH A NEED IN MYSELF." THEN, WITH A FAINT SHRUG, "TENSION TENDS
TO INCREASE URGENCY, I HAVE FREQUENTLY FOUND."

 

  MORRISON HAD FREQUENTLY FOUND THAT, TOO. HE WHISPERED, "IT'S ALL VERY
WELL FOR YOU. YOU'RE THERE IN THE BACK SEAT ALONE." AND HE NODDED
SLIGHTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF SOPHIA.

 

  "SO?" BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "SURELY YOU DON'T WISH ME TO IMPROVISE
A CURTAIN FOR YOU? SHALL I PLACE MY HAND OVER HER EYES." (KALIININ
LOOKED IN THEIR DIRECTION IN SURPRISE.) "SHE WILL IGNORE YOU, I'M SURE,
OUT OF DECENCY AND OUT OF A FEELING THAT IN SHORT ORDER SHE WILL WISH
YOU TO IGNORE HER."

 

  MORRISON WAS KEENLY EMBARRASSED, FOR KALIININ WAS NOW LOOKING AT HIM
WITH OBVIOUS UNDERSTANDING. SHE SAID, "COME, ALBERT, I HELD YOU NAKED IN
MY LAP. WHAT ROOM NEED ONE MAKE FOR MODESTY NOW?"

 

  MORRISON SMILED WEAKLY AND MADE A LITTLE THANK-YOU GESTURE.

 

  HE TRIED TO REMEMBER HOW TO MANAGE THE WASTE LID ON HIS SEAT, BUT ONCE
HE REMEMBERED, HE FOUND THAT IT SLID OPEN WITH A SMALL BUT DEFINITE
CLICK. (THOSE IRRITATING SOVIETS! BACKWARD ALWAYS IN SMALL WAYS. IT
MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO OPEN NOISELESSLY.)

 

  HE ALSO MANAGED TO LOOSEN THE ELECTROSTATIC SEAM ALONG HIS CROTCH AND
THEN FOUND HIMSELF WORRYING WHETHER HE WOULD MANAGE TO CLOSE IT
UNOBTRUSIVELY AFTERWARD.

 

  MORRISON FELT THE CURRENT OF AIR AT THE MOMENT THE WASTE LID OPENED
AND IT FELT UNCOMFORTABLY COLD AGAINST HIS BARE SKIN. HE SIGHED WITH A
TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN HE WAS DONE, THEN HE MANAGED TO CLOSE THE SEAL
ALONG THE CROTCH AND SAT THERE, PANTING. HE REALIZED THAT HE MUST HAVE
BEEN HOLDING HIS BREATH.

 

  "HERE," SAID BORANOVA BRUSQUELY. HE STARED, FOR A MOMENT, AT WHAT SHE
WAS HOLDING, THEN RECOGNIZED IT AS A SMALL SEALED TOWEL. HE TORE OPEN
THE SEAL, FOUND THE TOWEL WITHIN MOISTENED AND SCENTED AND RUBBED HIS
HANDS WITH IT. (THE SOVIETS WERE LEARNING SMALL ELEGANCES, OBVIOUSLY --
OR DECADENCES, DEPENDING ON WHETHER FINICKINESS OR IMPATIENCE WON THE
BATTLE FOR DOMINATION WITHIN YOU.)

 

  AND THEN DEZHNEV'S THROATY VOICE SOUNDED LOUDLY, VERY LOUDLY, IN
MORRISON'S EAR AFTER ALL THE WHISPERING HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN. "THAT'S
DONE NOW."

 

  "WHAT'S DONE?" ASKED MORRISON ANGRILY, AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMING THE
REFERENCE WAS TO HIS BODILY FUNCTIONS.

 

  "THE INDIVIDUAL FIRING OF THE MOTORS," SAID DEZHNEV, MAKING A
THERE-YOU-ARE GESTURE WITH BOTH HANDS IN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE SHIP'S
CONTROLS. "I CAN FIRE ANY ONE, OR TWO, OR ALL THREE, IF I WISH.
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN -- I THINK."

 

  "WHICH IS IT, ARKADY?" SAID BORANOVA WASPISHLY. "IS IT QUITE CERTAIN
OR IS IT A MATTER OF OPINION?"

 

  "BOTH," SAID DEZHNEV. "IT IS MY OPINION THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.
THE TROUBLE IS THAT MY OPINION ISN'T ALWAYS RIGHT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY
--"

 

  "I THINK WE OUGHT TO TRY IT OUT," SAID KONEV, CUTTING OFF DEZHNEV'S
FATHER, PERHAPS IN THE FULL REALIZATION HE WAS DOING SO.

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID DEZHNEV. "THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, BUT AS MY FATHER
USED TO SAY" -- HE RAISED HIS VOICE AS THOUGH DETERMINED NOT TO BE AGAIN
SUBVERTED -- "THE SURE THING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING IS
THAT SOMEONE IS BOUND TO SAY IT. -- AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW --"

 

  HE PAUSED MOMENTARILY AND BORANOVA SAID, "WHAT MIGHT WE AS WELL KNOW?"

 

  "SEVERAL THINGS, NATASHA," SAID DEZHNEV. "IN THE FIRST PLACE, STEERING
WILL TAKE A LOT OF ENERGY. I'VE DONE MY BEST, BUT THE SHIP IS NOT
DESIGNED FOR THIS. FOR ANOTHER -- WELL, I CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THE
GROTTO NOW."

 

  "CAN'T COMMUNICATE?" SAID KALIININ, HER VOICE RISING TO A NEAR SQUEAK
IN WHAT WAS EITHER SURPRISE OR INDIGNATION.

 

  BORANOVA'S VOICE MARKED HER AS DEFINITELY INDIGNANT. "WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE?"

 

  "COME, NATASHA, I CAN'T WIRE UP THE MOTORS SEPARATELY WITHOUT WIRES,
CAN I? THE BEST ENGINEER IN THE WORLD CAN'T MAKE WIRES OUT OF NOTHING
AND CAN'T MANUFACTURE SILICON CHIPS OUT OF NOTHING, EITHER. SOMETHING
HAD TO BE DISMANTLED AND THE ONE THING I COULD DISMANTLE WITHOUT
DISABLING THE SHIP WAS COMMUNICATIONS. I TOLD THEM THAT OUT IN THE
GROTTO AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SHRIEKING AND COMPLAINING, BUT HOW COULD
THEY STOP ME? SO NOW WE CAN STEER, I THINK -- AND WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE,
I KNOW."

 

  54.

 

  THERE WAS SILENCE AS THE SHIP BEGAN TO MOVE. THE SURROUNDINGS WERE
UTTERLY DIFFERENT NOW. IN THE BLOODSTREAM, THERE HAD BEEN A HEAVING
MEDLEY OF OBJECTS -- SOME CRAWLING AHEAD OF THE SHIP, SOME SLOWLY
DRIFTING BEHIND, DEPENDING ON EDDIES AND STREAMLINING, MORRISON
SUPPOSED. THERE WAS THE FEELING OF MOVEMENT, IF ONLY BECAUSE THE
MARKINGS ON THE WALLS -- FATTY PLAQUES IN THE ARTERIES, TILING IN THE
CAPILLARIES, SLIPPED STEADILY BACKWARD.

 

  HERE, IN INTERCELLULAR SPACE, HOWEVER, THERE WAS STASIS. NO MOTION. NO
FEELING OF LIFE. THE TANGLE OF COLLAGEN FIBERS SEEMED A FOREST PRIMEVAL,
BUILT UP OF TRUNKS ONLY, WITHOUT LEAVES, WITHOUT COLOR, WITHOUT SOUND,
WITHOUT MOTION.

 

  ONCE THE SHIP PUSHED FORWARD THROUGH THE VISCOUS INTERCELLULAR FLUID,
HOWEVER, EVERYTHING BEGAN TO MOVE BACKWARD. THE SHIP SLIPPED TOWARD AND
THROUGH A V-SHAPED MEETING OF FIBERS AND, AS THEY PASSED THROUGH,
MORRISON HAD THE PLAIN IMPRESSION OF A LOOSE SPIRAL MAKING ITS WAY
UPWARD ALONG EACH COLLAGEN FIBER, THE SPIRAL BEING MORE MARKED ON THE
THINNER OF THE TWO.

 

  UP AHEAD WAS A THICKER FIBER STILL, A MONARCH OF THE COLLAGEN JUNGLE.

 

  "YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN, ARKADY," SAID KONEV. "NOW'S THE TIME TO TEST
IT."

 

  "ALL RIGHT, BUT I'LL HAVE TO LEAN OVER. I DON'T HAVE THE CONTROLS
NEATLY AT MY FINGERTIPS. THERE'S A LIMIT TO IMPROVIZATION." HE LEANED
FORWARD, GROPING AT A LEVEL ABOUT THAT OF HIS CALVES. "I DO NOT RELISH
THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO DO THIS CONSTANTLY. IT IS HARD ON A MAN OF
PORTLY HABIT."

 

  "YOU MEAN A MAN WHO IS FAT," SAID KONEV ILL-NATUREDLY. "YOU HAVE LET
YOURSELF GO FLABBY, ARKADY. YOU SHOULD LOSE WEIGHT."

 

  DEZHNEV STRAIGHTENED UP. "VERY WELL. I WILL STOP RIGHT NOW, GO HOME,
AND BEGIN TO LOSE WEIGHT. IS THIS A TIME, YURI, TO LECTURE ME?"

 

  "IT IS NOT A TIME FOR YOU TO GET EMOTIONAL EITHER, ARKADY," SAID
BORANOVA. "STEER!"

 

  DEZHNEV BENT OVER, SUPPRESSING A GRUNT. SLOWLY, THE SHIP TURNED
RIGHTWARD IN A GENTLE ARC; OR, TO JUDGE MORE LITERALLY BY APPEARANCE,
THE THICK COLLAGEN FIBER DRIFTED LEFTWARD AS IT APPROACHED -- AS DID
EVERYTHING ELSE.

 

  "YOU WILL HIT IT," SAID KONEV. "TURN MORE SHARPLY."

 

  "IT WON'T TURN MORE SHARPLY," SAID DEZHNEV. "EACH MOTOR IS ONLY SO FAR
OFF-CENTER AND I CAN'T CHANGE THAT."

 

  "WELL, THEN, WE WILL HIT IT," SAID KONEV, AN EDGE OF ANXIETY IN HIS
VOICE.

 

  "THEN LET US HIT," SAID BORANOVA ANGRILY. "YURI, DO NOT GO INTO PANIC
OVER INCONSEQUENTIALS. THE SHIP IS TOUGH PLASTIC; THAT FIBER IS
UNDOUBTEDLY RUBBERY."

 

  AND AS SHE SPOKE, THE PROW OF THE SHIP BEGAN TO PASS THE COLLAGEN
FIBER, WITH LITTLE ROOM TO SPARE. WATCHING THROUGH THE PORT SIDE OF THE
SHIP, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE BROADENING BEAM OF THE SHIP WOULD MAKE
CONTACT. WHEN THE FIBER WAS NEARLY LEVEL WITH KALIMIN'S SEAT, IT
HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO SCRAPING SOUND, ONLY A VERY SOFT HISS COULD BE
DETECTED. NOT ONLY WAS THE FIBER RUBBERY, AS BORANOVA HAD SAID, SO THAT
IT COMPRESSED SLIGHTLY UNDER THE FORCE OF THE COLLISION, THEN REBOUNDED,
PUSHING THE SHIP A TRIFLE AWAY -- BUT THE SLIMY INTERCELLULAR FLUID
SERVED AS A CUSHION AND A FRICTION REDUCER.

 

  THE SHIP CONTINUED TO MOVE AND TURNED LEFTWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
FIBER.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "I SHUT OFF THE MOTOR AS SOON AS I SAW WE WERE ABOUT TO
MAKE CONTACT. THIS LEFTWARD TURN WE'RE GOING THROUGH NOW IS A FRICTION
TURN."

 

  "YES," SAID KONEV, "BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD WANTED TO TURN IN THE OTHER
DIRECTION?"

 

  "THEN I WOULD HAVE USED THE MOTOR. OR, CONSIDERABLY EARLIER IN OUR
PROGRESS, I WOULD HAVE MADE A TURN TOWARD A GRAZE WITH THE FIBER TO THE
RIGHT. THAT FIBER WOULD HAVE TURNED US RIGHTWARD. THE MAIN THING, IN ANY
CASE, IS TO USE THE MOTORS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND THE FIBERS AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE. IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE DON'T WANT TO CONSUME OUR SUPPLY OF
ENERGY TOO RAPIDLY. IN THE SECOND PLACE, THE RAPID OUTPUT OF ENERGY
INCREASES THE CHANCES OF SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION."

 

  "WHAT!" CRIED MORRISON. HE TURNED TO BORANOVA. "IS THAT TRUE?"

 

  "IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT EFFECT," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT IT'S TRUE. THE
CHANCES GO UP A BIT. I SHOULD SAY THAT CONSERVATION IS THE MORE
IMPORTANT OF THE TWO REASONS FOR SAVING ENERGY."

 

  BUT MORRISON COULD NOT REPRESS HIS ANGER. "DON'T YOU SEE HOW
RIDICULOUS -- NO, CRIMINAL -- THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS? WE'RE IN A SHIP
THAT SIMPLY ISN'T UP TO THE TASK AND EVERYTHING WE DO MAKES IT WORSE."

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD. "ALBERT, PLEASE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO CHOICE."

 

  "BESIDES," SAID DEZHNEV, GRINNING, "IF WE MANAGE TO DO THE JOB IN THIS
UNSUITABLE SHIP, THINK HOW MUCH MORE REMARKABLE THAT WILL MAKE US. WE
WILL BE HEROES. AUTHENTIC HEROES. WE WILL SURELY GET THE ORDER OF LENIN
-- EACH ONE OF US. IT WILL BE A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. AND IF WE FAIL, IT
IS COMFORTING TO THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT AS THE SHIP'S
FAULT."

 

  "YES. SOVIET HEROES, WIN OR LOSE, ALL OF YOU," SAID MORRISON. "AND
WHAT WILL I BE?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "REMEMBER, ALBERT, YOU WILL NOT BE NEGLECTED IF WE
SUCCEED. THE ORDER OF LENIN HAS BEEN GIVEN TO FOREIGNERS ON A NUMBER OF
OCCASIONS, INCLUDING MANY AMERICANS. EVEN IF YOU SHOULD NOT WANT THE
HONOR FOR SOME REASON, THE SUCCESS OF YOUR THEORIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED
AND YOU MAY RECEIVE A NOBEL PRIZE BEFORE ANY OF US DO."

 

  "WE'RE IN NO POSITION TO COUNT OUR CHICKENS," SAID MORRISON. "I SHALL
REFRAIN FROM COMPOSING MY NOBEL ACCEPTANCE SPEECH FOR JUST A WHILE,
THANK YOU."

 

  "ACTUALLY," SAID KALIININ, "I WONDER IF WE'RE IN A POSITION TO REACH A
NEURON."

 

  "WHAT'S THE DIFFICULTY?" ASKED DEZHNEV. "WE CAN MOVE AND STEER AND
WE'RE OUTSIDE THE CAPILLARY AND IN THE BRAIN. JUST OUT THERE IS A
NEURON, ANY NUMBER OF THEM, BILLIONS OF THEM."

 

  "JUST OUT WHERE?" KALIININ ASKED. "I DON'T SEE ANY NEURONS. JUST
COLLAGEN FIBERS."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "HOW MUCH OF THIS INTERCELLULAR FLUID DO YOU THINK THERE
IS?"

 

  "A MICROSCOPIC THICKNESS," SAID KALIININ, "IF WE WERE NORMAL IN SIZE.
HOWEVER, WE'RE THE SIZE OF A GLUCOSE MOLECULE AND, RELATIVE TO
OURSELVES, THERE MAY BE A KILOMETER'S DISTANCE OR MORE TO THE NEAREST
NEURON."

 

  "WELL, THEN," SAID DEZHNEV, "WE'LL MOVE OUR SHIP A KILOMETER. IT MAY
TAKE A LITTLE TIME BUT IT CAN BE DONE."

 

  "YES, IF WE COULD MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE, BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A DENSE JUNGLE. WE HAVE TO TURN AND TWIST AROUND THIS FIBER AND THAT
AND, IN THE END, WE MAY TRAVEL FIFTY KILOMETERS BY OUR OWN MEASUREMENT
AND FIND OURSELVES BACK AT OUR STARTING POINT. WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE
BLUNDERING THROUGH A MAZE AND WE WON'T REACH A NEURON EXCEPT BY SHEEREST
ACCIDENT."

 

  "YURI HAS A MAP," SAID DEZHNEV, SOUNDING A LITTLE NONPLUSSED. "YURI'S
CEREBRO-WHATEVER--"

 

  KONEV, FROWNING, SHOOK HIS HEAD. "MY CEREBROGRAPH SHOWS ME THE
CIRCULATORY NETWORK OF THE BRAIN AND THE CELL PATTERN, BUT I CAN'T
EXPAND IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL INDICATE OUR POSITION IN THE
INTERCELLULAR FLUID BETWEEN CELLS, WE DON'T KNOW THAT SORT OF FINE
DETAIL AND WE CAN'T GET OUT OF CEREBROGRAPHY ANY MORE THAN WE CAN PUT
INTO IT."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED THROUGH THE WALL OF THE SHIP. IN ALL DIRECTIONS, THE
COLLAGEN FIBERS COULD BE MADE OUT, OVERLAPPING AND BLOCKING THEM IN. IN
NO DIRECTION COULD THE EYE SEE THROUGH THEM VERY FAR AND IN NO DIRECTION
WAS THERE ANY SIGN OF ANYTHING BUT FIBER UPON FIBER.

 

  NO NERVE CELLS! NO NEURONS!

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 13 -- CELL

 

  THE WALL THAT SAYS "WELCOME, STRANGER" HAS NEVER BEEN BUILT.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  55.

 

  BORANOVA'S NOSTRILS FLARED SLIGHTLY AND HER DARK EYEBROWS HUNCHED
TOGETHER, BUT HER VOICE REMAINED CALM.

 

  "ARKADY," SHE SAID, "YOU WILL TRAVEL FORWARD IN AS STRAIGHT A LINE AS
POSSIBLE. CURVE TO A MINIMUM EXTENT AND, IF YOU CAN, CURVE LEFT AND
RIGHT ALTERNATELY. AND, SINCE WE'RE IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SITUATION, UP
AND DOWN ALTERNATELY."

 

  "IT WOULD GET CONFUSING, NATASHA," SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  "OF COURSE IT WILL, BUT PERHAPS IT WON'T GET COMPLETELY CONFUSING. WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL RULER-STRAIGHT, BUT MAYBE WE WON'T GO IN
CIRCLES, SPIRALS, OR HELIXES EITHER. AND SOONER OR LATER WE SHOULD REACH
A CELL."

 

  "PERHAPS," SAID DEZHNEV, "IF YOU DEMINIATURIZE THE SHIP A LITTLE BIT
--"

 

  "NO," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "WAIT, NATASHA. THINK ABOUT IT. IF WE DEMINIATURIZE A BIT, THEN THERE
WILL BE LESS SPACE TO TRAVEL. WE GROW LARGER, THE SPACE BETWEEN BLOOD
VESSEL AND NEURON GROWS SMALLER." HE MADE ELOQUENT GESTURES WITH HIS
HANDS. "YOU UNDERSTAND?"

 

  "I UNDERSTAND. BUT THE LARGER WE GET, ARKADY, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT
WILL BE TO PASS BETWEEN THE FIBERS. THE NEURONS OF THE BRAIN ARE
WELL-PROTECTED. THE BRAIN IS THE ONLY ORGAN TO BE COMPLETELY ENCASED IN
BONE AND THE NEURONS THEMSELVES, WHICH ARE THE MOST IRREGULAR IN THE
BODY, ARE WELL-PACKED WITH INTERCELLULAR MATERIAL. LOOK FOR YOURSELF.
IT'S ONLY IF WE'RE DOWN TO THE SIZE OF A GLUCOSE MOLECULE THAT WE CAN
MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH AND AROUND THE COLLAGEN WITHOUT, PERHAPS, DOING
DRASTIC DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN."

 

  AT THIS POINT, KONEV COMMITTED THE UNUSUAL ACT OF TURNING IN HIS SEAT,
LOOKING UPWARD AS HE TURNED TO HIS LEFT SO THAT HIS GLANCE PASSED OVER
KALIININ BEFORE MEETING BORANOVA'S EYES. HE SAID, "I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
TO TRAVEL ONWARD COMPLETELY BLIND -- COMPLETELY AT RANDOM."

 

  "HOW OTHERWISE, YURI?" ASKED BORANOVA.

 

  "SURELY THE NEURONS GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY. EACH HAS NERVE IMPULSES
RUNNING ITS LENGTH PERIODICALLY AND AT VERY SHORT INTERVALS. THAT MIGHT
BE DETECTED."

 

  MORRISON FROWNED. "THE NEURONS ARE INSULATED."

 

  "THE AXONS ARE -- NOT THE CELL BODIES."

 

  "BUT IT IS THE AXONS WHERE THE NERVE IMPULSE IS STRONGEST."

 

  "NO, IT IS THE SYNAPSES WHERE THE NERVE IMPULSE MAY BE STRONGEST AND
THEY ARE NOT INSULATED, EITHER. THE SYNPASES OUGHT TO BE SPARKING ALL
THE TIME AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DETECT IT."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WE COULDN'T IN THE CAPILLARY."

 

  "WE WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CAPILLARY WALL AT THE TIME. -- LOOK,
ALBERT, WHY ARE YOU ARGUING THE MATTER? I'M ASKING YOU TO TRY TO DETECT
BRAIN WAVES. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE, ISN'T IT?"

 

  "I WAS KIDNAPPED," SAID MORRISON VIOLENTLY. "THAT'S WHY I'M HERE."

 

  BORANOVA LEANED FORWARD. "ALBERT, WHATEVER THE REASON, YOU'RE HERE AND
YURI'S SUGGESTION IS A REASONABLE ONE. -- AND, YURI, MUST YOU ALWAYS BE
CONFRONTATIONAL?"

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF SHAKING WITH ANGER AND FOR A MOMENT HE WASN'T
SURE WHY. KONEV'S SUGGESTION WAS INDEED REASONABLE.

 

  THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS BEING ASKED TO PUT HIS THEORIES TO
THE TEST UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM NO ESCAPE. HE WAS ON THE
VERY BORDER OF A BRAIN CELL THAT WAS MAGNIFIED WITH RESPECT TO HIMSELF
TO MOUNTAINOUS PROPORTIONS. HE MIGHT BE ASKED NEXT TO MAKE HIS TEST
INSIDE, ACTUALLY INSIDE, SUCH A CELL. AND IF HE DID -- AND IF HE FAILED
-- UNDER WHAT BLANKET OF ARGUMENT AND EXCUSE COULD HE HIDE FROM THE FACT
THAT HIS WORK WAS WRONG AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN WRONG?

 

  HE WAS ANGRY, SURELY, AT BEING THRUST INTO THIS UNCOMFORTABLE CORNER
BY CIRCUMSTANCE AND NOT AT KONEV PARTICULARLY.

 

  HE WAS AWARE OF BORANOVA WAITING FOR HIM TO SAY SOMETHING AND OF KONEV
MAINTAINING HIS INCANDESCENT STARE.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "IF I DETECT SIGNALS, I WILL DETECT THEM FROM ALL
SIDES. EXCEPT FOR THE CAPILLARY WE HAVE JUST LEFT, WE'RE SURROUNDED BY
UNCOUNTED NUMBERS OF NEURONS."

 

  "BUT SOME ARE CLOSER THAN OTHERS," SAID KONEV, "AND ONE OR TWO WOULD
BE CLOSEST OF ALL. CAN'T YOU DETECT THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE SIGNALS
WILL BE THE STRONGEST? WE CAN HOME IN ON THAT SIGNAL."

 

  "MY RECEIVING DEVICE ISN'T EQUIPPED TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS."

 

  "AH! THEN AMERICANS, TOO, MAKE USE OF DEVICES THAT ARE EQUIPPED FOR
SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND DO NOT PREPARE FOR EMERGENCY NEEDS. IT IS NOT
MERELY THE IGNORANT SOVIETS WHO --"

 

  "YURI!" SAID BORANOVA STERNLY.

 

  KONEV SWALLOWED. "I SUPPOSE YOU'LL TELL ME I'M CONFRONTATIONAL AGAIN.
IN THAT CASE, NATALYA, YOU TELL HIM TO THINK OF A WAY OF DEVISING
SOMETHING THAT WILL TELL HIM THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE STRONGEST
SIGNALS ARE COMING."

 

  "PLEASE, ALBERT, MAKE THE ATTEMPT," SAID BORANOVA. "IF YOU FAIL, WE
SHALL JUST HAVE TO BLUNDER OUR WAY THROUGH THIS COLLAGEN JUNGLE AND HOPE
WE COME UPON SOMETHING BEFORE TOO LONG."

 

  "WE'RE BLUNDERING ONWARD EVEN AS WE SPEAK," PUT IN DEZHNEV ALMOST
CHEERFULLY, "BUT I STILL SEE NOTHING."

 

  STILL ANGRY, MORRISON ACTIVATED HIS COMPUTER AND PUT IT INTO THE BRAIN
WAVE RECEPTION MODE. THE SCREEN FLICKERED, BUT IT WAS ONLY NOISE --
THOUGH THE NOISE WAS MORE PROMINENT THAN IT HAD BEEN WITHIN THE
CAPILLARY.

 

  UNTIL NOW, HE HAD ALWAYS USED LEADS THAT INVOLVED MICROPOSITIONING
INSIDE A NERVE. WHERE WAS HE TO PUT THE LEADS NOW? HE HAD NO NERVE TO
PUT THEM INTO -- OR, RATHER, HE WAS ALREADY INSIDE THE BRAIN, WHICH MADE
THE WHOLE MATTER OF POSITIONING ANOMALOUS. PERHAPS, THOUGH, IF HE LET
THE LEADS (MADE AS STIFF AS POSSIBLE) RISE IN THE AIR AND SPREAD APART
LIKE A PAIR OF ANTENNAE, THEY MIGHT PLAY THE PART. AT THEIR PRESENT
SIZE, THE SPREAD WOULD BE TINY AND COULD SCARCELY BE USEFUL BUT --

 

  HE DOUBLED AND REDOUBLED THE LEADS AND THEY STOOD UP IN LONG LOOPS,
LOOKING VERY MUCH LIKE THE INSECT ANTENNAE THAT HAD FIRST GIVEN THEM
THEIR NAMES. HE THEN FOCUSED AND SHARPENED RECEPTION AS WELL AS HE COULD
AND THE FLICKERING ON THE SCREEN SUDDENLY BROKE INTO DEEP NARROW WAVES
-- BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT. INVOLUNTARILY, HE LET OUT A CRY.

 

  "WHAT HAPPENED?" SAID BORANOVA, STARTLED.

 

  "I RECEIVED SOMETHING. JUST A FLASH. BUT IT'S GONE."

 

  "TRY AGAIN."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP. "LISTEN. ALL OF YOU. QUIET. WORKING THIS THING IS
DIFFICULT AND I MANAGE BEST WHEN I CAN CONCENTRATE ENTIRELY. UNDERSTOOD?
NO NOISE. NOTHING."

 

  "WHAT WAS IT YOU RECEIVED?" SAID KONEV SOFTLY.

 

  "WHAT?"

 

  "LIKE A FLASH. YOU RECEIVED SOMETHING LIKE A FLASH. MAY WE KNOW WHAT
IT WAS?"

 

  "NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I RECEIVED. I WANT TO LISTEN AGAIN." HE LOOKED
BEHIND HIM TO THE LEFT. "NATALYA, I'M IN NO POSITION TO GIVE ORDERS, BUT
YOU ARE. I AM NOT TO BE DISTURBED BY ANYONE, PARTICULARLY BY YURI."

 

  "WE WILL ALL BE QUIET," SAID BORANOVA. "PROCEED, ALBERT. -- YURI, NOT
ONE WORD."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED SHARPLY TO HIS LEFT, FOR THERE HAD BEEN A SOFT TOUCH
ON HIS HAND. KALIININ WAS LOOKING AT HIM KEENLY AND THERE WAS A SMALL
SMILE ON HER FACE. SHE MOUTHED WORDS IN AN EXAGGERATED FASHION AND HE
MANAGED TO CATCH THE RUSSIAN: "PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM. SHOW HIM! SHOW
HIM!"

 

  HER EYES SEEMED TO GLITTER. MORRISON COULD NOT HELP BUT SMILE WARMLY
IN RESPONSE. SHE MIGHT BE MOTIVATED ENTIRELY BY A DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE
AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD ABANDONED HER, BUT HE ENJOYED THE LOOK OF
ASSURANCE AND FAITH THAT WAS PRESENT IN HER EYES.

 

  (HOW LONG AGO HAD IT BEEN SINCE A WOMAN HAD LOOKED AT HIM WITH PRIDE
AND WITH TRUST IN HIS ABILITIES? HOW MANY YEARS AGO HAD IT BEEN SINCE
BRENDA HAD LOST HERS?)

 

  A SPASM OF SELF-PITY SHOOK HIM AND HE HAD TO WAIT FOR A MOMENT.

 

  BACK TO THE DEVICE. HE TRIED TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD, SHUT OUT HIS
CONDITION, THINK ONLY OF HIS COMPUTER, ONLY OF THE TINY FLUCTUATIONS IN
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD PRODUCED BY THE INTERCHANGE OF SODIUM AND
POTASSIUM IONS ACROSS THE NEURONIC MEMBRANE.

 

  THE SCREEN FLASHED AGAIN, STEADIED, AND RESOLVED INTO A PATTERN OF LOW
PEAKS AND VALLEYS. CAREFULLY, BARELY DARING TO TOUCH THE KEYS, MORRISON
THREW IN AN EXPANSION DIRECTIVE. THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS SPREAD OUT, THE
EDGES SLIDING OFF THE SCREEN. ON THE SINGLE PEAK AND VALLEY LEFT
REMAINING, THERE WAS A FUZZY SMALLER WIGGLE.

 

  IT'S RECORDING THE WAVES, HE THOUGHT, AFRAID TO SAY SO, AFRAID EVEN TO
THINK IT WITH ANY INTENSITY, LEST THE SLIGHTEST PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
EFFECT SUFFICE TO BLANK IT OUT.

 

  THE MINOR WIGGLE -- THE SKEPTIC WAVES, AS HE CALLED THEM -- WENT OUT
OF FOCUS AND BACK IN, NEVER QUITE SHARPENING.

 

  MORRISON WASN'T SURPRISED. HE MIGHT BE DETECTING THE FIELDS OF A
NUMBER OF CELLS THAT DIDN'T QUITE DUPLICATE EACH OTHER. THERE WAS ALSO
THE INSULATING EFFECT OF THE PLASTIC WALL OF THE SHIP. THERE WAS THE
ETERNAL SHAKING OF BROWNIAN MOTION. THERE MIGHT EVEN BE THE INTERFERING
CHARGE OF ATOM GROUPINGS OUTSIDE THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD.

 

  THE WONDER WAS THAT HE HAD GOTTEN WAVES AT ALL.

 

  SLOWLY HE MADE HAND CONTACT WITH THE ANTENNAE -- SLID HIS FINGERS UP
AND DOWN, FIRST ONE HAND, THEN THE OTHER, THEN BOTH IN UNISON, THEN BOTH
IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. THEN HE BENT THE ANTENNAE GENTLY, THIS WAY AND
THAT. THERE WERE SHARPENING AND FUZZING OF THE SKEPTIC WAVES, BUT HE
DIDN'T KNOW, FOR CERTAIN, EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING THAT RESULTED IN THE
SHARPENING.

 

  AND THEN, AT A CERTAIN POINT, THE TINY WAVES SHARPENED ACUTELY. A
LITTLE TO ONE DIRECTION AND ANOTHER THEY FUZZED, BUT IN ONE PARTICULAR
DIRECTION THEY WERE SHARP. HE TRIED TO KEEP HIS HANDS FROM TREMBLING.

 

  "ARKADY," HE SAID.

 

  "YES, MY AMERICAN MAGICIAN," SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  "CURVE LEFT AND A LITTLE UPWARD. I DON'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH."

 

  "I'LL HAVE TO CURVE AROUND THE FIBERS."

 

  "CURVE SLOWLY. TOO FAST AND I'LL LOSE THE FOCUS."

 

  MORRISON FOUGHT TO KEEP HIS EYES FROM FLICKERING LEFTWARD TOWARD
KALIININ. JUST ONE LOOK AT HER FACE AND ONE INEVITABLE THOUGHT OF HER
PRETTINESS WOULD BE DISTRACTION ENOUGH TO FUZZ OUT THE SCREEN. EVEN THE
THOUGHT OF DISTRACTION WAS ITSELF DISTRACTING ENOUGH FOR THE THOUGHT
WAVE TO FLICKER.

 

  DEZHNEV WAS CURVING THE SHIP IN THE GENTLE ARC THAT WAS ALL THAT THE
OFFSET MOTORS WOULD MANAGE AND SLOWLY MORRISON SHIFTED THE ANTENNAE TO
SUIT. OCCASIONALLY HE MUTTERED A BRIEF WHISPERED DIRECTION: "UP AND
RIGHT," "DOWN," "A LITTLE LEFT."

 

  FINALLY HE GASPED, "STRAIGHT AHEAD."

 

  IT SHOULD GET EASIER, HE THOUGHT, AS THEY GOT CLOSER, BUT HE COULDN'T
RELAX UNTIL A NEURON WAS ACTUALLY IN SIGHT. AND, THROUGH THE OBSCURING
COLLAGEN THICKET, THAT WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE UNTIL THEY WERE NEARLY ON
TOP OF IT.

 

  CONCENTRATING ON ONLY ONE SUBJECT WAS AS TIRING AS CLENCHING A MUSCLE
AND LEAVING IT CLENCHED. HE HAD TO INTRODUCE JUST A BIT OF QUICK
VARIATION. HE HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE, BUT SOMETHING NEUTRAL,
SOMETHING THAT WOULD, FOR A WHILE, LEAVE HIS MIND UNCLENCHED. SO HE
THOUGHT OF HIS BROKEN FAMILY BECAUSE HE HAD THOUGHT OF THEM SO OFTEN
THAT THE IMAGE HAD FADED AND LOST EFFECT SOMEHOW. IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH
THAT WAS GROWING BENT AND GRAY AND HE COULD SNAP OUT OF IT QUICKLY AND
RETURN TO THE SINGLE-MINDED CONTEMPLATION OF THE SKEPTIC WAVES.

 

  THEN -- WITHOUT WARNING AND OVERWHELMINGLY -- ANOTHER THOUGHT INVADED
HIS MIND. IT WAS A SHARP MENTAL PICTURE OF SOPHIA KALIININ, LOOKING
YOUNGER, PRETTIER, AND HAPPIER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEMED TO HIM IN THE
SHORT TIME HE HAD KNOWN HER. AND WITH THAT PICTURE CAME A TUMBLING OF
LOVE AND FRUSTRATION AND JEALOUSY THAT LEFT HIM WEAK.

 

  HE HAD NOT BEEN CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF ANY OF THESE FEELINGS, BUT WHO
KNEW WHAT UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS MIGHT BE HIDDEN THERE IN HIS
OWN BRAIN CELLS? KALIININ? DID HE FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT HER? SO QUICKLY?
OR WAS IT THE ABNORMAL TENSIONS OF THIS FANTASTIC VOYAGE INTO THE BRAIN
THAT HAD BROUGHT ABOUT FANTASTIC RESPONSES?

 

  IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT HE NOTICED THAT THE SCREEN HAD FUZZED OUT
COMPLETELY. HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOUT A WARNING TO DEZHNEV TO STOP THE
MOTORS WHILE HE CONCENTRATED AND TRIED TO RECAPTURE THE WAVES WHEN
DEZHNEV'S VOICE BOOMED OUT.

 

  "THERE IT IS, ALBERT. YOU GUIDED US TO THE CELL LIKE A BLOODHOUND.
CONGRATULATIONS!"

 

  "ALSO," SAID BORANOVA, GAZING AT KONEV'S LOWERING COUNTENANCE,
"CONGRATULATIONS TO YURI FOR COMING UP WITH THE IDEA AND PERSUADING
ALBERT TO MAKE THE EFFORT."

 

  KONEV'S FACE RELAXED AND DEZHNEV SAID, "BUT NOW, HOW DO WE GET INIDE?"

 

  56.

 

  MORRISON STARED AT THE VISTA AHEAD WITH INTEREST. WHAT HE SAW WAS A
VAST RIDGED WALL STRETCHING UP AND DOWN, RIGHT AND LEFT, AS FAR AS THE
SHIP'S LIGHT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SEE. THE RIDGES WERE THEMSELVES BROKEN
UP INTO DOMES SO THAT, ON CLOSER INSPECTION, THE WALL SEEMED TO BE A
CHECKERBOARD WITH EACH SQUARE BULGING OUTWARD. THERE WERE RAGGED
EXTENSIONS JUTTING OUTWARD BETWEEN THE BULGES, LIKE THICK, SHORT, AND
BRANCHING ROPES THAT GAVE THE WALL AN APPEARANCE OF BEING TATTERED.

 

  MORRISON, WITH SOME EFFORT, ALLOWED FOR HIS OWN MINIATURIZATION AND
GRASPED THE FACT THAT THE BULGES WERE THE ENDS OF MOLECULES (OF
PHOSPHOLIPIDS, HE ASSUMED) THAT MADE UP THE CELL MEMBRANE. HE REALIZED
WITH SOME DISMAY JUST WHAT IT MEANT FOR THE SHIP TO BE THE SIZE OF A
GLUCOSE MOLECULE. THE CELL WAS AN ENORMOUS OBJECT; BY PRESENT SHIP
MEASURE, IT MUST BE MANY KILOMETERS ACROSS.

 

  KONEV HAD BEEN STARING AT THE CELL MEMBRANE ALSO, BUT EMERGED FROM HIS
THOUGHTFUL CONTEMPLATION SOONER THAN MORRISON DID.

 

  "I'M NOT SURE," SAID KONEV, "THAT THIS IS A BRAIN CELL -- OR, AT
LEAST, A NEURON."

 

  "WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE?" SAID DEZHNEV. "WE'RE IN THE BRAIN AND THAT'S A
CELL."

 

  KONEV MADE NO VISIBLE ATTEMPT TO SMOTHER THE DISGUST IN HIS EXPRESSION
AS HE SAID, "THERE IS MORE THAN ONE KIND OF BRAIN CELL. THE NEURON IS
THE IMPORTANT CELL, THE CHIEF AGENT OF THE MIND. THERE ARE TEN BILLION
OF THEM IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. THERE ARE ALSO SOME TEN TIMES AS MANY GLIAL
CELLS OF SEVERAL KINDS, WHICH SERVE SUPPORTING AND SUBSIDIARY FUNCTIONS.
THEY ARE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN THE NEURONS. ON THE BASIS OF CHANCE,
THEN, IT IS TEN TO ONE THAT THIS IS A GLIA. THE THOUGHT WAVES ARE IN THE
NEURONS."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE CAN'T BE GUIDED SIMPLY BY CHANCE, YURI. CAN YOU
TELL IN SOME DEFINITIVE WAY WHETHER THIS IS GLIA OR A NEURON WITHOUT
INVOLVING STATISTICS?"

 

  "NOT JUST BY LOOKING AT IT, NO. FROM THIS SIZE, ALL I SEE IS A SMALL
SECTION OF A CELL MEMBRANE AND IN SUCH A CASE ONE CELL LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER. WE'LL HAVE TO BECOME LARGER AND GET A MORE PANORAMIC VIEW. I
PRESUME WE CAN BECOME LARGER NOW, NATALYA. AFTER ALL, WE'RE THROUGH WHAT
YOU CALLED THE COLLAGEN JUNGLE."

 

  "WE CAN DEMINIATURIZE, IF NECESSARY," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT INCREASING
SIZE IS MORE TEDIOUS AND RISKY THAN DECREASING IT. AN INCREASE MEANS THE
GENERATION OF HEAT AND MUST BE DONE SLOWLY. IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE?"

 

  KONEV SAID TARTLY, "WE MIGHT TRY ALBERT'S INSTRUMENT AGAIN. ALBERT,
CAN YOU TELL US IF THE SKEPTIC WAVES YOU CAN DETECT ARE COMING FROM
STRAIGHT AHEAD OR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION?"

 

  MORRISON HESITATED. BEFORE HIS INSTRUMENT HAD FUZZED OUT AT A TIME
JUST BEFORE THE CELL HAD BEEN SIGHTED, THERE HAD BEEN THE KALIININ
VISION AND HE DIDN'T WANT IT BACK. IT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING, TOO
UPSETTING. SURELY, IF HIS MIND HID AND SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS, IT WAS
BECAUSE THEY WERE BETTER HIDDEN AND SUPPRESSED.

 

  HE SAID UNCERTAINLY, "I'M NOT SURE --"

 

  "TRY IT," SAID KONEV AND ALL FOUR SOVIETS WERE NOW LOOKING AT MORRISON
EARNESTLY.

 

  WITH AN INWARD SHRUG, MORRISON PUT HIS COMPUTER INTO ACTION. AFTER
SOME CONSIDERATION, HE SAID, "I GET THE WAVES, YURI, BUT NOT AS STRONGLY
AS I DID ON THE WAY HERE."

 

  "DO THEY GET STRONGER IN ANOTHER DIRECTION?"

 

  "SLIGHTLY, FROM A MORE UPWARD DIRECTION, BUT I MUST WARN YOU AGAIN
THAT THE DIRECTIONAL ABILITIES OF MY DEVICE ARE VERY PRIMITIVE."

 

  "YES, LIKE THIS SHIP YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT. -- HERE IS WHAT IT SEEMS TO
ME HAS HAPPENED, NATALYA. COMING HERE, WE WERE ABLE TO DETECT A NEURON
DIRECTLY ABOVE THE TOP OF A GLIA THAT LAY BEFORE IT. WHEN HE SAW THE
GLIA, ARKADY NATURALLY STEERED FOR IT AND ITS BULK NOW MASKS THE NEURON
AND WE GET THE THOUGHT WAVES MORE DIMLY."

 

  "IN THAT CASE," SAID BORANOVA, "WE MUST GO OVER THE GLIA TO THE
NEURON."

 

  "AND IN THAT CASE," SAID KONEV, "I SAY AGAIN THAT WE MUST
DEMINIATURIZE. AT OUR PRESENT GLUCOSE SIZE, THE DISTANCE WE MUST PASS IN
MOVING OVER THE GLIA MAY WELL PROVE TO BE A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND
FIFTY KILOMETERS. IF WE INCREASE IN LENGTH TEN TIMES, SAY TO THE SIZE
AND MASS OF A SMALL PROTEIN MOLECULE, WE WOULD REDUCE THE APPARENT
DISTANCE TO MERELY TEN OR FIFTEEN KILOMETERS."

 

  KALIININ SAID IN AN ABSTRACTED VOICE, AS THOUGH WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY
BORE NO RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT HAD JUST BEEN SAID, "WE WILL HAVE TO BE OUR
PRESENT SIZE TO GET INTO THE NEURON, NATALYA."

 

  AND, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, AS THOUGH DISENGAGING HIMSELF FROM THE
POSSIBILITY OF DIRECTLY ANSWERING THE REMARK, KONEV SAID, "OF COURSE.
ONCE WE REACH THE NEURON, WE READJUST OUR SIZE TO WHATEVER SEEMS BEST."

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED AND SEEMED LOST IN HER OWN THOUGHT.

 

  KONEV SAID WITH UNACCUSTOMED GENTLENESS, "NATALYA, WE'LL HAVE TO
CHANGE SIZE EVENTUALLY. WE CAN'T STAY GLUCOSE SIZE FOREVER."

 

  "I HATE TO DEMINIATURIZE OFTENER THAN I MUST," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "BUT WE MUST IN THIS CASE, NATALYA. WE CANNOT SPEND HOURS CRUISING
ALONG A CELL MEMBRANE. AND DEMINIATURIZING TENFOLD AT THIS STAGE
INVOLVED A VERY LOW ABSOLUTE ENERGY CHANGE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "IS IT THAT STARTING THE DEMINIATURIZING PROCESS MIGHT
INITIATE AN UNCONTROLLED AND EXPLOSIVE CONTINUATION?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR INTUITION, ALBERT.
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT MINIATURIZATION THEORY, YOU MANAGE TO
GRASP THE POINT. ONCE STARTED, IT IS SAFEST TO ALLOW THE
DEMINIATURIZATION TO CONTINUE. STOPPING IT INVOLVES A CERTAIN RISK."

 

  "SO DOES REMAINING AT GLUCOSE SIZE FOR HOURS LONGER THAN WE NEED,"
SAID KONEV.

 

  "TRUE," SAID BORANOVA, NODDING HER HEAD.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "SHALL WE PUT IT TO A VOTE AND COME TO A PEOPLE'S
DEMOCRATIC DECISION?"

 

  AT THIS, BORANOVA'S HEAD SNAPPED UP AND HER DARK EYES SEEMED TO FLASH.
HER HEAVY JAWS SET FIRMLY AND SHE SAID, "NO, ARKADY. IT IS MY
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE DECISION AND I WILL INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE
SHIP." THEN, ABANDONING THE AIR OF MAJESTY, SHE SAID, "OF COURSE YOU CAN
WISH ME WELL."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "AND WHY NOT? IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS WISHING ALL OF
OURSELVES WELL."

 

  BORANOVA BENT OVER HER CONTROLS AND MORRISON GREW QUICKLY TIRED OF
TRYING TO WATCH. HE COULDN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT SHE WAS DOING, WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS DOING IF HE DID SEE IT, AND THERE WAS THE
MUNDANE FACT THAT HIS NECK WAS BEGINNING TO ACHE WITH THE EFFORT TO KEEP
IT TURNED. HE LOOKED FORWARD AND FOUND KONEV PEERING AT HIM OVER HIS
SHOULDER.

 

  "ABOUT THE SKEPTIC WAVE DETECTION," SAID KONEV.

 

  "WHAT ABOUT THE SKEPTIC WAVE DETECTION?" SAID MORRISON.

 

  "WHEN WE WERE MAKING OUR WAY TO THIS CELL THROUGH THE COLLAGEN JUNGLE
--"

 

  "YES YES, WHAT ABOUT IT?"

 

  "DID YOU GET ANY -- IMAGES?"

 

  MORRISON REMEMBERED THAT TEARING VISION OF SOPHIA KALIININ. NOTHING
LIKE IT EXISTED IN HIS MIND NOW. EVEN WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT AS IT HAD
THEN BEEN, IT NOW ROUSED NO RESPONSE. WHATEVER IT WAS IN HIS MIND, IT
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN REACHED ONLY UNDER THE INTENSE STIMULATION OF
CONCENTRATED SKEPTIC WAVES; AND WHATEVER IT WAS, HE WAS NOT GOING TO
DESCRIBE IT TO KONEV -- OR TO ANYONE ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER.

 

  HE TEMPORIZED, "WHY SHOULD I HAVE SENSED ANY IMAGES?"

 

  "BECAUSE YOU DID ON OCCASION WHEN YOU ANALYZED SKEPTIC WAVES AT
NORMAL-SIZE INTENSITIES."

 

  "YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT ANALYSIS DURING MINIATURIZATION WOULD PRODUCE
GREATER INTENSITIES OR POSSESS GREATER IMAGE-PRODUCING POWERS."

 

  "IT'S A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION. BUT DID YOU OR DIDN'T YOU? THE QUESTION
DOESN'T INVOLVE THEORIZING. I'M ASKING ABOUT AN OBSERVATION. DID YOU GET
ANY IMAGES?"

 

  AND MORRISON SIGHED INWARDLY AND SAID, "NO."

 

  KONEV CONTINUED HIS SIDEWISE PEERING (UNDER WHICH MORRISON FELT
HIMSELF GROW A LITTLE RESTLESS AND RATHER MORE THAN A LITTLE IRATE),
THEN SAID SOFTLY, "I DID."

 

  "YOU DID?" MORRISON'S EYES WIDENED IN HONEST SURPRISE. THEN, MORE
CAUTIOUSLY, "WHAT DID YOU SENSE?"

 

  "NOT MUCH, BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN IT MORE CLEARLY. YOU
WERE ACTUALLY HOLDING AND MANIPULATING YOUR DETECTOR AND IT IS PROBABLY
MORE ADAPTED TO YOUR BRAIN THAN MINE."

 

  "JUST WHAT WAS IT YOU GOT? CAN YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT AT ALL?"

 

  "A KIND OF FLICKER THAT MOVED INTO AND OUT OF AWARENESS. IT SEEMED TO
ME THAT I SAW THREE HUMAN FIGURES, ONE LARGER THAN THE OTHERS."

 

  "AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT?"

 

  "WELL, SHAPIROV HAD A DAUGHTER WHOM HE ADORED AND SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN
WHOM HE ALSO ADORED. I IMAGINE THAT IN HIS COMA HE MAY HAVE BEEN
THINKING OF THEM, OR REMEMBERING THEM, OR BEING UNDER THE DELUSION THAT
HE WAS SEEING THEM. WHO KNOWS WHAT GOES ON IN A COMA?"

 

  "DO YOU KNOW HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS GRANDCHILDREN? DID YOU RECOGNIZE
THEM?"

 

  "I WAS SEEING THEM, AS IT WERE, THROUGH TRANSLUCENT GLASS IN THE
TWILIGHT. IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO SENSE THREE FIGURES." HE SOUNDED
DISAPPOINTED. "I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD SEE IT MORE CLEARLY."

 

  MORRISON, THINKING HARD, SAID, "I NEITHER SAW, NOR SENSED, ANYTHING
LIKE THAT."

 

  KONEV SAID, "OF COURSE, THINGS SHOULD BE SHARPER ONCE WE ARE INSIDE A
NEURON. IT IS NOT IMAGES WE MUST SENSE, IN ANY CASE. WE WANT TO HEAR
WORDS."

 

  "I'VE NEVER HEARD WORDS," SAID MORRISON, SHAKING HIS HEAD.

 

  "OF COURSE NOT," SAID KONEV, "SINCE YOU WORKED WITH ANIMALS WHO DON'T
USE WORDS."

 

  "TRUE," SAID MORRISON. "JUST THE SAME, I ONCE MANAGED TO RUN SOME
TESTS ON A HUMAN BEING, THOUGH I NEVER REPORTED IT. I SENSED NO WORDS
THEN OR IMAGES EITHER."

 

  KONEV SHRUGGED IT OFF.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU KNOW, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MIGHT BE NATURAL
FOR SHAPIROV'S MIND TO BE FULL OF FAMILY -- IF WE ACCEPT YOUR
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU SENSED. WHAT WOULD THE CHANCES BE
THAT HE WOULD BE THINKING OF SOME ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF MINIATURIZATION
MATHEMATICS?"

 

  "HE WAS A PHYSICIST. EVEN HIS FAMILY CAME SECOND TO THAT. IF WE CAN
SENSE WORDS OUT OF THOSE SKEPTIC WAVES, THEY'LL BE WORDS DEALING WITH
PHYSICS."

 

  "YOU THINK THAT, DO YOU?"

 

  "I AM POSITIVE."

 

  THE TWO FELL QUIET AND FOR A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE
SHIP. THEN BORANOVA SAID, "I'VE DEMINIATURIZED THE SHIP TO PROTEIN SIZE
AND I HAVE BROUGHT THE PROCESS TO A HALT."

 

  A MOMENT PASSED AND THEN DEZHNEV, WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED TIGHTNESS TO
HIS THROATY VOICE, SAID, "ARE THINGS ALL RIGHT, NATASHA?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THE MERE FACT THAT YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION, ARKADY,
IS AN ANSWER IN THE POSITIVE. DEMINIATURIZATION HAS STOPPED WITHOUT
INCIDENT."

 

  SHE SMILED, BUT THERE WAS A DEFINITE TRACE OF PERSPIRATION GLISTENING
AT HER HAIRLINE.

 

  57.

 

  THE SURFACE OF THE GLIAL CELL STILL STRETCHED OUT AS FAR AS THE EYE
COULD SEE INTO THE DIMNESS BEYOND THE REACH OF THE SHIP'S LIGHT, BUT IT
HAD CHANGED IN CHARACTER. THE DOMES AND RIDGES HAD FADED OUT INTO A FINE
TEXTURE. THE ROPES THAT HAD EXTENDED FROM BETWEEN THE DOMES HAD BECOME
THREADS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE AS THE SHIP SPED ALONG THE SURFACE.

 

  MORRISON'S ATTENTION WAS, FOR THE MOST PART, ON HIS COMPUTER, AS HE
WATCHED TO SEE THAT THE SKEPTIC WAVES DID NOT DECLINE IN INTENSITY, BUT,
PERIODICALLY, HE COULD NOT HELP BUT DRIFT AWAY FROM THAT AND GAZE AT THE
PANORAMA OUTSIDE.

 

  OCCASIONALLY, THERE WOULD EMERGE FROM THE SURFACE OF THE CELL THE
TYPICAL DENDRITIC PROCESSES OF A NERVE CELL -- EVEN ONE THAT WAS MERELY
A SUBSIDIARY GLIAL CELL. THEY BRANCHED AND SUB-BRANCHED LIKE A TREE IN
WINTER, GROWING OUT OF THE CELL MEMBRANE.

 

  EVEN AT THE NEW AND LARGER SIZE OF THE SHIP, THE DENDRITES WERE LARGE
WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM THE CELL. THEY WERE LIKE TREE TRUNKS, WHICH,
HOWEVER, NARROWED RAPIDLY AND WERE CLEARLY FLEXIBLE. LACKING THE
RIGIDITY OF THE CARTILAGE FIBERS, THEY SWAYED IN THE EDDIES SET UP BY
THE SHIP'S PROGRESS THROUGH THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID. THEY SWAYED,
INDEED, AT THE SHIP'S APPROACH AND DEZHNEV RARELY HAD TO DO ANYTHING TO
AVOID THEM. THEY WOULD BEND OUT OF LINE AND THE SHIP WOULD PASS THEM
SAFELY.

 

  COLLAGEN FIBERS WERE FEWER IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CELL
AND, THANKS TO THE LARGER SIZE OF THE SHIP, WERE MUCH THINNER AND MORE
FRAGILE. ON ONE OCCASION, DEZHNEV EITHER DID NOT SEE ONE LOOMING
DIRECTLY AHEAD OF THE SHIP OR DID NOT CARE THAT IT WAS. THE SHIP BRUSHED
PAST IT IN A WAY THAT BROUGHT IT JUST OUTSIDE MORRISON'S SEAT. HE
FLINCHED AT THE GRATING COLLISION, BUT THE SHIP WAS IN NO WAY DAMAGED.
IT WAS THE COLLAGEN FIBER THAT BENT, THEN SNAPPED AND DANGLED FREE.
MORRISON'S HEAD TURNED AND HIS EYES FOLLOWED THE BROKEN FIBER FOR THE
SECOND OR SO THAT IT REMAINED IN VIEW BEFORE FLOATING AWAY.

 

  BORANOVA MUST HAVE SEEN IT, TOO, AND WATCHED MORRISON'S REACTION, FOR
SHE SAID, "THERE'S NO REASON FOR CONCERN. THERE ARE TRILLIONS OF THOSE
FIBERS SCATTERED THROUGH THE BRAIN, SO THAT ONE MORE OR LESS DOESN'T
MATTER. BESIDES, THEY HEAL -- EVEN IN A BRAIN AS BADLY DAMAGED AS POOR
SHAPIROV'S."

 

  "I SUPPOSE SO," SAID MORRISON, "YET I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK WE ARE
CRASHING WITHOUT ANY RIGHT THROUGH AN INFINITELY DELICATE MECHANISM NOT
MEANT FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INVASION."

 

  "I APPRECIATE YOUR FEELING," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT HARDLY ANYTHING IN
THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO BEING BY GEOLOGICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES WITH ANY APPARENT PRE-VISION OF HUMAN INTERFERENCE.
HUMANITY DOES A GREAT DEAL OF WRONG TO EARTH AND TO LIFE, SOME OF IT
WITTINGLY. -- INCIDENTALLY, I'M THIRSTY. ARE YOU?"

 

  "DEFINITELY," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "YOU'LL FIND A CUP IN THE LITTLE RECESS UNDER YOUR RIGHT ARMREST. PASS
IT BACK."

 

  SHE DISTRIBUTED WATER TO ALL FIVE, SAYING MATTER-OF-FACTLY, "THERE'S
NO SHORTAGE OF WATER, SO IF YOU WANT SECONDS, SAY SO."

 

  DEZHNEV LOOKED AT HIS CUP DISTASTEFULLY, WHILE KEEPING ONE HAND ON THE
CONTROLS. HE SNIFFED AT IT AND SAID, "MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THERE IS
NO DRINK LIKE PURE WATER, PROVIDED ONE REALIZES THAT IT IS ALCOHOL THAT
IS THE PURIFYING AGENT.'"

 

  "YES, ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA. "I AM QUITE SURE YOUR FATHER PURIFIED
HIS WATER FREQUENTLY, BUT HERE ON THE SHIP, WITH YOUR HANDS ON THE
CONTROLS, YOU WILL HAVE YOUR WATER UNPURIFIED."

 

  "WE MUST ALL GO THROUGH PRIVATIONS NOW AND THEN," SAID DEZHNEV, WHO
THEN DOWNED HIS WATER AND MADE A FACE.

 

  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TASTE OF THE WATER THAT CAUSED KALIININ TO
FUMBLE BETWEEN HER LEGS. IT TOOK A MOMENT FOR MORRISON TO REALIZE THAT
IT WAS HER TURN TO URINATE AND HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW AND
WAITED TO SEE IF ANOTHER COLLAGEN FIBER MIGHT GO FLYING.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I SUPPOSE, STRICTLY SPEAKING, IT'S LUNCHTIME, BUT WE
CAN DO WITHOUT. STILL --"

 

  "STILL WHAT?" ASKED DEZHNEV. "A GOOD PLATE OF PIPING HOT BORSCHT WITH
SOUR CREAM?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHAT I HAVE SMUGGLED IN AGAINST REGULATIONS ARE BITS
OF CHOCOLATE -- HIGH-CALORIE, ZERO-FIBER."

 

  KALIININ, WHO HAD DISPOSED OF HER SMALL DAMP PAPER TOWEL AND WAS
SHAKING HER HANDS TO DRY THEM, SAID, "IT WILL ROT OUR TEETH."

 

  "NOT IMMEDIATELY," SAID BORANOVA, "AND YOU CAN RINSE YOUR MOUTH WITH A
LITTLE WATER TO REDUCE THE SUGAR RESIDUE. WHO WANTS ONE?"

 

  FOUR HANDS WENT UP, KALIININ'S NOT THE LAST. MORRISON WELCOMED HIS
GLADLY. HE WAS FOND OF CHOCOLATE IN ANY CASE AND SUCKED AT IT TO MAKE IT
LAST LONGER. THE TASTE REMINDED HIM POIGNANTLY OF HIS BOYHOOD IN THE
OUTSKIRTS OF MUNCIE.

 

  THE CHOCOLATE WAS GONE WHEN KONEV SAID TO MORRISON IN A LOW VOICE,
"HAVE YOU SENSED ANYTHING WHILE WE'VE BEEN SKIMMING PAST THE GLIAL
CELL?"

 

  "NO," SAID MORRISON. (HE HADN'T.) "HAVE YOU?"

 

  "I THOUGHT I DID. THE PHRASE 'GREEN FIELDS' CROSSED MY MIND."

 

  MORRISON COULD NOT PREVENT HIMSELF FROM SAYING "HMM" AND FOR A WHILE
REMAINED LOST IN THOUGHT.

 

  "WELL?" SAID KONEV.

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "PHRASES GO THROUGH ONE'S MIND ALL THE TIME. YOU
HEAR SOMETHING OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EAR, SO TO SPEAK, AND SOMETIME
LATER IT PENETRATES YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS; OR SOME STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS
THOUGHTS INVADE YOUR MIND AND ONE PHRASE SURFACES; OR YOU CAN HAVE AN
AUDITORY HALLUCINATION OF SOME SORT."

 

  "IT CROSSED MY MIND WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR INSTRUMENT AND
CONCENTRATING."

 

  "YOU WANTED TO BE AWARE OF SOMETHING, I SUPPOSE, AND SOMETHING
PROMPTLY OBLIGED BY FLITTING THROUGH YOUR MIND IN RESPONSE. YOU GET THE
SAME EFFECT IN DREAMS."

 

  "NO. THIS WAS REAL."

 

  "HOW CAN YOU TELL, YURI? -- I DIDN'T SENSE ANY SUCH THING. DID ANYONE
ELSE SENSE IT, DO YOU SUPPOSE?"

 

  "THEY WOULDN'T. NO ONE ELSE WAS CONCENTRATING ON YOUR MACHINE. PERHAPS
NO ONE ELSE IN THE SHIP HAD A BRAIN SUFFICIENTLY LIKE YOURS TO SENSE ON
YOUR WAVELENGTH, SO TO SPEAK."

 

  "YOU'RE JUST GUESSING. BESIDES, WHAT DOES THE PHRASE MEAN?"

 

  "GREEN FIELDS? SHAPIROV HAD A HOUSE OUT IN THE COUNTRY. HE WOULD
REMEMBER THE GREEN FIELDS."

 

  "HE MIGHT HAVE MERELY SUPPLIED THE IMAGE. YOU WOULD SUPPLY THE WORDS."

 

  KONEV FROWNED, PAUSED A MOMENT, THEN SAID IN A CLEARLY HOSTILE MANNER,
"WHY ARE YOU SO OPPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING A MESSAGE?"

 

  MORRISON ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE EQUALLY HOSTILE. "BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
BURNED BY REPORTING SUCH SENSE PERCEPTIONS. I'VE BEEN RIDICULED LONG
ENOUGH AND I HAVE BECOME CAUTIOUS. AN IMAGE OF A WOMAN AND TWO CHILDREN
DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING. NEITHER DOES A PHRASE LIKE 'GREEN FIELDS.' IF
YOU REPORT IT, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL IT FROM A SELF-GENERATED IMAGE
OR PHRASE? NOW LISTEN, YURI, A HINT, TO BE USEFUL, MUST, HOWEVER VAGUELY
AND INDIRECTLY, TIE IN WITH THE QUANTUM-RELATIVITY RELATIONSHIP. THAT WE
CAN REPORT. ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT IS NOT COMPELLING; IT WON'T FORCE
BELIEF. IT WILL ONLY SUCCEED IN HURTING US. I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WHAT, THEN, IF YOU SUCCEED IN HEARING SOMETHING VITAL,
SOMETHING THAT BEARS ON OUR PROJECT? WILL YOU PERHAPS KEEP IT TO
YOURSELF?"

 

  "WHY SHOULD I? IF I SENSE SOMETHING IN PHYSICS RELATING TO
MINIATURIZATION, I WOULD LACK THE BACKGROUND TO UNDERSTAND IT AND
KEEPING IT TO MYSELF WOULD GET ME NOWHERE. IF SOME USEFUL RESULT IS
SHARED BETWEEN US, THIS COMPUTER REMAINS MY MACHINE AND IT IS ACTIVATED
BY MY THEORY. I AM THE ONE WHO WILL GET THE MAJOR SHARE OF THE CREDIT. I
WON'T KEEP IT TO MYSELF, YURI. BOTH MY SELF-INTEREST AND MY HONOR AS A
SCIENTIST WILL KEEP ME FROM DOING THAT. -- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?"

 

  "OF COURSE I'LL SHARE WHATEVER I SENSE. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO JUST
NOW."

 

  "I DON'T MEAN 'GREEN FIELDS.' THAT IS NONSENSE. SUPPOSE YOU SENSE
SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT AND I DON'T. MIGHT IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT
THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE A STATE SECRET, AS MINIATURIZATION ITSELF IS?
WOULD YOU THEN TELL ME THAT KNOWLEDGE AND RISK THE WRATH OF YOUR CENTRAL
COORDINATING COMMITTEE."

 

  THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN WHISPERS, HEADS TOGETHER, BUT BORANOVA'S
EARS PICKED UP THE KEY WORD. "POLITICS, GENTLEMEN?" SHE ASKED FROSTILY.

 

  KONEV SAID, "WE'RE DISCUSSING THE POSSIBLE USES OF ALBERT'S
INSTRUMENT, NATALYA. IF I LEARN SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE FROM SHAPIROV'S
SKEPTIC WAVES AND ALBERT DOES NOT, HE THINKS I WILL KEEP IT FROM HIM
UNDER THE EXCUSE THAT IT IS A STATE SECRET."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IT WELL MAY BE."

 

  KONEV SAID MILDLY, "WE NEED ALBERT'S COOPERATION. IT IS HIS MACHINE
AND HIS PROGRAM AND I AM SURE HE KNOWS HOW TO WORK IT AT LESS THAN
PERFECT EFFICIENCY. IF HE IS NOT COMPLETELY ASSURED OF OUR HONESTY AND
GOODWILL, HE MAY ARRANGE TO HAVE US SENSE NOTHING. I AM WILLING TO SHARE
ANYTHING THAT I SENSE IF HE WILL DO THE SAME."

 

  "THE COMMITTEE MAY DISAPPROVE, AS ALBERT HIMSELF POINTED OUT," SAID
BORANOVA.

 

  "LET IT. I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF WITH IT," SAID KONEV.

 

  "I'LL PROVE I LOVE YOU, YURI," INTERPOSED DEZHNEV WITH A CHUCKLE. "I
WON'T QUOTE YOU."

 

  KALIININ SAID, "NATALYA, I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE HONEST WITH ALBERT,
SINCE WE MUST ASK HIM TO BE HONEST WITH US. USING HIS OWN DEVICE WITH
WHICH HE HAS EXPERIENCE, HE IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING
USEFUL THAN WE ARE. A POLICY OF QUID PRO QUO IS LIKELY TO BE FAR MORE TO
OUR ADVANTAGE THAN TO HIS. -- ISN'T THAT SO, ALBERT?"

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "I'VE BEEN THINKING PRECISELY THAT AND WOULD HAVE
MENTIONED IT IF IT LOOKED AS THOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME THAT IT
WAS AGAINST GOVERNMENT POLICY TO BE HONEST WITH ME."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WELL, LET US AWAIT EVENTS." THE TENSION DIED DOWN.

 

  MORRISON REMAINED BUSY WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS, WATCHING HIS MACHINE
ONLY IN ABSTRACTION.

 

  AND THEN DEZHNEV SAID, "THERE'S ANOTHER CELL JUST AHEAD -- A KILOMETER
OR TWO. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MIGHT BE LARGER THAN THE ONE WE'VE BEEN
PASSING. IS THAT A NEURON, YURI?"

 

  KONEV, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IN A BROWN STUDY OF HIS OWN, SNAPPED TO
ATTENTION. "ALBERT, WHAT DOES YOUR MACHINE SAY? IS THAT A NEURON?"

 

  MORRISON WAS ALREADY HANDLING HIS DEVICE. "IT MUST BE," HE SAID. "I'VE
NEVER SEEN THE SKEPTIC WAVES THIS SHARP."

 

  "GOOD!" SAID DEZHNEV. "NOW WHAT?"

 

  58.

 

  KALIININ LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE CELL SURFACE BELOW. SHE SAID,
"NATALYA, WE'LL HAVE TO MINIATURIZE TO GLUCOSE SIZE AGAIN. ARKADY, GET
US IN AMONG THE DENDRITES SO THAT WE CAN GET DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE
CELL BODY."

 

  MORRISON WATCHED THE SURFACE ALSO. THE DENDRITES WERE MUCH MORE
ELABORATE THAN THOSE ON THE GLIA. THE NEAREST ONE BRANCHED AND BRANCHED
AGAIN UNTIL IT LOOKED LIKE A FUZZY FROND VANISHING BEYOND THE REACH OF
SHIP'S LIGHT. OTHERS, FARTHER AWAY, WERE FUZZIER AND SMALLER.

 

  MORRISON SUSPECTED THAT THE FUZZINESS WAS AT LEAST PARTLY THE RESULT
OF BROWNIAN MOTION. SURELY THERE COULDN'T BE MUCH OF THAT, HOWEVER.
PROBABLY EACH FINAL STRAND OF THE BRANCHINGS -- EACH TWIG -- MET A
SIMILAR TWIG OR SOME NEIGHBORING NEURON TO FORM THAT INTIMATE NEAR-TOUCH
CALLED A SYNAPSE. THE WAVERING OF THE TWIG WOULD NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO
BREAK THE CONTACT OR THE BRAIN COULDN'T DO ITS WORK.

 

  DEZHNEV HAD THE SHIP APPROACH THE SURFACE OF THE CELL BODY, SLOWLY
SLITHERING PAST THE NEAREST DENDRITE (HE WAS LEARNING TO HANDLE THE
UNBALANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINES WITH A CERTAIN FINESSE, MORRISON
THOUGHT) -- AND, AS HE DID SO, IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT THE SURFACE OF
THE NEURON WAS CHANGING CHARACTER.

 

  OF COURSE, IT HAD TO, FOR THE SHIP WAS MINIATURIZING AGAIN. THE RIDGES
IN THE CELL SURFACE WERE BECOMING MORE PROMINENT AND WERE DIVIDING INTO
DOMES. BETWEEN THE PHOSPHOLIPID DOMES THE HAIRS WERE BECOMING ROPIER.
RECEPTORS, THOUGHT MORRISON. EACH ONE OF THEM WAS DESIGNED TO LINK ON TO
A PARTICULAR MOLECULE THAT WOULD BE USEFUL TO THE NEURON AND CERTAINLY
GLUCOSE WOULD HE THE MOST USEFUL OF THOSE.

 

  THE DOWNWARD CHANGE WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE RAPID THAN THE UPWARD
CHANGE. ABSORBING ENERGY WAS SIMPLE, WHILE THE ENERGY RELEASE OF
DEMINIATURIZATION WAS DANGEROUS. MORRISON UNDERSTOOD THAT WELL BY NOW.

 

  KALIININ SAID, FROWNING IN CONCERN, "I DON'T KNOW WHICH RECEPTORS ARE
FOR GLUCOSE, BUT A GREAT MANY OF THEM MUST BE. SKIM ACROSS THEM SLOWLY,
ARKADY -- VERY SLOWLY. IF WE'RE CAUGHT, I DON'T WANT TO TEAR LOOSE -- OR
TO TEAR THEM LOOSE, EITHER."

 

  "NO PROBLEM, LITTLE SOPHIE," SAID DEZHNEV. "IF I SHUT OFF THE MOTORS,
THE SHIP STOPS AT ONCE. IT CAN'T PUSH THROUGH THE GIANT ATOMS THAT
SURROUND US AT ALL EASILY. TOO VISCOUS. SO I JUST GIVE IT A TOUCH OF
ENERGY, ENOUGH TO SHOULDER OUR WAY PAST THE MOLECULES OF WATER, AND
WE'LL TIPTOE ACROSS THE RECEPTORS."

 

  "'THROUGH THE TULIPS,'" SAID MORRISON, LOOKING AT KONEV.

 

  "WHAT?" SAID KONEV, LOOKING BOTH ANNOYED AND PUZZLED.

 

  "IT'S A PHRASE THAT WENT THROUGH MY HEAD. THERE'S AN OLD SHOW TUNE
CALLED 'TIP TOE THROUGH THE TULIPS WITH ME,' IN ENGLISH, THE WORDS ARE
--"

 

  "WHAT NONSENSE ARE YOU SPEAKING?" SNAPPED KONEV.

 

  "I'M TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT WHENEVER SOMEONE SAYS 'TIPTOE' TO ME, I
AUTOMATICALLY HEAR THE PHRASE 'THROUGH THE TULIPS' IN MY MIND. IF I
HAPPEN TO BE CONCENTRATING ON MY COMPUTER WHEN SOMEONE SAYS 'TIPTOE,' I
WILL STILL HEAR THE PHRASE IN MY MIND AND IT WILL NOT MEAN THAT I AM
GETTING IT FROM THE SKEPTIC WAVES ON THE COMPUTER. DO YOU TAKE MY
MEANING?"

 

  "YOU'RE TALKING EMPTILY," SAID KONEV. "LEAVE ME ALONE."

 

  BUT HE LOOKED SHAKEN, MORRISON THOUGHT. HE HAD TAKEN THE MEANING.

 

  THEY WERE NOW MOVING PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE OF THE NEURON. THE
RECEPTORS WERE MOVING GENTLY AND MORRISON REALIZED THAT HE COULDN'T TELL
WHICH WERE EMPTY AND WHICH HAD ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO SOME OF THE
MOLECULES MOVING THROUGH THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID WITH THEM.

 

  HE TRIED TO CONCENTRATE ON THOSE MOLECULES. THERE SEEMED TO BE
GLITTERINGS IN THE FLUID WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LIGHT OF THE SHIP'S
BEACON REFLECTED FROM MOLECULES, BUT NONE OF IT SHOWED UP WELL. EVEN THE
SURFACE OF THE CELL MEMBRANE WASN'T ACTUALLY CLEAR IF YOU LOOKED AT IT
DIRECTLY. IT WAS MORE THE SURREALISTIC IMPRESSION OF A SURFACE THAN AN
ACTUAL ONE -- TOO FEW PHOTONS WERE BEING REFLECTED AND TOO FEW WERE
REACHING THEM ON THEIR SMALL SCALE.

 

  STILL, BY THE GLITTER, HE COULD MAKE OUT A KIND OF GRITTINESS IN THE
FLUID THEY WERE PASSING THROUGH (WATER MOLECULES, SURELY) AND AMONG
THEM, NOW AND THEN, SOMETHING WORMY-TWISTING, TURNING, CLOSING UP, THEN
OPENING AGAIN. THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SHIP WAS, OF COURSE,
WITHIN THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD, SO THAT ATOMS AND MOLECULES OF THE
STANDARD-SIZE WORLD WERE CONSTANTLY SHRINKING AS THEY ENTERED -- AND
EXPANDING AGAIN AS THEY LEFT. THE NUMBER OF ATOMS DOING SO MUST BE
ENORMOUS BUT THE ENERGY CHANGE THAT RESULTED, EVEN TOTALED OVER THAT
NUMBER, WERE SMALL ENOUGH SO THAT IT DID NOT DRAIN THE SHIP PERCEPTIBLY,
OR BRING ABOUT SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION, OR DO ANY DAMAGE. -- OR,
AT LEAST, IT SEEMED TO DO NO DAMAGE.

 

  MORRISON TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I DON'T MEAN TO QUESTION YOUR ABILITY, SOPHIA, BUT
PLEASE CHECK AND MAKE SURE THE SHIP HAS THE ELECTRICAL PATTERN OF
GLUCOSE."

 

  "I ASSURE YOU IT DOES," SAID KALIININ.

 

  AND AS THOUGH TO GIVE NOTICE THAT THAT WAS INDEED SO, THE SHIP SEEMED
TO TWIST IN MID-FLUID, JUDGING BY THE SUDDEN SHIFT IN VIEW THROUGH THE
WALLS.

 

  UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS, SUCH A TWIST WOULD HAVE THROWN EVERY PERSON
ON THE SHIP HARD AGAINST THE WALL OR THE SEAT ARM. MASS AND INERTIA,
HOWEVER, WERE AT VIRTUALLY ZERO AND THERE WAS ONLY A FAINT SWAYING,
HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT WHICH THEY ASSOCIATED WITH BROWNIAN
MOTION.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "WE'VE ATTACHED OURSELVES TO A GLUCOSE RECEPTOR."

 

  "GOOD," SAID DEZHNEV. "I'VE TURNED OFF THE MOTOR. NOW WHAT DO WE DO?"

 

  "NOTHING," SAID KALIININ. "WE LET THE CELL DO ITS WORK AND WE WAIT."

 

  THE RECEPTOR DID NOT ACTUALLY MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SHIP. THIS WAS
GOOD, FOR HAD IT COME ANY CLOSER IT WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE
MINIATURIZATION FIELD AND ITS TIP WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED. AS IT WAS, THERE
WAS A CLOSE MEETING OF ELECTRICAL FIELDS ONLY, NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE AND
POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE. THE ATTRACTIONS WERE NOT THE FULL ATTRACTIONS BUT
THE LESSER ONES THAT RESEMBLED HYDROGEN BONDS. IT WAS ENOUGH TO HOLD,
BUT WEAK ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SHIP TO PULL AWAY SOMEWHAT, AS THOUGH IT
WERE CONNECTED TO THE RECEPTOR BY RUBBER BANDS RATHER THAN BY GRAPPLING
HOOKS.

 

  THE RECEPTOR STRETCHED THE LENGTH OF THE SHIP AND WAS IRREGULAR IN
OUTLINE, AS THOUGH IT WERE EMBRACING A PATTERN OF BULGES ALONG THE
PLASTIC HULL. THE HULL WAS SMOOTH AND FEATURELESS TO THE EYE, OF COURSE,
BUT MORRISON WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS AN ELECTRIC FIELD THAT
BULGED IN JUST THE LOCATIONS WHERE THE HYDROXYL GROUPS WOULD BE IN THE
GLUCOPYRANOSE STRUCTURE, THE BULGES TAKING ON JUST THE SHAPES THEY WOULD
IN THE NATURAL MOLECULE.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED OUT AGAIN. THE RECEPTOR VIRTUALLY BLANKED OUT VISION
ON THE SIDE OF THE SHIP ALONG WHICH IT LAY. IF HE LOOKED BEYOND THE
RECEPTOR, HOWEVER, HE COULD SEE A FARTHER STRETCH OF THE NEURON'S
SURFACE, SEEMINGLY WITHOUT END, FOR IT VANISHED BEYOND THE REACH OF THE
SHIP'S LIGHT.

 

  THE NEURONIC SURFACE SEEMED TO BE HEAVING SLIGHTLY AND HE COULD SEE
GREATER DETAIL. AMONG THE REGULAR DOMES OF THE RANK AND FILE OF
PHOSPHOLIPID MOLECULES, HE CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF AN IRREGULAR
MASS, WHICH HE GUESSED TO BE A PROTEIN MOLECULE THAT RAN THROUGH THE
THICKNESS OF THE CELL MEMBRANE. IT WAS TO THESE MOLECULES THAT THE
RECEPTORS WERE ATTACHED, WHICH DID NOT SURPRISE MORRISON. HE KNEW THAT
THE RECEPTORS MUST BE PEPTIDES -- CHAINS OF AMINO ACIDS. THEY WERE PART
OF THE THREAD OF A PROTEIN BACKBONE, STICKING OUTWARD, EACH DIFFERENT
RECEPTOR MADE UP OF DIFFERENT AMINO ACIDS IN A SPECIFIC ORDER SO
DESIGNED AS TO POSSESS AN ELECTRIC FIELD PATTERN MATCHING (IN OPPOSING
ATTRACTIONS AND PHYSICAL SHAPE) THAT OF THE MOLECULE IT WAS DESIGNED TO
PICK UP.

 

  THEN, EVEN AS HE WATCHED, IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE RECEPTORS WERE
MOVING TOWARD HIM. HE COULD SEE THEM NOW IN GREATER NUMBERS AND COULD
ALSO SEE THAT THOSE NUMBERS WERE STILL INCREASING. THE RECEPTORS AND THE
PROTEIN MOLECULES TO WHICH THEY WERE ATTACHED SEEMED TO BE SWIMMING
THROUGH THE PHOSPHOLIPID MOLECULES (WITH A FILM OF CHOLESTEROL MOLECULES
UNDERNEATH, MORRISON KNEW), WHICH OPENED BEFORE AND CLOSED BEHIND.

 

  "SOMETHING'S HAPPENING," SAID MORRISON AS HE FELT THE SHIP'S OWN
MOTION THROUGH THE TINY DRAG OF INERTIA THAT REMAINED TO THEM AT THEIR
THOROUGHLY NEGLIGIBLE MASS.

 

  59.

 

  KONE  SAID, "THE SURFACE IS GATHERING US IN."

 

  DEZHNEV NODDED. "IT LOOKS LIKE ITS DOING THIS." HE HELD UP HIS THICK
AND CALLUSED HAND, CUPPING IT.

 

  "EXACTLY," SAID KONEV. "IT WILL INVAGINATE, MAKE A DEEPER AND DEEPER
CUP, NARROWING THE NECK AND FINALLY CLOSING IT, AND WE WILL BE INSIDE
THE CELL." HE SEEMED QUITE CALM ABOUT IT.

 

  SO WAS MORRISON. THEY WANTED TO BE INSIDE THE CELL AND THIS WAS THE
WAY IT WAS DONE.

 

  THE RECEPTORS CONTINUED COMING TOGETHER, ALONGSIDE EACH ONE OF THEM
SOME MOLECULE -- SOME REAL MOLECULE -- AND IN AMONG THEM THE FEIGNING
MOLECULE OF THE SHIP. THE CELL'S SURFACE, LIKE DEZHNEV'S CUPPED HAND,
CLOSED UPON THEM ENTIRELY AND DREW THEM IN.

 

  "NOW WHAT?" SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  "WE'RE IN A VESICLE INSIDE THE CELL," SAID KALIININ. "IT WILL GROW
MORE ACID AND THE RECEPTOR WILL THEN DETACH ITSELF FROM US. IT AND ALL
THE RECEPTORS WILL THEN RETURN TO THE CELL MEMBRANE."

 

  "AND WE?" PERSISTED DEZHNEV.

 

  "SINCE WE ARE RECOGNIZED BY OUR ELECTRIC FIELD AS A GLUCOSE MOLECULE,"
SAID KALIININ, "THE CELL WILL TRY TO METABOLIZE US -- BREAK US UP INTO
SMALLER FRAGMENTS AND EXTRACT ENERGY FROM US."

 

  EVEN AS SHE SPOKE, THE PEPTIDE RECEPTOR FELL AWAY, UNCOILING.

 

  "IS THAT A GOOD IDEA, HAVING IT METABOLIZE US?" ASKED DEZHNEV.

 

  "IT WON'T," SAID MORRISON. "WE'LL BE ATTACHED TO AN APPROPRIATE ENZYME
MOLECULE WHICH WILL FIND THAT WE DON'T REACT AS EXPECTED. WE WON'T TAKE
ON A PHOSPHATE GROUP, SO IT WILL BE HELPLESS AND WILL PROBABLY RELEASE
US. WE'RE NOT REALLY A GLUCOSE MOLECULE."

 

  "BUT IF THE ENZYME MOLECULE RELEASES US, WON'T ANOTHER ENZYME MOLECULE
OF THE SAME TYPE ATTACH ITSELF TO US AND TRY AGAIN -- AND SO ON
INDEFINITELY."

 

  "NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT," SAID MORRISON, RUBBING HIS CHIN AND
ABSENTLY NOTICING THE BRISTLES GROWN SINCE HIS MORNING SHAVE, "IT MAY BE
THAT THE FIRST MOLECULES WON'T LET US GO, I SUPPOSE, IF WE WON'T DO THE
EXPECTED."

 

  "A FINE SITUATION," SAID DEZHNEV INDIGNANTLY, SLIPPING INTO HIS LOCAL
DIALECT OF RUSSIAN, AS HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO DO WHEN EXCITED, AND WHICH
MORRISON ALWAYS HAD A BIT OF DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING. "THE BEST WE CAN
EXPECT IS THAT AN ENZYME MOLECULE EITHER HOLDS US FOREVER ALL BY HIMSELF
OR HOLDS US FOREVER IN A RELAY RACE AS WE PASS FROM ONE ENZYME TO
ANOTHER INDEFINITELY. -- MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'TO BE SAVED FROM THE
JAWS OF A WOLF BY A HUNGRY BEAR IS NO GREAT CAUSE FOR GRATITUDE.'"

 

  "PLEASE NOTICE," SAID KALIININ, "THAT NO ENZYME MOLECULE HAS ATTACHED
ITSELF TO US."

 

  "WHY IS THAT?" ASKED MORRISON, WHO HAD, INDEED, NOTICED THAT.

 

  "BECAUSE OF A SLIGHT CHANGE IN ELECTRIC CHARGE PATTERN. WE HAD TO
MIMIC A GLUCOSE MOLECULE TO GET INTO THE CELL, BUT ONCE IN, WE DON'T
HAVE TO BE ONE ANYMORE. IN FACT, WE MUST MIMIC SOMETHING ELSE."

 

  BORANOVA LEANED FORWARD. "WON'T ANY MOLECULE WE MIMIC BE LIABLE TO
METABOLIC CHANGE, SOPHIA?"

 

  "ACTUALLY, NO, NATALYA," SAID KALIININ. "GLUCOSE -- OR ANY OTHER
SIMPLE SUGAR IN THE BODY -- BELONGS TO A CERTAIN MOLECULAR
CONFIGURATION, SO THAT WE CALL IT D-GLUCOSE. I'VE SIMPLY ALTERED THE
PATTERN TO ITS MIRROR IMAGE. WE HAVE BECOME L-GLUCOSE AND THERE ISN'T AN
ENZYME THAT WILL TOUCH US NOW, ANY MORE THAN ANY OF US ARE LIKELY TO PUT
A RIGHT SHOE ON A LEFT FOOT. -- NOW WE CAN MOVE ABOUT FREELY."

 

  THE VESICLE WHICH HAD FORMED ON THEIR INTRODUCTION TO THE CELLULAR
INTERIOR HAD BROKEN UP AND MORRISON GAVE UP AS HOPELESS ANY ATTEMPT TO
FOLLOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. FRAGMENTS AROUND HIM WERE ENVELOPED BY MUCH
LARGER ENZYME MOLECULES THAT SEEMED TO EMBRACE THEM AND THEN RELAX.
PRESUMABLY, AN ALTERED VICTIM OF THE ENZYMATIC SQUEEZE WAS SET FREE TO
BE EMBRACED AGAIN BY ANOTHER ENZYME.

 

  IT WAS ALL HAPPENING AT ONCE AND, MORRISON KNEW, THIS WAS ONLY THE
ANAEROBIC PORTION OF THE PROCESS (IN WHICH NO MOLECULAR OXYGEN WAS
USED.) IT WOULD END BY BREAKING UP THE GLUCOSE MOLECULE, WITH ITS SIX
CARBON ATOMS, INTO TWO THREE-CARBON FRAGMENTS.

 

  A LITTLE ENERGY WOULD BE PRODUCED IN THIS FASHION AND THE FRAGMENTS
WOULD BE SHUNTED TO THE MITOCHONDRIA FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE PROCESS
WITH THE USE OF OXYGEN; A PROCESS IN WHICH THE UNIVERSAL ENERGY-TRANSFER
MOLECULE, ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE (OR ATP, FOR SHORT) WOULD BE INVESTED
IN ORDER TO GET THINGS STARTED AND, IN THE END, BE PRODUCED ONCE MORE IN
QUANTITIES SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THE INVESTMENT.

 

  MORRISON FELT THE URGE TO DROP EVERYTHING AND TO FIND A WAY INTO A
MITOCHONDRION, THE SMALL ENERGY FACTORY OF THE CELL. AFTER ALL, THE FINE
DETAILS OF MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSES HAD STILL NOT BEEN WORKED OUT -- BUT
THEN HE PULLED AWAY ALMOST ANGRILY AT THE THOUGHT. THE SKEPTIC WAVES
CAME FIRST. HE SHOUTED THAT TO HIMSELF, AS THOUGH TRYING TO FORCE A
REALIZATION OF PRIORITIES ONTO AN OVERLY CURIOUS BRAIN THAT WAS
THREATENING TO DIFFUSE ITS INTERESTS.

 

  APPARENTLY, THE SAME THOUGHT OCCURRED TO KONEV, FOR HE SAID, "WE'RE
FINALLY INSIDE THE NEURON, ALBERT. LET'S NOT BE TOURISTS. WHAT DO YOU
FIND IN THE WAY OF SKEPTIC WAVES NOW?"

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 14 -- AXON

 

  THOSE WHO SAY "A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS" ARE USUALLY BEING
OVERGENEROUS.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  60.

 

  MORRISON BRISTLED AT KONEV'S ORDER. (IT HAD DEFINITELY BEEN THAT.)

 

  HE INDICATED HIS RESENTMENT BY REFUSING TO RESPOND AT ALL FOR A WHILE.
HE CONTINUED TO STARE OUT INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE NEURON AND COULD
DISTINGUISH NOTHING HE RECOGNIZED. HE COULD SEE FIBERS, CONVOLUTED
PLATES, HULKS OF UNCERTAIN SIZE AND OF NO CLEAR SHAPE. WHAT'S MORE, HE
HAD A STRONG FEELING THAT THERE WAS A SKELETAL PRESENCE IN THE CELL THAT
HELD THE LARGER OBJECTS -- THE ORGANELLES -- IN PLACE, BUT THAT THE SHIP
WAS SLIPPING PAST IT ALL TOO QUICKLY, AS THOUGH IT WERE IN A RIVER
RACING DOWNSTREAM. THE FEELING OF MOTION WAS FAR STRONGER HERE THAN IN
THE BLOODSTREAM, FOR THOUGH THERE WERE SMALL OBJECTS (DEBRIS?) THAT
MOVED ALONG WITH THEM, THERE WERE LARGER OBJECTS THAT APPARENTLY
REMAINED IN PLACE AND THAT THEY PASSED RAPIDLY.

 

  FINALLY MORRISON SAID, "LOOK, YURI, WE'RE MOVING SO QUICKLY THAT THE
MOTION IS LIKELY TO DISTORT THE SKEPTIC WAVES BADLY."

 

  KONEV SNARLED, "ARE YOU MAD? WE'RE NOT MOVING QUICKLY AT ALL. WE'RE
JUST DRIFTING WITH THE INTRACELLULAR STREAM THAT SERVES TO MAKE CERTAIN
THAT THE SMALL MOLECULES ARE ALL MADE AVAILABLE TO THE ORGANELLE
STRUCTURE OF THE CELL. THE MOVEMENT IS VERY SLOW ON THE NORMAL SCALE; IT
SEEMS FAST ONLY ON OUR MINIATURIZED SCALE. DO I HAVE TO TEACH YOU
CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY?"

 

  MORRISON BIT HIS LIPS. OF COURSE. HE HAD AGAIN FORGOTTEN HOW
MINIATURIZATION DISTORTED HIS PERCEPTION. AND AGAIN KONEV WAS COMPLETELY
RIGHT.

 

  "IT MIGHT BE BETTER, THOUGH," SAID MORRISON, FIGHTING FOR
SELF-RESPECT, "IF WE CHANGED BACK TO D-GLUCOSE AND ALLOWED AN ENZYME TO
SNATCH US UP. THE COMBINED SIZE WOULD SLOW US DOWN AND MAKE IT EASIER TO
PICK UP THE WAVES."

 

  "WE DON'T HAVE TO SLOW DOWN. THE NERVE IMPULSE TRAVELS AT A MINIMUM OF
TWO METERS PER SECOND IN REAL VELOCITY AND IN APPARENT VELOCITY AT OUR
SIZE THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTY TIMES THE REAL SPEED OF LIGHT. AS COMPARED
WITH THAT, OUR SPEED, HOWEVER GREAT IT SEEMS, IS TRIVIAL. EVEN IF WE ARE
MOVING AT THE APPARENT SPEED OF A ROCKET SHIP, TO THE NERVE IMPULSE WE
SEEM VIRTUALLY MOTIONLESS."

 

  MORRISON LIFTED HIS ARM IN SURRENDER AND FELT FURIOUS WITH KONEV.
THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO RIGHT. HE CAST A QUICK SIDEWISE
GLANCE AT KALIININ, WITH THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT SHE WOULD BE
SHOWING HER CONTEMPT. SHE MET HIS GLANCE SOBERLY AND WITH NO TRACE OF A
SNEER. IN FACT, HER SHOULDERS LIFTED SLIGHTLY AS THOUGH TO SAY (MORRISON
IMAGINED), "WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OF A SAVAGE?"

 

  BORANOVA (MORRISON GLANCED OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER) SEEMED OBLIVIOUS TO
THE EXCHANGE. SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER INSTRUMENT AND MORRISON WONDERED
WHAT SHE COULD BE SO INTENT ON, CONSIDERING THAT THE SHIP'S ENGINES WERE
OFF AND THEY WERE MERELY DRIFTING WITH THE CURRENT.

 

  AS FOR DEZHNEV -- WITH THE ENGINES OFF -- HE WAS THE ONE CREW MEMBER
WHO, IN TRUTH, HAD NOTHING TO DO AT THE MOMENT (EXCEPT TO KEEP HALF AN
EYE AT THE MATERIAL UP AHEAD IN CASE OF AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY).

 

  HE SAID, "COME, ALBERT, STUDY THE SKEPTIC WAVES AND GIVE US SOME
ANSWERS. THEN WE CAN LEAVE THIS PLACE. IT'S EXTREMELY EXCITING BEING
INSIDE A CELL FOR THOSE WHO LIKE IT, BUT ALREADY I AM QUITE CERTAIN I
HAVE SEEN ENOUGH. MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THE MOST EXCITING PART OF ANY
TRIP IS REACHING HOME AGAIN.'"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ARKADY --"

 

  "YES, NATASHA."

 

  "SAVE A FEW WORDS FOR TOMORROW." MORRISON NOTICED THE TRACE OF A SMILE
ON HER LIPS.

 

  "CERTAINLY, NATASHA. I SUSPECT AN ATTEMPT AT SARCASM, BUT I SHALL DO
AS YOU SAY." AND THOUGH HE SNAPPED HIS MOUTH SHUT WITH AN EXAGGERATED
CLICK OF HIS TEETH, HE BEGAN TO HUM VERY QUIETLY TO HIMSELF, A TUNE IN
THE MINOR MODE.

 

  MORRISON FELT A LITTLE ASTONISHED. THEY HAD BEEN IN THE SHIP NOW FOR A
LITTLE LESS THAN FIVE HOURS -- BUT IT FELT THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF
DAYS, PERHAPS YEARS. YET, UNLIKE ARKADY AND DESPITE HIS EARLIER FEELINGS
OF TERROR, HE WAS NOT READY TO LEAVE SHAPIROV'S BODY. HE FELT A STRONG
URGE TO EXPLORE THE CELL AND HIS THOUGHTS RESTED ON THE POSSIBILITY.

 

  KALIININ MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING ALONG SIMILAR LINES, FOR SHE SAID IN
A SOFT, INTROSPECTIVE TONE, "WHAT A SHAME TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE INSIDE
THE MOST COMPLEX OF ALL LIVING CELLS AND TO DO NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT
INVESTIGATING IT PROPERLY."

 

  "THAT IS EXACTLY --" BEGAN MORRISON, THEN THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND LET
THE WORDS DANGLE.

 

  KONEV SWUNG HIS ARM AS THOUGH HE WERE DRIVING OFF HORDES OF INSECTS.
"I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WE ARE IN THE CELL AND WE CAME HERE FOR A
SPECIFIC PURPOSE. ALBERT, FOCUS ON THE SKEPTIC WAVES."

 

  "I AM DOING SO," SAID MORRISON SHARPLY. "IN FACT, I HAVE DONE SO. --
LOOK!"

 

  KONEV TWISTED HIS HEAD, THEN UNCLASPED HIMSELF, SO THAT HE COULD TURN
AROUND AND PEER OVER THE BACK OF HIS SEAT. HE STARED AT MORRISON'S SMALL
SCREEN AND SAID, "THE WAVES SEEM SHARPER."

 

  "THEY ARE SHARPER. THEY'RE MORE INTENSE AND THEY SHOW FINER
OSCILLATIONS THAN I'VE EVER SEEN. COME TO THINK OF IT, I WONDER HOW FINE
THEY CAN GET. SOONER OR LATER, AN OSCILLATION, IF FINE ENOUGH, WILL
REPRESENT THE WOBBLING OF A SINGLE ELECTRON -- AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE."

 

  "YOU FORGET. WE'RE MINIATURIZED AND PLANCK'S CONSTANT IS NINE ORDERS
OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER FOR US THAN IT IS UNDER STANDARD CONDITIONS."

 

  "YOU FORGET," PROTESTED MORRISON, EAGER TO CATCH THE OTHER IN A
MISSTEP THIS TIME, "THAT THE WAVES ARE REDUCED BY THAT MUCH BEFORE THEY
REACH US. THOSE WAVES ARE EXACTLY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE RELATIVE TO THE
UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE, THEREFORE."

 

  KONEV HESITATED A BARE MOMENT. "IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE'RE LOOKING AT
SOMETHING NOW AND THERE'S NO PERCEPTIBLE UNCERTAINTY BLURRING. WHAT DOES
IT MEAN?"

 

  "IT SUPPORTS MY THEORY," SAID MORRISON. "THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I OUGHT
TO SEE INSIDE A CELL IF MY INTERPRETATION OF SKEPTIC WAVE ACTIVITY IS
CORRECT --"

 

  "THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. WE BEGAN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOUR THEORY
WAS CORRECT. NOW IT'S NO LONGER AN ASSUMPTION, IT'S A DEMONSTRATED FACT,
AND I CONGRATULATE YOU. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN? WHAT DO THOSE SKEPTIC
WAVES SHOW SHAPIROV TO BE THINKING?"

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I HAVE NO DATA -- ZERO DATA -- ON THE
CORRELATION OF SUCH WAVES AND SPECIFIC THOUGHTS. IT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO
GATHER SUCH A CORRELATION, IF IT COULD BE DONE AT ALL."

 

  "BUT PERHAPS THE SKEPTIC WAVES, WHEN THIS CLEAR AND INTENSE, PRODUCE
AN INDUCTIVE EFFECT ON YOUR BRAIN. ARE YOU GETTING ANY OF YOUR FAMOUS
IMAGES?"

 

  MORRISON THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD, "NONE!"

 

  FROM BEHIND HIM CAME A QUIET VOICE, "I'M GETTING SOMETHING, ALBERT."

 

  MORRISON TURNED. "YOU, NATALYA?"

 

  "YES, IT'S ODD -- BUT I AM."

 

  KONEV DEMANDED, "WHAT ARE YOU GETTING, NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA HESITATED, CONCENTRATING. "CURIOSITY. WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
AN IMAGE OF ANYTHING. JUST AN IMPRESSION. I FEEL CURIOSITY."

 

  "AND SO YOU MIGHT," SAID MORRISON. "IT NEEDS NO IMPRESSION FROM
OUTSIDE TO PRODUCE SUCH A FEELING UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES."

 

  "NO NO. I KNOW WHAT MY OWN THOUGHTS AND IMPRESSIONS ARE LIKE. THIS IS
IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "DO YOU FEEL IT RIGHT NOW?"

 

  "YES. IT COMES AND GOES A LITTLE, BUT I FEEL IT RIGHT NOW."

 

  "ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT NOW?"

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED SURPRISED. "IT STOPPED SUDDENLY. -- DID YOU TURN OFF
YOUR MACHINE?"

 

  "I TURNED IT DOWN. NOW, YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU FEEL THE SENSATION AND
WHEN YOU DON'T." HE TURNED TO LOOK AT KALIININ, INTENDING TO TELL HER TO
SAY OR DO NOTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE WHEN HE TURNED THE MACHINE DOWN OR
UP, BUT SHE WAS STARING OUT AT THE CELL, OBVIOUSLY LOST IN THE MARVEL OF
WATCHING THE INTERIOR OF A NEURON. HE WONDERED IF, AT THE MOMENT, SHE
HEARD -- OR CARED -- WHAT WAS GOING ON.

 

  HE TURNED AWAY AND SAID, "NATALYA, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND CONCENTRATE.
JUST SAY 'ON' WHEN YOU GET THE SENSATION AND 'OFF` WHEN YOU DON'T."

 

  FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, SHE COMPLIED WITH HIS SUGGESTION.

 

  MORRISON SAID TO KONEV, "DOES THE MACHINE MAKE A NOISE WHEN IT IS
TURNED DOWN OR UP? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN HEAR OR SENSE?"

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING."

 

  "THEN THERE'S NO MISTAKE. SHE'S GETTING THE SENSATION ONLY WHEN THE
MACHINE IS ON."

 

  DEZHNEV, WHO, UNLIKE KALIININ, HAD FOLLOWED EVERYTHING, SAID. "BUT
WHY?" HIS EYES NARROWED. "THE BRAIN WAVES ARE THERE WHETHER YOUR MACHINE
DETECTS THEM OR NOT. SHE SHOULD GET THE FEELING OF CURIOSITY ALL THE
TIME."

 

  "NO NO," SAID MORRISON. "MY DEVICE FILTERS OUT ALL THE COMPONENTS BUT
THE ACTUAL SKEPTIC WAVES. WITHOUT THE MACHINE, SHE JUST GETS A CONFUSED
MASS OF SENSATIONS, RESPONSES, CORRELATIONS, AND MISCELLANY OF ALL
KINDS. WITH THE MACHINE, SHE GETS ONLY THE SKEPTIC WAVES, WHICH FURTHER
DEMONSTRATES THE USEFULNESS OF MY THEORY."

 

  "I DON'T GET ANYTHING AT ALL," SAID DEZHNEV, FROWNING. "DOESN'T THAT
DESTROY YOUR THEORY?"

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "BRAINS ARE COMPLICATED MECHANISMS. NATALYA GETS
IT. YOU DON'T. FOR THAT MATTER, NEITHER DO I. MAYBE THIS PARTICULAR
SKEPTIC WAVE COMPONENT FITS SOMETHING IN NATALYA'S BRAIN, NOT IN OURS.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING AT ONCE. -- DO YOU GET
ANYTHING, KONEV?~

 

  "NO," HE ANSWERED, AS DISCONTENTED AS DEZHNEV HAD BEEN. "YET I
OBTAINED IMPRESSIONS WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE THE NEURON."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID NOTHING.

 

  KONEV BURST OUT, "CAN'T YOU GET ANYTHING BUT JUST A VAGUE FEELING OF
CURIOSITY, NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA, "NO, YURI, I CAN'T. NOT AT THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU REMEMBER
PYOTR SHAPIROV. HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING."

 

  "I REMEMBER, BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP. ALBERT, IN WHAT DIRECTION ARE WE
MOVING?"

 

  ALBERT SAID, "DOWNSTREAM. IT'S THE ONLY DIRECTION IN WHICH WE CAN
MOVE."

 

  "NO NO." THEN, IN SUDDEN ANGER, "IS THAT A JOKE? ARE YOU TRYING TO BE
FUNNY?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "NOT AT ALL. YOU ASKED IN WHAT DIRECTION WE WERE GOING.
WHAT OTHER ANSWER COULD I HAVE GIVEN YOU? SURELY THE COMPASS DIRECTIONS
HAVE NO MEANING HERE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "ALL RIGHT. SORRY. THE STREAM GOES THIS WAY HERE. ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CELL, IT GOES THE OTHER WAY. IT'S A CIRCULATION. BUT
THE NERVE IMPULSE GOES ONE WAY ONLY, FROM THE DENDRITES TO THE AXON. ARE
WE ON THE SIDE OF THE CELL THAT'S TAKING US IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE
NERVE IMPULSE OR IN THE OTHER DIRECTION?"

 

  "DOES IT MATTER?" SAID MORRISON.

 

  "I THINK IT DOES. CAN YOUR DEVICE TELL YOU IN WHICH DIRECTION THE
IMPULSE IS TRAVELING?"

 

  "YES, CERTAINLY. THERE SHOULD BE A SLIGHT SHIFT IN THE SHAPE OF THE
WAVES, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ARE MEETING THE DEVICE HEAD-ON OR FROM
THE REAR."

 

  "AND?"

 

  "AND WE'RE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE IMPULSE."

 

  "GOOD! A STROKE OF LUCK. WE'RE HEADING FOR THE AXON, THEN."

 

  "SO IT WOULD SEEM."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "AND IF WE ARE HEADING FOR THE AXON?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "NATALYA, THINK! THE SKEPTIC WAVES TRAVEL ALONG THE
SURFACE OF THE CELL. THE CELL HERE IS WIDE AND RELATIVELY LARGE. THE
SKEPTIC WAVES SPREAD OUT OVER A LARGE SURFACE AND ARE WEAKENED IN
INTENSITY. AS THE CELL APPROACHES THE AXON, IT NARROWS. THE AXON ITSELF
IS LONG, A VERY LONG TUBE COMPARED TO THE CELL -- AND VERY NARROW. THE
WAVES MUST CONCENTRATE ENORMOUSLY AS THEY RACE ALONG THAT TUBE AND THEY
MUST GROW MORE INTENSE. WHAT'S MORE, THE AXON IS INSULATED BY A THICK
MYELIN SHEATH, SO THAT THE WAVE ENERGY WILL NOT BE LOST TO THE OUTSIDE,
BUT WILL BE KEPT TIGHTLY WITHIN THE AXON."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU THINK, THEN, THAT WE CAN RECEIVE MORE EFFECTIVELY
IN THE AXON?"

 

  "MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY. IF YOU CAN DETECT CURIOSITY NOW, IT SHOULD BE
OVERWHELMING IN THE AXON. AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DETECT WHAT SHAPIROV
IS CURIOUS ABOUT."

 

  "IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT," SAID MORRISON
THOUGHTFULLY. "WHAT IF HE'S CURIOUS ABOUT WHY HE SHOULD BE LYING THERE
AND NOT MOVING?"

 

  "NO," SAID KONEV SHARPLY, "THAT WOULD NOT INTEREST HIM. I KNEW
SHAPIROV WELL. YOU DIDN'T."

 

  MORRISON NODDED. "THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH."

 

  "ALL HIS WAKING TIME WAS CONSUMED WITH THE MINIATURIZATION PROCESS,"
SAID KONEV. "ALL HIS DREAMS, TOO, I SUSPECT. AND TOWARD THE END, IN THE
LAST FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE -- THE ACCIDENT TOOK PLACE, HE WAS WORKING,
THINKING, DREAMING OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN QUANTUM AND RELATIVITY,
THINKING OF HOW TO MAKE MINIATURIZATION AND DEMINIATURIZATION
ENERGY-FREE AND STABLE."

 

  "SURELY," SAID MORRISON, "IF THAT WERE THE CASE, HE MUST HAVE GIVEN
SOME HINTS AS TO SOME OF THE DETAILS OF HIS THINKING."

 

  "NO, HE WAS A CHILD IN SOME WAYS. WE KNEW WHAT HE WAS THINKING OF, BUT
NOT WHETHER HE WAS MAKING PROGRESS OR IN WHAT DIRECTION. WHAT HE LOVED
TO DO WAS TO PRESENT IT TO US WHOLE, COMPLETE. -- REMEMBER, NATALYA, HOW
HE LOVED TO DO THAT? HE DID THAT WITH MINIATURIZATION ITSELF. WHEN HE
FINALLY WROTE HIS PAPER -- IT WAS A YOUNG BOOK --"

 

  MORRISON SAID CASUALLY, "WHERE WAS IT PUBLISHED?"

 

  KONEV SNEERED. "YOU KNOW IT WASN'T PUBLISHED. IT HAD A LIMITED
CIRCULATION TO THOSE WHO HAD TO KNOW. IT'S NOWHERE WHERE YOU'RE LIKELY
EVER TO SEE IT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YURI, DON'T BE NEEDLESSLY INSULTING. ALBERT IS A
FELLOW CREW MEMBER AND A GUEST. HE IS NOT TO BE TREATED AS A SPY."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IF YOU SAY SO, NATALYA. NEVERTHELESS, IF SHAPIROV IS
CURIOUS, SO INTENSELY CURIOUS THAT NATALYA GETS THAT MESSAGE, IT CAN BE
ONLY ABOUT THE QUANTUM-RELATIVITY CONNECTION. IF WE CAN GET SOME DETAILS
ABOUT THAT, ANY DETAILS AT ALL, WE'LL HAVE A STARTING POINT AND CAN
CONTINUE."

 

  "AND YOU THINK WE'LL GET THOSE DETAILS IN THE AXON?"

 

  "YES, I'M SURE OF IT." KONEV CLENCHED BOTH FISTS AS THOUGH PREPARING
TO GET A STRANGLEHOLD ON THE FACTS.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AWAY. HE WAS NOT SURE OF IT. INCREASINGLY, IT WAS
BEGINNING TO LOOK TO HIM AS THOUGH MATTERS WERE MOVING IN ANOTHER
DIRECTION ALTOGETHER AND THAT THAT WAS JUST AS WELL--

 

  HE TRIED NOT TO SHOW IT, BUT HE WAS AS EXCITED AS KONEV WAS.

 

  61.

 

  DIM OBJECTS TO EITHER SIDE LOOMED UP AHEAD, DRIFTED TO ONE SIDE, LEFT
OR RIGHT, AND FELL BEHIND. RIBOSOMES? GOLGI APPARATUS? FIBRILS OF ONE
SORT OR ANOTHER? MORRISON COULD NOT TELL. FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF
SMALL MOLECULE SIZE, NOTHING, NOT EVEN THE SHARPEST, MOST FAMILIAR
INTRACELLULAR OBJECT, WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR, LET ALONE RECOGNIZABLE.

 

  THEY WERE RACING THROUGH A STRANGE LAND OF INDEFINITENESS AND MORRISON
COULD NOT, NO MATTER HOW HE TRIED, PICTURE HIS SURROUNDINGS AS THOSE
WITH WHICH HE WAS FAMILIAR FROM ELECTRON MICROGRAPHY.

 

  HE WONDERED IF, SOMEWHERE BEYOND WHERE THE LIGHT OF THE SHIP'S BEAM
EXTENDED, THERE WOULD BE THE ENDLESS VOLUME OF THE CELL'S NUCLEUS.
IMAGINE BEING WITHIN SUBMICROSCOPIC DISTANCE OF IT AND YET NEVER SEEING
IT.

 

  HE CONCENTRATED ON THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS. IT SEEMED TO HIM, ONCE
AGAIN, THAT HE OUGHT TO MAKE OUT THE WATER MOLECULES THAT MADE UP 98
PERCENT OF ALL THE MOLECULES IN THE CELL, THAT HUGE PERCENTAGE BEING THE
DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE JUST ABOUT THE SMALLEST
MOLECULES THERE.

 

  HE COULD NOT BE SURE. FOCUS HIS EYES THOUGH HE DID AND AS TIGHTLY AS
HE COULD, WHAT HE SAW WAS ONLY A FAINT GLITTER -- A PHOTON, PERHAPS,
BOUNCING OFF SUCH A MOLECULE AND FLASHING BACK TOWARD HIS EYE. AT BEST,
HE WOULD ONLY SEE ONE OR TWO FROM ANY GIVEN WATER MOLECULE.

 

  HE WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF KALIININ'S HEAD, BENDING TOWARD HIS. HER HAIR
BRUSHED HIS FACE AND HE NOTICED, AS HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE, THE
FRESH SCENT OF HER SHAMPOO.

 

  SHE SAID, "THIS IS TERRIBLE, ALBERT."

 

  HER BREATH WAS A LITTLE STRONG AND MORRISON FLINCHED BEFORE HE COULD
STOP HIMSELF.

 

  SHE NOTICED, FOR HER FINGERS CAME UP SHARPLY, COVERING HER MOUTH, AND
SHE MUMBLED, "I'M SORRY."

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY, "MY OWN BREATH ISN'T EXACTLY A BED
OF ROSES. -- TENSION, NOTHING MUCH TO EAT. A DRINK OF WATER MIGHT HELP,
NATALYA."

 

  ONE DRINK SET OFF EVERYBODY, OF COURSE, IN A CHAIN REACTION.

 

  KALIININ FINGERED A SMALL WHITE PELLET. "PEPPERMINT DROP?"

 

  MORRISON HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SMILED. "IS IT PERMITTED?"

 

  KALIININ'S EYE FLICKERED BACK TOWARD BORANOVA AND SHE GAVE A WHO-CARES
SHRUG. HAVING PASSED THE DROP TO MORRISON, SOPHIA POPPED ANOTHER IN HER
MOUTH.

 

  THEN SHE SAID AGAIN, "THIS IS TERRIBLE, ALBERT."

 

  "WHAT IS, SOPHIA?"

 

  "HOW CAN WE PASS THROUGH THIS CELL WITHOUT EXAMINING IT IN DETAIL?"

 

  "WE HAVE A SPECIFIC MISSION."

 

  "YES, BUT NO ONE MAY BE BACK WITHIN A BRAIN CELL FOR MANY YEARS.
PERHAPS, NEVER. WHEN, IN THE FUTURE, SOMEONE WILL READ THAT THIS SHIP
AND THIS CREW MERELY RACED THROUGH, LOOKING NEITHER TO RIGHT OR LEFT,
WHAT BARBARIANS THEY WILL THINK WE MUST HAVE BEEN."

 

  SHE WAS WHISPERING VERY SOFTLY AND THEIR HEADS WERE BENT CLOSE
TOGETHER. MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF RATHER ENJOYING IT.

 

  HAD HE GROWN SO CALLOUSED TO THE THREAT OF THE SITUATION -- THE
CONSTANT SKIRTING ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS OF SPONTANEOUS
DEMINIATURIZATION, THE POSSIBILITY OF SPLIT-SECOND DEATH AT ANY MOMENT
-- THAT HE COULD TAKE JOY FROM THE TRIVIAL FACT THAT HIS LIPS WERE SO
CLOSE TO THE PRETTY FACE OF A WOMAN?

 

  WELL, WHY QUARREL WITH THAT? LET THE NEARNESS ANESTHETIZE HIM, SO THAT
HE MIGHT FOR A MOMENT FORGET.

 

  MORRISON REMEMBERED THE SHARP IMAGE HE HAD HAD SO BRIEF A TIME BEFORE
OF A HAPPY, SMILING, BEAUTIFUL GIRL. HE HAD NOT RECOGNIZED THE THOUGHT
AS HIS OWN, SO UNEXPECTEDLY HAD IT COME OUT OF NOWHERE, AND IT DIDN'T
RETURN, EVEN NOW, BUT HE REMEMBERED IT DISTINCTLY AND THE MEMORY
SQUEEZED AT HIS HEART WITH A WARM FEELING.

 

  HE HAD THE MOMENTARY IMPULSE TO KISS HER LIGHTLY, JUST A TOUCH UPON
THE CHEEKBONE WITH HIS LIPS -- AND FOUGHT IT DOWN. IF SHE DECIDED TO
TAKE IT AMISS, HE WOULD FEEL LIKE AN INCREDIBLE FOOL.

 

  MORRISON SAID GENTLY, "THE PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE WILL KNOW WE HAVE A
MISSION. THEY WILL UNDERSTAND."

 

  "I WONDER," SOPHIA SAID, THEN PAUSED AND SENT A QUICK AND ALMOST
FEARFUL LOOK IN THE DIRECTION OF KONEV, WHO AS ALWAYS SAT STIFF AND
DETACHED AT ALLY SIGN OF SPEECH OR EVEN MOTION FROM KALIININ.

 

  SHE TURNED TO HER COMPUTER, SWITCHED IT TO THE WORD-PROCESSOR MODE,
AND TAPPED OUT IN RAPID RUSSIAN: YURI IS A FANATIC WHO SACRIFICES
EVERYTHING TO HIS MANIA. THERE IS NO CHANCE OF READING THOUGHTS, BUT HE
PERSUADES EVERYONE. SHE BLANKED IT, THEN TAPPED OUT: WE ARE HIS VICTIMS
AND BLANKED IT AT ONCE.

 

  FOR "WE," READ "I," THOUGHT MORRISON SADLY. HE LOOKED AT HIS OWN
INSTRUMENT HESITANTLY. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE THOUGHT WAVES, WHICH HE
HAD DIMMED TO LOW, WERE GROWING MORE INTENSE. MORRISON LOOKED OUT AS
THOUGH HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL JUST HOW NEAR THE AXON THEY NOW WERE,
BUT, OF COURSE, THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING.

 

  HE BLANKED THE RADIATION, SWITCHED TO WORD-PROCESSING, AND PRINTED OUT
IN ROMAN-LETTERED RUSSIAN: HE, TOO, IS HIS VICTIM.

 

  KALIININ AT ONCE PRINTED SAVAGELY: NO. I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE
THEIR OWN VICTIMS.

 

  MORRISON THOUGHT SADLY OF HIS ONE-TIME WIFE, HIS TWO CHILDREN, HIS OWN
INABILITY TO PRESENT HIS THEORY PERSUASIVELY, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, TO WALK
AWAY FROM IT, AND TAPPED OUT: I BELIEVE WE ARE EACH OF US MORE A VICTIM
OF OURSELVES THAN OF ANYONE ELSE AND RETURNED IT QUICKLY TO THE
THOUGHTWAVE MODE.

 

  HE SUCKED IN HIS BREATH SHARPLY. THE WAVES ON HIS SCREEN HAD RISEN
HIGH IN INTENSITY DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DEVICE WAS STILL AT LOW.

 

  MORRISON OPENED HIS MOUTH TO COMMENT ON THE FACT, BUT DEZHNEV MADE
THAT UNNECESSARY. "YURI," HE SAID, "THE CELL MEMBRANE IS CURVING IN AND
WE'RE CURVING IN WITH IT."

 

  THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT, THOUGHT MORRISON. THE CELL WAS NARROWING IN
TOWARD THE AXON AND THE SKEPTIC WAVES WERE BEING ENORMOUSLY
CONCENTRATED. HIS DEVICE, HAVING FILTERED OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, WOULD
RADIATE THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE SKEPTIC WAVES THROUGHOUT THE INTERIOR
OF THE SHIP. AND WITH WHAT RESULTS?

 

  KONEV SAID WITH DELIGHT, "WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOW. ALBERT, KEEP
YOUR MACHINE WORKING AT TOP INTENSITY."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "I HOPE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS GIVES US OUR ANSWER OR AT
LEAST A START TO OUR ANSWER. I HAVE GROWN TIRED WAITING."

 

  "I DON'T BLAME YOU," SAID DEZHNEV. "AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THE
LONGER IT TAKES TO GET TO A POINT, THE BLUNTER IT TURNS OUT TO BE.'"

 

  IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT EVERY LINE OF KONEV'S STIFF BODY NOW
BETOKENED EXCITEMENT AND EXPECTANT TRIUMPH -- BUT MORRISON DID NOT JOIN
IN THAT EXPECTATION.

 

  62.

 

  MORRISON STARED OUTWARD. THEY WERE WELL INTO THE AXON NOW AND BEING
CARRIED ALONG IT BY THE FLUID STREAM WITHIN THE CELL.

 

  IN THE REAL WORLD, THE AXON WAS AN EXCESSIVELY THIN FIBER, BUT IN THE
MICROMINIATURIZED WORLD OF THE SHIP, IT MIGHT BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A
HUNDRED KILOMETERS ACROSS. AS FOR ITS LENGTH, IT WAS MUCH, MUCH LONGER
THAN THE CELL ITSELF. GOING FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER OF THE AXON MIGHT
VERY WELL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A TRIP FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON AND
BACK A COUPLE OF DOZEN TIMES OVER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEIR APPARENT
SPEED ON THE MICROMINIATURIZED SCALE MUST SEEM, TO THEMSELVES, TO BE A
RESPECTABLE FACTION OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

 

  THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF THAT INCREDIBLY RAPID SPEED, HOWEVER. THE
SHIP WAS MOVING WITH THE CURRENT AND THERE WAS FAR LESS IN THE WAY OF
MACROMOLECULES OR ORGANELLES IN THE AXON THAN THERE HAD BEEN IN THE CELL
BODY. IF THERE WERE STRUCTURAL FIBERS WITHSTANDING THE CURRENT AND
REMAINING MOTIONLESS WITH RESPECT TO THE CELL MEMBRANE, THE CURRENT
SWEPT THEM PAST THOSE TOO RAPIDLY FOR THEM TO BE VISIBLE, EVEN IF A
SIZABLE NUMBER OF PHOTONS WERE REFLECTED FROM THEM -- WHICH, OF COURSE,
THEY WERE NOT.

 

  SO HE GAVE UP. THERE WAS NOTHING TO LOOK AT OUTSIDE.

 

  HE OUGHT, IN ANY CASE, TO BE LOOKING AT HIS SCREEN. THE SKEPTIC WAVES
WERE BECOMING EVEN MORE INTENSE, HE COULD SEE. IT HAD GROWN DIFFICULT TO
WIPE OUT THE NONSKEPTIC MATERIAL. IT WAS SO STRONG THAT IT FLOODED THE
COMPUTER'S RECEIVING CAPACITY.

 

  WHAT'S MORE, THE TIGHT, ELABORATE VIBRATION OF THE SKEPTIC WAVES HAD
BECOME A SERIES OF IRREGULAR SPIKES. EVEN AT FULL EXPANSION, IT WAS
CLEAR HE WASN'T GETTING ALL THE DETAIL THAT EXISTED. MORRISON HAD A
CLEAR VISION OF THE NECESSITY OF A LASER PRINTOUT CLEAR ENOUGH TO BE
PLACED UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

 

  KONEV HAD UNCLASPED HIMSELF AND HAD HALF-LIFTED HIMSELF OVER THE BACK
OF HIS SEAT SO THAT HE MIGHT STARE AT THE SCREEN.

 

  HE SAID, "I HAVEN'T SEEN IT LIKE THAT BEFORE."

 

  MORRISON REPLIED, "NOR HAVE I AND I HAVE BEEN STUDYING SKEPTIC WAVES
FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS. NOTHING LIKE THIS."

 

  "I WAS RIGHT, THEN, ABOUT THE AXON?"

 

  "ABSOLUTELY, YURI. THE WAVES HAVE CONCENTRATED THEMSELVES
BEAUTIFULLY."

 

  "AND THE MEANING, THEN?"

 

  MORRISON SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS HELPLESSLY. "THERE YOU HAVE ME. SINCE I
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T INTERPRET IT."

 

  "NO NO," SAID KONEV IMPATIENTLY. "YOU KEEP CONCENTRATING ON THE SCREEN
AND I KEEP THINKING ABOUT INDUCTION. OUR OWN MINDS ARE THE TRUE
RECEPTORS -- BY WAY OF YOUR MACHINE. WHAT DO YOU RECEIVE? IMAGES?
WORDS?"

 

  "NOTHING," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE."

 

  "ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING?"

 

  "IT'S YOUR MACHINE. ADJUSTED TO YOU."

 

  "YOU'VE HAD IMAGES BEFORE, YURI."

 

  DEZHNEV'S VOICE BROKE IN DRYLY, "MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'IF YOU WANT
TO HEAR, YOU MUST BEGIN BY LISTENING.'"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DEZHNEV SENIOR IS CORRECT. WE CAN RECEIVE NOTHING IF
WE FILL OUR MINDS WITH CONTENTION AND SHOUTS."

 

  KONEV DREW A DEEP BREATH AND SAID WITH A SOFTNESS THAT WAS MOST
UNCHARACTERISTIC OF HIM, "VERY WELL, THEN, LET US CONCENTRATE."

 

  AN UNNATURAL QUIET FELL OVER THE SHIP'S CREW.

 

  THEN KALIININ SAID, BREAKING THE SILENCE RATHER TIMIDLY, "THERE IS NO
TIME."

 

  "NO TIME FOR WHAT, SOPHIA," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "I MEAN THAT'S THE PHRASE I SENSED: 'THERE IS NO TIME.'"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU RECEIVED IT FROM SHAPIROV'S
SKEPTIC WAVES?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. IS THAT POSSIBLE?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "A MOMENT BEFORE I HAD THE SAME THOUGHT. IT OCCURRED TO
ME THAT A BETTER WAY OF TACKLING THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE TO STUDY THE
RECORDED SKEPTIC WAVES ON THE SCREEN AND TO WAIT FOR SUDDEN CHANGES. IT
MIGHT BE THE CHANGE OF PATTERN RATHER THAN THE PATTERN ITSELF THAT WOULD
PRODUCE AN IMAGE. BUT THEN I THOUGHT THAT THE WAITING MIGHT BE AN
ENORMOUSLY LONG DRAWN-OUT AFFAIR AND FOR THAT WE LACKED THE TIME."

 

  "IN OTHER WORDS," SAID MORRISON, "YOU THOUGHT, 'THERE IS NO TIME.'

 

  "YES," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT IT WAS MY OWN THOUGHT."

 

  "HOW CAN YOU KNOW, NATALYA?" SAID MORRISON.

 

  "I KNOW MY OWN THOUGHTS."

 

  "YOU ALSO KNOW YOUR OWN DREAMS, BUT SOMETIMES DREAMS ARISE OUT OF
EXTERNAL STIMULI. SUPPOSE YOU RECEIVE THE THOUGHT 'THERE IS NO TIME.'
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVING THOUGHTS, YOU QUICKLY BUILD
UP A LINE OF FREE ASSOCIATION THAT MAKES IT REASONABLE FOR YOU TO FEEL
THAT YOU HAVE HAD THE THOUGHT YOURSELF."

 

  "THAT MAY BE SO, BUT HOW DOES ONE TELL, ALBERT?"

 

  "I'M NOT SURE, BUT SOPHIA APPARENTLY SENSED THE SAME PHRASE AND WE
MIGHT ASK IF SHE WERE THINKING SOMETHING INDEPENDENTLY THAT WOULD GIVE
RISE TO THE PHRASE AS A MATTER OF COURSE."

 

  "NO, I WAS NOT," SAID KALIININ. "I WAS TRYING TO KEEP MY MIND EMPTY.
IT JUST CAME IN."

 

  "I DIDN'T SENSE ANYTHING," SAID MORRISON. "HOW ABOUT YOU, YURI?"

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD, FROWNING FEROCIOUSLY AT HIS FAILURE. "NO, I
DIDN'T."

 

  "IN ANY CASE," SAID MORRISON THOUGHTFULLY, "IT NEEDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
NATALYA FELT IT MIGHT BE AN IDLE THOUGHT THAT AROSE OUT OF A SERIES OF
PREVIOUS THOUGHTS IN A NATURAL WAY AND WITH NONE BUT THE MOST
SUPERFICIAL MEANING. EVEN IF THE THOUGHT HAD ARISEN IN SHAPIROV'S MIND,
IT MIGHT BE EQUALLY SUPERFICIAL THERE."

 

  "PERHAPS," SAID KONEV, "BUT PERHAPS NOT. HIS WHOLE LIFE AND MIND WERE
BOUND UP IN THE PROBLEMS OF MINIATURIZATION. HE WOULD BE THINKING OF
NOTHING ELSE."

 

  "YOU KEEP SAYING THAT," SAID MORRISON, "BUT, ACTUALLY, THAT IS
ROMANTIC NONSENSE. NO ONE THINKS OF NOTHING ELSE. THE MOST LOVESICK
ROMEO IN HISTORY COULD NOT CONCENTRATE ON HIS JULIET FOREVER. A TWINGE
OF COLIC, A DISTANT SOUND, AND HE WOULD BE DISTRACTED AT ONCE."

 

  "NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST TAKE ANYTHING SHAPIROV SAYS AS POSSIBLY
SIGNIFICANT."

 

  "POSSIBLY," SAID MORRISON. "BUT WHAT IF HE WERE TRYING TO WORK OUT THE
EXTENSION OF THE MINIATURIZATION THEORY AND DECIDED TO MOAN HE HAD NO
TIME, THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE HIS WORK?"

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD, MORE, IT SEEMED, TO BRUSH OFF DISTRACTION THAN
IN A CLEAR NEGATIVE. HE SAID, "HOW ABOUT THIS? WHAT IF IT SEEMED TO
SHAPIROV THAT ANY MINIATURIZATION THAT INVOLVED AN INCREASE IN THE SPEED
OF LIGHT PROPORTIONAL TO THE DECREASE IN PLANCK'S CONSTANT WOULD INVOLVE
A CHANGE THAT WAS INSTANTANEOUS, THAT TOOK NO TIME. AND, OF COURSE, AS
THE SPEED OF LIGHT INCREASED VASTLY, SO WOULD THE INEVITABLE SPEED OF A
MASSLESS -- OR NEARLY MASSLESS -- OBJECT. HE WOULD, IN EFFECT, ABOLISH
TIME AND COULD SAY TO HIMSELF PROUDLY, 'THERE IS NO TIME.'"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "VERY FARFETCHED."

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID KONEV, "BUT WORTH THINKING ABOUT. WE MUST RECORD
EVERY IMPRESSION WE GET, HOWEVER DIM, HOWEVER APPARENTLY MEANINGLESS."

 

  "I PLAN TO DO PRECISELY THAT, YURI," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  KONEV SAID, "THEN QUIET AGAIN. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET ANYTHING MORE."

 

  MORRISON CONCENTRATED FIERCELY, HIS EYES HALF-BURIED UNDER JUTTING
EYEBROWS, BUT THOSE SAME EYES WERE FIXED ON KONEV, WHO SIGHED AND SAID
IN A WHISPER, "I GET SOMETHING OVER AND OVER -- 'NU TIMES C EQUALS M SUB
S.'"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I GOT THAT, TOO, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 'M TIMES C
SQUARE.'

 

  "NO," SAID KONEV TIGHTLY. "TRY AGAIN."

 

  MORRISON CONCENTRATED, THEN, QUITE ABASHED, SAID, "YOU'RE RIGHT. I GET
IT, TOO: 'NU TIMES C EQUALS M SUB S.' WHAT DOES IT MEAN?"

 

  "WHO CAN SAY AT FIRST GLANCE? HOWEVER, IF THIS IS IN SHAPIROV'S MIND,
IT MEANS SOMETHING. WE CAN ASSUME THAT NU IS RADIATIONAL FREQUENCY, C
THE SPEED OF LIGHT, AND M SUB S IS THE STANDARD MASS -- THAT IS, THE
MASS AT REST UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS. IN THE LIGHT OF --"

 

  BORANOVA'S ARMS LIFTED WITH AN ADMONITORY FOREFINGER UPRAISED. KONEV
STOPPED SHORT AND SAID UNCOMFORTABLY, "BUT THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR
THERE."

 

  MORRISON GRINNED, "CLASSIFIED MATERIAL, EH, YURI?"

 

  AND THEN DEZHNEV'S VOICE SOUNDED WITH AN UNACCUSTORNED PETULANCE TO
IT. "HOW IS IT," HE SAID, "THAT YOU ARE HEARING ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT
TIME AND STANDARD MASS AND WHATNOT AND I SENSE NOTHING? IS IT THAT I AM
NOT A SCIENTIST?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I DOUBT THAT THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. BRAINS
ARE DIFFERENT. MAYBE THEY COME IN DIFFERENT TYPES THE WAY BLOOD DOES.
BLOOD IS BLOOD BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TRANSFUSE ONE PERSON'S BLOOD INTO
ANOTHER. YOUR BRAIN MAY BE SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENT FROM SHAPIROV'S SO
THAT THERE IS NO SENSORY CROSSOVER."

 

  "ONLY MINE?"

 

  "NOT ONLY YOURS. THERE MAY BE BILLIONS OF MINDS THAT CAN PICK UP
NOTHING FROM SHAPIROV. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT SOPHIA AND NATALYA CAN PICK UP
THE SAME THINGS, WHICH YURI AND I CANNOT -- AND VICE VERSA."

 

  "TWO MEN AND TWO WOMEN," GRUMPED DEZHNEV, "AND I AM WHAT?"

 

  KONEV SAID IMPATIENTLY, "YOU ARE WASTING OUR TIME, ARKADY. LET'S NOT
ENDLESSLY DISCUSS EVERY TINY THING WE PICK UP. WE HAVE MORE TO HEAR AND
LITTLE TIME TO DO IT IN. IF YOU CONCENTRATE A LITTLE HARDER, ARKADY,
YOU, TOO, MAY SENSE SOMETHING."

 

  SILENCE!

 

  IT WAS BROKEN OCCASIONALLY BY A SOFT MURRNUR FROM ONE OR ANOTHER WHO
REPORTED SENSING AN IMAGE OR A SCRAP OF WORDS. DEZHNEV CONTRIBUTED ONLY
ONE THING: "I SENSE A FEELING OF HUNGER, BUT IT MAY BE MY OWN."

 

  "UNDOUBTEDLY," SAID BORANOVA DRYLY. "CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE
THOUGHT, ARKADY, THAT WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE, YOU WILL BE ALLOWED
SECONDS AND THIRDS OF EVERY DISH AND UNLIMITED VODKA."

 

  DEZHNEV GRINNED ALMOST LASCIVIOUSLY AT THE THOUGHT.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WE DON'T SEEM TO COME ACROSS ANYTHING MATHEMATICAL OR
EVEN OUT OF THE ORDINARY. I INSIST THAT EVEN SHAPIROV MUST HAVE THE
GREAT MAJORITY OF HIS THOUGHTS CONCERNED WITH TRIVIA."

 

  "NEVERTHELESS," GRUNTED KONEV UNDER HIS BREATH, "WE LISTEN."

 

  "FOR HOW LONG, YURI?"

 

  "TILL THE END OF THE AXON. RIGHT DOWN TO THE END."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "DO YOU THEN INTEND TO RUN INTO THE SYNAPSES OR WILL
YOU DOUBLE BACK?"

 

  "WE WILL GO AS CLOSE TO THE SYNAPSES AS POSSIBLE. THAT WILL BRING US
INTO THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ADJOINING NERVE CELL AND THE
SKEPTIC WAVES MAY BE EVEN MORE EASILY SENSED AT THAT CRUCIAL POINT OF
TRANSFER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "YES, YURI, BUT YOU ARE NOT THE CAPTAIN. -- NATASHA,
LITTLE FLOWER, IS THAT WHAT YOU WISH, TOO?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHY NOT? YURI IS RIGHT. THE SYNAPSE IS A UNIQUE SPOT
AND WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT."

 

  "I ASK ONLY BECAUSE HALF OUR POWER SUPPLY HAS NOW BEEN CONSUMED. HOW
LONG DARE WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN WITHIN THE BODY?"

 

  "LONG ENOUGH," SAID BORANOVA, "TO REACH THE SYNAPSE, CERTAINLY."

 

  AND SILENCE FELL ONCE MORE.

 

  63.

 

  THE SHIP CONTINUED TO MOVE ALONG THE ENORMOUS LENGTH OF THE AXON AND
KONEV DICTATED THE ACTIONS OF THE OTHERS MORE AND MORE.

 

  "WHATEVER YOU GET, REPORT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE OR
NOT, WHETHER IT'S ONE WORD OR A PARAGRAPH. IF IT'S AN IMAGE, DESCRIBE
IT. EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S YOUR OWN THOUGHT, REPORT IT IF THERE'S THE
SLIGHTEST DOUBT."

 

  "YOU'LL HAVE MEANINGLESS CHATTER," SAID DEZHNEV, APPARENTLY STILL
ANNOYED AT HIS NONRECEIVING BRAIN.

 

  "OF COURSE, BUT TWO OR THREE MEANINGFUL HINTS WILL PAY ALL. AND WE
WON'T KNOW WHAT'S MEANINGFUL UNTIL WE EXAMINE EVERYTHING."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "IF I SENSE SOMETHING I THINK ISN'T MINE, DO I THROW IT
IN, TOO?"

 

  "YOU, ESPECIALLY," SAID KONEV. "IF YOU'RE AS INSENSITIVE AS YOU SEEM
TO THINK, ANYTHING YOU DO GET MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. NOW,
PLEASE, NO MORE TALK. EVERY SECOND OF CONVERSATION MAY MEAN WE MISS
SOMETHING."

 

  AND THERE BEGAN A PERIOD OF DISJOINTED PHRASES OUT OF WHICH, IN
MORRISON'S OPINION, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE SENSE.

 

  ONE SURPRISE CAME WHEN KALIININ SAID SUDDENLY, "'NOBEL PRIZE!'"

 

  KONEV LOOKED UP SHARPLY AND ALMOST RESPONDED -- THEN, AS THOUGH
REALIZING WHO HAD SAID IT, HE SUBSIDED.

 

  MORRISON SAID, TRYING NOT TO SOUND MOCKING, "DID YOU GET THAT, TOO,
YURI?"

 

  KONEV NODDED. "AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME."

 

  "THAT'S THE FIRST CROSSOVER BETWEEN A MAN AND WOMAN," SAID MORRISON.
"I SUPPOSE SHAPIROV HAD HIS MIND ON IT IN CONNECTION WITH HIS EXTENSION
OF MINIATURIZATION THEORY."

 

  "UNDOUBTEDLY. BUT HIS NOBEL PRIZE WAS SURE FOR WHAT HE HAD ALREADY
DONE IN MINIATURIZATION."

 

  "WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AND THEREFORE UNKNOWN."

 

  "YES. BUT ONCE WE PERFECT THE PROCESS, IT WILL NO LONGER BE UNKNOWN."

 

  "LET'S HOPE SO," SAID MORRISON SARDONICALLY.

 

  KONEV SNAPPED, "WE ARE NO MORE SECRETIVE THAN YOU AMERICANS."

 

  "ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT ARGUING," BUT MORRISON GRINNED BROADLY AT KONEV,
WHO WAS PEERING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HIM, AND THAT SEEMED TO IRRITATE
THE YOUNGER MAN EVEN FURTHER.

 

  AT ONE POINT, DEZHNEV SAID, "'HAWKING.'"

 

  MORRISON'S EYEBROWS LIFTED IN SURPRISE. HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THIS.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, LOOKING DISPLEASED, "WHAT IS THIS, ARKADY?"

 

  "I SAID, 'HAWKING,'" SAID DEZHNEV DEFENSIVELY. "OUT OF NOWHERE IT
POPPED INTO MY MIND. YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT DID."

 

  "IT IS AN ENGLISH WORD," SAID BORANOVA, "THAT MEANS 'SPITTING.'

 

  "OR 'SELLING,'" SAID MORRISON CHEERFULLY.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ENGLISH TO KNOW THAT WORD. I
THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEONE'S NAME."

 

  "SO IT WAS," SAID KONEV UNCOMFORTABLY. "STEPHEN HAWKING. HE WAS A
GREAT ENGLISH THEORETICAL PHYSICIST OF OVER A CENTURY AGO. I WAS
THINKING OF HIM, TOO, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS MY OWN THOUGHT."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "GOOD, ARKADY. THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL."

 

  DEZHNEV'S FACE SPLIT WITH A GRIN. "I'M NOT ALTOGETHER USELESS, THEN.
AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'IF THE WORDS OF A WISE MAN ARE FEW, THEY ARE
NEVERTHELESS WORTH LISTENING TO.'"

 

  AN INTERMINABLE HALF HOUR LATER, MORRISON SAID GENTLY, "ARE WE GETTING
ANYWHERE AT ALL? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MOST OF THE PHRASES AND IMAGES TELL
US NOTHING. 'NOBEL PRIZE' TELLS US, REASONABLY ENOUGH, THAT SHAPIROV
THOUGHT OF WINNING ONE, BUT WE KNOW THAT. 'HAWKING' TELLS US THAT THAT
PHYSICIST'S WORK WAS SIGNIFICANT, PERHAPS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE
EXTENSION OF MINIATURIZATION, BUT IT DOESN'T TELL US WHY."

 

  IT WAS NOT KONEV WHO ROSE TO THE DEFENSE, AS MORRISON WOULD HAVE
EXPECTED, BUT BORANOVA. KONEV, WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN READYING HIMSELF FOR
A RESPONSE, SEEMED WILLING, ON THIS OCCASION, TO LET THE CAPTAIN BEAR
THE WEIGHT.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ENORMOUS CRYPTOGRAM, ALBERT.
SHAPIROV IS A MAN IN A COMA AND HIS BRAIN IS NOT THINKING IN A
DISCIPLINED OR ORDERLY FASHION. IT IS SPARKING WILDLY, THOSE PARTS OF IT
THAT REMAIN WHOLE, PERHAPS RANDOMLY. WE COLLECT EVERYTHING WITHOUT
DISTINCTION AND IT WILL ALL BE STUDIED BY THOSE OF US WITH A DEEP
UNDERSTANDING OF MINIATURIZATION THEORY. THEY MAY SEE MEANING WHERE YOU
SEE NONE. AND A BIT OF MEANING, IN ONE CORNER OF THE FIELD, MAY BE THE
START OF AN ILLUMINATION THAT WILL SPREAD TO ALL PARTS OF IT. WHAT WE
ARE DOING MAKES SENSE AND IT IS THE PROPER THING TO DO."

 

  KONEV THEN SAID, "BESIDES, ALBERT, THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN TRY.
WE ARE APPROACHING A SYNAPSE. THIS AXON WILL END EVENTUALLY AND SPLIT UP
INTO MANY FIBERS, EACH OF WHICH WILL APPROACH BUT NOT JOIN WITH THE
DENDRITE OF A NEIGHBORING NEURON."

 

  "I KNOW THAT," SAID MORRISON IMPATIENTLY.

 

  "THE NERVE IMPULSE, INCLUDING THE SKEPTIC WAVES, WILL HAVE TO JUMP THE
TINY GAP OF THE SYNAPSE AND, IN DOING SO, THE DOMINANT THOUGHTS WILL BE
LESS ATTENUATED THAN THE OTHERS. IN SHORT, IF WE JUMP THE SYNAPSE, TOO,
WE WILL REACH A REGION WHERE WE MAY, FOR A WHILE AT LEAST, DETECT WHAT
WE WANT TO HEAR WITH LESS INTERFERENCE FROM TRIVIAL NOISE."

 

  "REALLY?" ASKED MORRISON ARCHLY. "THIS NOTION OF DIFFERENTIAL
ATTENUATION IS NEW TO ME."

 

  "IT'S THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING SOVIET WORK IN THE AREA."

 

  "AH!"

 

  KONEV FIRED UP AT ONCE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'AH!'? IS THAT A DISMISSAL
OF THE VALUE OF THE WORK?"

 

  "NO NO."

 

  "OF COURSE IT IS. IF IT'S SOVIET WORK, IT MEANS NOTHING."

 

  "I JUST MEAN THAT I HAVEN'T READ OR HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT," MORRISON
SAID IN DEFENSE."

 

  "THE WORK WAS DONE BY MADAME NASTIASPENSKAYA. I PRESUME YOU'VE HEARD
OF HER."

 

  "YES, I HAVE."

 

  "BUT YOU DON'T READ HER PAPERS, IS THAT IT?"

 

  "YURI, I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LITERATURE, LET ALONE
WITH --"

 

  "WELL, WHEN THIS IS OVER, I'LL SEE THAT YOU GET A COLLECTION OF HER
PAPERS AND YOU MAY EDUCATE YOURSELF."

 

  "THANK YOU, BUT MAY I SAY THAT ON THE FACE OF IT I THINK THE FINDING
IS AN UNLIKELY ONE. IF SOME TYPES OF MENTAL ACTIVITY SURVIVE A SYNAPSE
BETTER THAN OTHERS, THEN, CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF SYNAPSES IN THE BRAIN, ALL CONSTANTLY IN USE, THE FINAL
RESULT WOULD BE THAT ONLY A TINY PROPORTION OF THOUGHTS WOULD SURVIVE AT
ALL."

 

  "IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT," SAID KONEV. "THE TRIVIAL THOUGHTS ARE
NOT WIPED OUT. THEY CONTINUE AT A LOWER LEVEL OF INTENSITY AND DON'T
DECLINE INDEFINITELY. IT'S JUST THAT, IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A
SYNAPSE, THE IMPORTANT THOUGHTS ARE, FOR A TIME, RELATIVELY
STRENGTHENED."

 

  "IS THERE EVIDENCE FOR THIS? OR IS IT ONLY A SUGGESTION?"

 

  "THERE'S EVIDENCE OF A SUBTLE NATURE. EVENTUALLY, WITH MINIATURIZATION
EXPERIMENTS, THAT EVIDENCE WILL BE HARDENED, I'M SURE. THERE ARE SOME
PEOPLE AMONG WHOM THIS SYNAPSE EFFECT IS MUCH STRONGER THAN AVERAGE. WHY
ELSE CAN CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS CONCENTRATE SO HARD AND SO LONG, IF THEY
ARE NOT LESS DISTRACTED BY TRIVIA? AND WHY, ON THE CONTRARY, ARE
BRILLIANT SCHOLARS TRADITIONALLY ABSENTMINDED?"

 

  "VERY WELL. IF WE FIND SOMETHING, I WON'T QUARREL WITH THE RATIONALE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE COME TO THE END OF THE AXON?
THE STREAM OF FLUID WE'RE RIDING WILL JUST MAKE A U-TURN AT THAT POINT
AND CARRY US BACK AGAIN AGAINST THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE AXON. DO I
FORCE MY WAY THROUGH THE MEMBRANE?"

 

  "NO," SAID KONEV. "OF COURSE NOT. WE'D DAMAGE THE CELL. WE'LL HAVE TO
TAKE ON THE ELECTRIC CHARGE PATTERN OF ACETYLCHOLINE. THAT CARRIES THE
NERVE IMPULSE PATTERN ACROSS THE SYNAPSE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "SOPHIA, YOU CAN GIVE THE SHIP AN ACETYLCHOLINE
PATTERN, CAN'T YOU?"

 

  "I CAN," SAID KALIININ, "BUT AREN'T THE ACETYLCHOLINE MOLECULES ACTIVE
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CELL?"

 

  "NEVERTHELESS, THE CELL MAY HAVE A MECHANISM FOR EJECTING THEM. WE'LL
TRY."

 

  AND THE TRIP ALONG THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS AXON CONTINUED.

 

  64.

 

  SUDDENLY THE END OF THE AXON WAS IN SIGHT. THERE WAS NO HINT, NO
WARNING. KONEV NOTICED IT FIRST. HE WAS WATCHING AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS
WATCHING FOR, BUT MORRISON GAVE HIM FULL CREDIT. HE HIMSELF WAS
WATCHING, TOO, AND KNEW WHAT HE WAS WATCHING FOR, AND YET DID NOT SEE IT
WHEN IT CAME.

 

  TO BE SURE, KONEV WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT, WHILE MORRISON HAD TO STARE
PAST KONEV'S HEAD. THAT WAS NOT MUCH OF AN EXCUSE EITHER.

 

  IN THE CURIOUSLY INEFFECTIVE LIGHT OF THE SHIP'S BEACON, IT WAS CLEAR
THAT THERE WAS A HOLLOW AHEAD AND YET THE CURRENT WAS BEGINNING TO VEER
AWAY FROM IT.

 

  THE AXON WAS BEGINNING TO BREAK OFF INTO BRANCHES, INTO DENDRITES LIKE
THOSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE NEURON, AT THE END WHERE THE NUCLEATED
CELL BODY WAS. THE AXONIAN DENDRITES AT THE FAR END OF THE CELL WERE
FEWER AND THINNER, BUT THEY WERE THERE. UNDOUBTEDLY, A PORTION OF THE
CELLULAR STREAM FLOWED INTO IT, BUT THE SHIP WAS IN THE MAIN STREAM THAT
CURVED AWAY AND THEY COULD TAKE NO CHANCES.

 

  THEY WOULD HAVE TO PUSH INTO THE FIRST DENDRITE ENCOUNTERED -- IF IT
COULD BE DONE.

 

  "THERE, ARKADY, THERE," CRIED KONEV, POINTING, AND IT WAS ONLY THEN
THAT ALL THE REST REALIZED THEY WERE REACHING THE END OF THE AXON. "USE
YOUR MOTORS, ARKADY, AND PUSH OVER."

 

  MORRISON COULD MAKE OUT THE SOFT THROBBING OF THE MOTORS AS THEY EDGED
THE SHIP TOWARD THE SIDE OF THE STREAM. THE DENDRITE TOWARD WHICH THEY
AIMED WAS A TUBE THAT WAS SLIPPING SIDEWAYS, A HUGE TUBE AT THEIR SIZE
SCALE, SO HUGE THEY COULD ONLY SEE A SMALL ARC OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE.

 

  THEY CONTINUED TO EDGE CLOSER TO IT AND MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF LEANING
TOWARD THE DENDRITE, AS THOUGH ADDING BODY ENGLISH COULD IMPROVE
MATTERS.

 

  BUT IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF REACHING THE TUBE ITSELF, MERELY MOVING
OVER AN EDDYING SECTION OF FLUID, A RUSHING OF WATER MOLECULES THAT
QUIETED INTO GENTLE CIRCLES AND THEN SLIPPED BEYOND INTO ANOTHER STREAM
THAT WAS CURVING OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.

 

  THE SHIP MADE THE TRANSITION AND WAS SUDDENLY PLUNGING FORWARD INTO
THE TUBE OPENING.

 

  "TURN OFF THE MOTORS," SAID KONEV EXCITEDLY.

 

  "NOT YET," GRUMBLED DEZHNEV. "WE MAY BE TOO NEAR THE COUNTERCURRENT
EMERGING FROM THIS THING. LET ME SLIP OVER A BIT CLOSER TO THE WALL."

 

  HE DID SO, BUT THAT DID NOT TAKE LONG. THEY WERE NOW ESSENTIALLY
MOVING WITH THE CURRENT, NOT AGAINST IT. AND WHEN DEZHNEV DID FINALLY
SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND PUSHED BACK HIS DAMP, GRAYING HAIR, HE HEAVED A
GREAT BREATH AND SAID, "EVERYTHING WE DO CONSUMES A TON OF ENERGY.
THERE'S A LIMIT, YURI, THERE'S A LIMIT."

 

  "WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER," SAID KONEV IMPATIENTLY.

 

  "WILL WE?" SAID DEZHNEV. "MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID: 'LATER IS USUALLY TOO
LATE.' -- NATALYA, DON'T LEAVE ALL THIS TO YURI. I DON'T TRUST HIS
ATTITUDE TOWARD OUR ENERGY SUPPLY."

 

  "CALM YOURSELF, ARKADY. I WILL TAKE CARE TO OVERRIDE YURI IF IT
BECOMES NECESSARY. -- YURI, THE DENDRITE IS NOT VERY LONG, IS IT?"

 

  "WE WILL COME TO THE ENDING IN SHORT ORDER, NATALYA."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, SOPHIA, PLEASE SEE TO IT THAT WE ARE READY TO ADOPT THE
ACETYLCHOLINE PATTERN AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE."

 

  "YOU'LL GIVE ME THE SIGNAL, THEN?" SAID KALIININ.

 

  "I WILL NOT HAVE TO, SOPHIA. I'M SURE THAT YURI WILL WHOOP LIKE A
COSSACK WHEN THE END IS IN SIGHT. SHIFT THE PATTERN TO ACETYLCHOLINE AT
THAT MOMENT."

 

  THEY CONTINUED SLIDING ALONG THE FINAL TUBULAR REMNANT OF THE NEURON
THEY HAD ENTERED A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE. IT SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT,
AS THE DENDRITE CONTINUED TO NARROW, HE COULD SEE THE WALL ARC ABOVE
HIM, BUT THAT WAS ILLUSION. COMMON SENSE TOLD HIM THAT EVEN AT ITS
NARROWEST, THE TUBE WOULD APPEAR TO BE A FEW KILOMETERS ACROSS AT THEIR
PRESENT MOLECULAR SIZE.

 

  AND, AS BORANOVA HAD FORESEEN, KONEV LIFTED HIS VOICE IN A GREAT CRY,
PROBABLY QUITE UNAWARE THAT HE WAS DOING SO. "THE END IS AHEAD. QUICK.
ACETYLCHOLINE BEFORE WE'RE SWEPT AROUND AND BACK."

 

  KALIININ'S FINGERS FLICKERED OVER THE KEYBOARD. THERE WAS NO
INDICATION FROM INSIDE THE SHIP THAT ANYTHING ABOUT IT HAD CHANGED, BUT
SOMEWHERE UP AHEAD WAS AN ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR -- OR, MORE LIKELY,
HUNDREDS OF THEM -- AND THE PATTERNS MESHED, POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AND
NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE, SO THAT THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN SHIP AND RECEPTOR
WAS SHARP AND GREAT.

 

  THEY WERE PULLED OUT OF THE STREAM AND MELTED INTO AND THROUGH THE
WALL OF THE DENDRITE. FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY CONTINUED TO BE PULLED
THROUGH THE INTERCELLULAR MEDIUM BETWEEN THE DENDRITE OF THE NEURON THEY
HAD JUST LEFT AND THE DENDRITE OF THE NEIGHBOR NEURON.

 

  MORRISON SAW ALMOST NOTHING. THE SHIP, HE FELT, WAS SLIDING ALONG --
OR THROUGH -- A COMPLEX PROTEIN MOLECULE AND THEN HE NOTICED THE
FORMATION OF A CONCAVITY, AS WHEN THE SHIP HAD FIRST ENTERED THE FIRST
NEURON.

 

  KONEV HAD UNCLASPED HIMSELF SO THAT HE COULD STAND UP. (QUITE
OBVIOUSLY, HE WAS TOO EXCITED TO FEEL THIS WAS SOMETHING HE COULD DO
SITTING DOWN.)

 

  HE SAID, ALMOST STUTTERING, "NOW, ACCORDING TO THE NASTIASPENSKAYA
HYPOTHESIS, THE FILTERING OUT OF THE IMPORTANT THOUGHTS IS MOST EVIDENT
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYNAPSE. ONCE THE CELL BODY IS APPROACHED, THE
DIFFERENCE FADES. SO ONCE WE ARE IN THE NEIGHBORING DENDRITE, OPEN YOUR
MINDS. BE READY FOR ANYTHING. SAY WHATEVER YOU HEAR OUT LOUD. DESCRIBE
ANY IMAGES. I'LL RECORD EVERYTHING. YOU, TOO, ARKADY. ALBERT, YOU, TOO.
-- WE'RE IN NOW. BEGIN!"

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 15 -- ALONE!

 

  GOOD COMPANY ROBS EVEN DEATH OF SOME OF ITS TERRORS.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  65.

 

  MORRISON WATCHED WHAT FOLLOWED WITH A CERTAIN DETACHMENT. HE DID NOT
INTEND TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY. IF SOMETHING FORCED ITSELF INTO HIS
MIND, HE WOULD RESPOND AND REPORT IT. IT WOULD BE UNSCIENTIFIC NOT TO.

 

  KALIININ, AT HIS LEFT, LOOKED GRIM AND HER FINGERS WERE IDLE. HE
LEANED TOWARD HER AND WHISPERED, "HAVE YOU GOT US BACK AS L-GLUCOSE?"

 

  SHE NODDED.

 

  HE SAID, "ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS NASTIASPENSKAYA HYPOTHESIS?"

 

  SHE SAID, "IT'S NOT IN MY FIELD. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT."

 

  "DO YOU BELIEVE IT?"

 

  BUT KALIININ WAS NOT TO BE TRAPPED. SHE SAID, "I'M NOT QUALIFIED
EITHER TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE, BUT HE BELIEVES IT. -- BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO."

 

  "DO YOU SENSE ANYTHING?"

 

  "NOTHING MORE THAN BEFORE."

 

  DEZHNEV WAS, OF COURSE, SILENT. BORANOVA OCCASIONALLY PRODUCED A CRISP
WORD OR TWO, WHICH, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO MORRISON'S EARS TO LACK
CONVICTION.

 

  ONLY KONEV SEEMED TO MAINTAIN ENTHUSIASM. AT ONE POINT, HE CRIED OUT,
"DID ANYONE GET THAT? ANYONE? 'CIRCULAR RHYTHM.' 'CIRCULAR RHYTHM.'"

 

  THERE WAS NO DIRECT ANSWER AND, AFTER A WHILE, MORRISON SAID, "WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN, YURI?"

 

  KONEV DID NOT ANSWER. -- AND EVEN HE GREW QUIET AFTER A WHILE AND WAS
REDUCED TO STARING BLANKLY AHEAD AS THE SHIP MOVED ONWARD IN THE FLUID
STREAM.

 

  BORANOVA ASKED, "WELL, YURI?"

 

  KONEV SAID RATHER HOARSELY, "I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "YURI, LITTLE SON, IT MAY BE THIS IS A BAD NEURON AND
ISN'T DOING MUCH THINKING. WE'LL HAVE TO TRY ANOTHER AND MAYBE ANOTHER.
THE FIRST ONE MAY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY BEGINNER'S LUCK."

 

  KONEV LOOKED AT HIM ANGRILY. "WE DON'T WORK WITH SINGLE CELLS. WE'RE
IN A GROUP OF CELLS -- A MILLION OF THEM OR MORE -- THAT ARE A CENTER OF
CREATIVE THOUGHT BY ALBERT'S THEORY. WHAT ONE OF THEM THINKS, THEY ALL
THINK -- WITH MINOR VARIATIONS."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I HAVE SHOWN."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "THEN WE DON'T GO LOOKING FROM CELL TO CELL?"

 

  "IT WOULD BE NO USE," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "GOOD," SAID DEZHNEV HEAVILY, "BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND WE
DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY. SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"

 

  IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED, KONEV SAID AGAIN, "I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
IT. NASTIASPENSKAYA COULD NOT BE WRONG."

 

  AND NOW KALIININ, WITH GREAT DELIBERATION, UNCLASPED HERSELF AND STOOD
UP.

 

  SHE SAID, "I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING AND I DON'T WANT TO BE INTERRUPTED.
NATALYA, LISTEN TO ME. WE HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT
THAT PERHAPS HAD TO BE DONE, EVEN THOUGH, IN MY OPINION, IT WAS SURE TO
FAIL. WELL, IT HAS FAILED."

 

  SHE POINTED A SLIM FINGER BRIEFLY AT KONEV, WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM.
"SOME PEOPLE WANT TO ALTER THE UNIVERSE TO THEIR LIKING. WHATEVER IS NOT
SO, THEY WOULD MAKE SO BY SHEER FORCE OF WILL -- EXCEPT THAT THE
UNIVERSE IS BEYOND ANY PERSON'S WILL, SQUEEZE HE EVER SO HARD.

 

  "I DON'T KNOW IF NASTIASPENSKAYA IS CORRECT OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW IF
ALBERT'S THEORIES ARE CORRECT OR NOT. BUT THIS I KNOW-WHAT THEY THINK,
AND WHAT ANY NEUROSCIENTIST THINKS ABOUT THE BRAIN GENERALLY, MUST BE
ABOUT A REASONABLY NORMAL BRAIN. ACADEMICIAN SHAPIROV'S BRAIN IS NOT
REASONABLY NORMAL. TWENTY PERCENT OF IT IS NONFUNCTIONING-DEAD. THE REST
MUST BE DISTORTED IN CONSEQUENCE AND THE FACT THAT HE HAS BEEN IN A COMA
FOR WEEKS SHOWS THAT.

 

  "ANY REASONABLE HUMAN BEING WOULD REALIZE THAT SHAPIROV CANNOT BE
THINKING IN NORMAL FASHION. HIS BRAIN IS AN ARMY IN -- IN DISARRAY. IT
IS A FACTORY IN WHICH ALL THE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN JARRED LOOSE. IT IS
SPARKING RANDOMLY, EMITTING BROKEN THOUGHTS, SCATTERED PIECES, SPLINTERS
OF MEMORY. SOME MEN" -- SHE POINTED AGAIN -- "WON'T ADMIT IT BECAUSE
THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY ONLY INSIST LOUDLY ENOUGH AND STRONGLY ENOUGH,
THE OBVIOUS WILL RETREAT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE WILL SOMEHOW COME INTO
BEING."

 

  KONEV HAD NOW ALSO UNCLASPED AND WAS ALSO STANDING. HE TURNED SLOWLY
AND LOOKED AT KALIININ. (MORRISON WAS ASTONISHED. KONEV WAS ACTUALLY
LOOKING AT HER. AND ON HIS FACE THERE WAS NO VISIBLE SIGN OF ANGER OR
HATRED OR CONTEMPT. IT WAS A HANGDOG LOOK, WITH A TOUCH OF SELF-CONTEMPT
IN IT. MORRISON FELT SURE OF THIS.)

 

  YET KONEV'S VOICE WAS STEADY AND HARD AS HE LOOKED AWAY FROM KALIININ
AND TURNED TO BORANOVA, ADDRESSING HER.

 

  "NATALYA, WAS THIS POINT MADE BEFORE WE EMBARKED ON THIS VOYAGE?"

 

  "IF YOU MEAN, YURI, DID SOPHIA SAY ALL THIS TO ME BEFORE THIS MOMENT?
SHE DID NOT."

 

  "IS THERE ANY REASON WE SHOULD BE PLAGUED WITH CREW MEMBERS WHO HAVE
NO FAITH IN OUR WORK? WHY SHOULD SUCH A PERSON HAVE AGREED TO COME ON
THIS VOYAGE?"

 

  "BECAUSE I AM A SCIENTIST," SHOT BACK KALIININ AND SHE, TOO, ADDRESSED
BORANOVA. "BECAUSE I WANTED TO TEST THE EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL ELECTRICAL
PATTERNS ON BIOCHEMICAL INTERACTION. THAT HAS BEEN DONE, SO THAT FOR ME
THE VOYAGE WAS A SUCCESS, AND FOR ARKADY, SINCE THE SHIP HAS HANDLED AS
IT SHOULD, AND FOR ALBERT, SINCE THE EVIDENCE FOR HIS THEORIES IS
STRONGER NOW, I GATHER, THAN IT WAS BEFORE WE CAME HERE, AND FOR YOU,
NATALYA, SINCE YOU BROUGHT US DOWN HERE AND, PRESUMABLY, WILL BRING US
BACK SAFELY AGAIN. BUT FOR ONE" -- POINTING AT KONEV -- "IT HAS BEEN A
FAILURE AND THE MENTAL STABILITY OF HE WHO HAS FAILED WOULD BE GREATLY
HELPED BY THE FRANK ADMISSION OF THAT FAILURE."

 

  (SHE'S GETTING BACK AT HIM WITH A VENGEANCE, THOUGHT MORRISON.)

 

  BUT KONEV DID NOT CRUMPLE UNDER KALIININ'S FORCEFUL ATTACK. HE
REMAINED SURPRISINGLY CALM AND HE SAID, STILL TO BORANOVA, "THAT IS NOT
SO. THAT IS THE REVERSE OF WHAT IS TRUE. IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE START
THAT WE COULD NOT EXPECT SHAPIROV TO THINK AS HE DID WHEN HE WAS IN FULL
HEALTH. IT WAS ENTIRELY LIKELY WE WOULD GET BITS AND PIECES OF MEANING
INTERMINGLED WITH MEANINGLESSNESS AND TRIVIALITIES. THAT WE DID. I WAS
HOPING TO GET A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MEANING IN THIS NEW NEURON
IMMEDIATELY PAST THE SYNAPSE. THERE WE FAILED. THAT MAKES THE TASK
BEFORE US MORE DIFFICULT, BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

 

  "WE'VE GOT WELL OVER A HUNDRED PHRASES AND IMAGES WE'VE SALVAGED FROM
SHAPIROV'S THINKING. DON'T FORGET 'NU TIMES C EQUALS M SUB S,' WHICH
MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THERE'S NO POSSIBLE REASON TO THINK OF THAT SIMPLY
AS A TRIVIALITY."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "HAVE YOU THOUGHT, YURI, THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THAT
FRAGMENT OF A MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION REPRESENTS SOMETHING SHAPIROV
TRIED AND FOUND WANTING?"

 

  "I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT, BUT WHY SHOULD IT STICK IN HIS MIND, IN THAT
CASE? IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH INVESTIGATING. AND HOW MUCH OF WHAT SEEMS TO
BE TRIVIAL OR MEANINGLESS WOULD NOT BE SO IF EVEN ONE PHRASE OR IMAGE
GAVE US A NECESSARY HINT. WITH EACH STEP FORWARD, OTHER THINGS MIGHT
MORE EASILY FALL INTO PLACE. WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO REASON AS YET TO
DECLARE THIS VOYAGE A FAILURE -- OR ANY PART IN IT."

 

  BORANOVA NODDED SLIGHTLY. "WELL, LET'S HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, YURI, BUT,
AS ARKADY HAS ALREADY ASKED, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WHAT, IN YOUR OPINION,
OUGHT WE TO DO NOW?"

 

  WITH GREAT DELIBERATION, KONEV SAID, "THERE'S ONE THING WE HAVEN'T
TRIED YET. WE'VE TRIED DETECTION OUTSIDE THE NEURON, INSIDE THE NEURON,
INSIDE THE AXON, INSIDE THE DENDRITES, PAST THE SYNAPSE, BUT, IN EVERY
SINGLE CASE, WE HAVE TRIED IT INSIDE THE SHIP, INSIDE ITS PRESUMABLY
INSULATING WALLS."

 

  "IN THAT CASE, THEN," SAID BORANOVA, "ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT WE MAKE
THE ATTEMPT OUTSIDE THE SHIP AND WITHIN THE CELL FLUID ITSELF? REMEMBER,
SUCH AN OBSERVER WOULD STILL BE INSIDE A PLASTIC SUIT."

 

  "A PLASTIC SUIT IS NOT AS THICK AS A PLASTIC SHIP AND THE INSULATING
EFFECT WOULD PRESUMABLY BE LESS. BESIDES, THE COMPUTER ITSELF NEED NOT
BE INSIDE THE SUIT."

 

  MORRISON SAID WITH GATHERING ALARM, "WHO DO YOU HAVE IN MIND FOR
THIS?"

 

  KONEV LOOKED AT HIM COOLLY. "THERE IS ONLY ONE POSSIBILITY, ALBERT.
THE COMPUTER IS YOUR DESIGN AND IS MADE TO MATCH YOUR BRAIN. YOU ARE, OF
NECESSITY, THE MOST SENSITIVE TO SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS. IT WOULD BE
FOOLISH IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE TO SEND OUT ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE YOU IN
MIND FOR THIS, ALBERT."

 

  66.

 

  MORRISON'S STOMACH CLENCHED TIGHTLY. NOT THAT! HE COULDN'T BE ASKED TO
DO IT AGAIN!

 

  HE TRIED TO SAY SO, BUT HIS MOUTH SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED COMPLETELY AND
INSTANTANEOUSLY AND HE COULD MAKE NO SOUND OTHER THAN A THROATY HISS. IT
FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT HE HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO ENJOY THE FEELING
OF NOT BEING A COWARD, OF WANDERING, BY SHIP, THROUGH THE BRAIN CELL
FEARLESSLY -- BUT HE WAS A COWARD, AFTER ALL.

 

  "NOT THAT!" HE CRIED OUT, BUT IT WASN'T HIS VOICE; IT WAS HIGHER BY AN
OCTAVE. IT WAS KALIININ.

 

  SHE HAD TURNED AROUND TO FACE BORANOVA, HOLDING HERSELF DOWN IN HER
SEAT WITH KNUCKLES STANDING OUT WHITELY.

 

  "NOT THAT, NATALYA," SHE CRIED AGAIN PASSIONATELY, HER CHEST HEAVING
IN EXCITEMENT. "IT'S A COWARDLY SUGGESTION. POOR ALBERT HAS BEEN OUT
THERE ONCE ALREADY. HE NEARLY DIED AND IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM WE
MIGHT STILL BE LOST IN THE WRONG CAPILLARY AND WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE
REACHED THIS CELL BLOCK AT ALL. WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN? IT
IS SURELY SOMEONE ELSE'S TURN AND SINCE HE WANTS IT DONE" -- NO ONE
QUESTIONED WHO "HE" WAS -- "LET HIM DO IT. HE SHOULD NOT ASK IT OF
SOMEONE ELSE."

 

  MORRISON, BENEATH HIS OWN FRIGHT, WONDERED FAINTLY IF KALIININ'S
EMOTION WAS DUE TO A GROWING AFFECTION FOR HIM OR A DETERMINATION TO
OPPOSE AT EVERY POINT ANY STRONG WISH OF KONEV'S. THERE WAS A CORNER OF
MORRISON'S MIND THAT WAS PRAGMATIC ENOUGH TO BE CERTAIN IT WAS THE
LATTER.

 

  KONEV'S FACE HAD GROWN SLOWLY REDDER AS SOPHIA SPOKE. HE SAID,
"THERE'S NO COWARDICE HERE." (HE SPAT OUT THE WORD, MAKING IT QUITE
PLAIN THAT THAT WAS WHAT HAD MOST OFFENDED HIM.) "I AM MAKING THE ONLY
POSSIBLE SUGGESTION. IF I GO OUT THERE, WHICH I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO
DO, IT CAN ONLY BE WITH ALBERT'S DEVICE, WHICH WON'T WORK AS WELL FOR ME
AS IT WOULD FOR HIM. WE CANNOT CHOOSE THIS ONE OR THAT ONE ACCORDING TO
WHIM. IT MUST BE THE ONE WHO CAN GET THE BEST RESULTS AND THERE IS NO
QUESTION, IN THAT CASE, WHO IT MUST BE."

 

  "TRUE," SAID MORRISON, FINDING HIS VOICE NOW, "BUT THERE IS NO REASON
TO SUPPOSE THAT RECEPTION WILL BE BETTER OUTSIDE THE SHIP THAN INSIDE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THE REVERSE, EITHER. AND AS
DEZHNEV WILL TELL YOU, OUR ENERGY SUPPLY -- AND THEREFORE OUR TIME -- IS
DECREASING. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DELAY. YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THE SHIP AS
YOU DID BEFORE -- AND NOW."

 

  MORRISON SAID IN A LOW VOICE, WHICH HE HOPED WOULD MAKE THE REMARK
FINAL, "I'M SORRY. I WILL NOT LEAVE THE SHIP."

 

  BUT BORANOVA HAD APPARENTLY MADE UP HER MIND. "I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO, ALBERT," SHE SAID GENTLY.

 

  "NO."

 

  "YURI IS RIGHT. ONLY YOU AND YOUR DEVICE CAN GIVE US THE INFORMATION
WE NEED."

 

  "I AM CERTAIN THERE'LL BE NO INFORMATION."

 

  BORANOVA HELD OUT HER TWO HANDS, PALMS UPWARD. "PERHAPS NOT, BUT WE
CAN'T LEAVE THAT A MATTER OF CONJECTURE. LET US FIND OUT."

 

  "BUT --"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT, I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU DO THIS ONE THING
FOR US, YOUR PART IN ALL THIS WILL BE REPORTED HONESTLY WHEN THE TIME
COMES FOR OPEN PUBLICATION. YOU WILL BE KNOWN AS THE MAN WHO WORKED OUT
THE CORRECT THEORY OF THOUGHT, THE MAN WHO DEVELOPED THE DEVICE THAT
COULD EXPLOIT THAT THEORY PROPERLY, THE MAN WHO SAVED THE SHIP IN THE
CAPILLARY, AND THE MAN WHO DETECTED SHAPIROV'S THINKING BY BRAVELY
VENTURING INTO THE NEURON, AS EARLIER HE HAD VENTURED INTO THE
BLOODSTREAM."

 

  "ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT THE TRUTH WILL NOT BE TOLD IF I REFUSE?"

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED. "YOU FORCE ME TO PLAY THE ROLE OF VILLAINESS OPENLY.
I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE IMPLICATION. -- YES, THE
TRUTH NEED NOT BE TOLD. THAT, AFTER ALL, IS THE ONLY WEAPON I HOLD
AGAINST YOU. WE CANNOT VERY WELL TURN YOU OUT OF THE SHIP BY FORCE,
SINCE THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE IN YOUR MERELY BEING OUTSIDE. YOU MUST ALSO
SENSE POOR SHAPIROV'S THOUGHT AND FOR THAT WE MUST HAVE YOUR WILLING
COOPERATION. WE WILL REWARD YOU FOR THAT, BUT ONLY FOR THAT."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AROUND AT HIS CREWMATES' FACES, SEARCHING FOR HELP.
BORANOVA -- STEADILY STUDYING HIM. KONEV -- STARING HIM DOWN
IMPERIOUSLY. DEZHNEV -- LOOKING AWKWARD, NOT WILLING TO COMMIT HIMSELF
EITHER WAY. AND KALIININ ... HIS ONLY HOPE.

 

  MORRISON GAZED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY AND SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SOPHIA?"

 

  KALIININ HESITATED, THEN SAID IN A VOICE THAT DID NOT TREMBLE, "I
THINK IT IS WRONG TO THREATEN YOU IN THIS WAY. A TASK LIKE THIS SHOULD
BE PERFORMED VOLUNTARILY AND NOT UNDER DURESS."

 

  DEZHNEV, WHO HAD BEEN HUMMING VERY SOFTLY TO HIMSELF, NOW SAID, "MY
OLD FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THERE IS NO DURESS LIKE ONE'S OWN CONSCIENCE
AND IT IS THAT WHICH MAKES LIFE SO NEEDLESSLY BITTER.'"

 

  "MY CONSCIENCE DOESN'T TROUBLE ME IN THIS MATTER," SAID MORRISON.
"SHALL WE PUT IT TO A VOTE?"

 

  "IT WOULDN'T MATTER," SAID BORANOVA. "I AM THE CAPTAIN AND IN A CASE
LIKE THIS I ALONE HAVE THE VOTE."

 

  "IF I AM OUT THERE AND SENSE NOTHING, WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME?"

 

  BORANOVA NODDED. "I WOULD. AFTER ALL, YOU MIGHT SO EASILY INVENT
SOMETHING THAT WOULD SOUND USEFUL IF YOU WISHED US TO BE SUITABLY
GRATEFUL. IF YOU COME BACK WITH NOTHING OR WITH TRIVIA, I BELIEVE I
WOULD HAVE A GREATER TENDENCY TO BELIEVE THAT THAN IF YOU INSTANTLY
CLAIMED YOU HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "I AM NOT LIKELY TO BE FOOLED. IF HE COMES IN WITH
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT, I WILL BE ABLE TO TELL IF IT TRULY IS.
AND NOW, SURELY, WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH DISCUSSION. LET'S GO!"

 

  AND MORRISON, HIS HEART BEATING AND HIS THROAT TIGHTENING, MANAGED TO
SAY, "VERY WELL, I WILL GO -- BUT ONLY FOR A BRIEF TIME."

 

  67.

 

  MORRISON, OF HIS OWN ACCORD, STRIPPED HIMSELF OF HIS COTTON GARMENT.
THE FIRST TIME (WAS IT REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE?) IT HAD
SEEMED TO BE A VIOLATION OF MODESTY; THIS SECOND TIME IT WAS ALMOST
ROUTINE.

 

  HE WAS QUITE AWARE, AS WITH KALIININ'S HELP HE STRUGGLED INTO THE
SUIT, HOW EASILY HE COULD SUCK IN HIS ABDOMEN. DESPITE A GOOD BREAKFAST,
AMPLE WATER, AND A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE, HIS STOMACH WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS
GLAD IT WAS. HE FELT A TWINGE OF NAUSEA AS THE SUIT ENCLOSED MORE AND
MORE OF HIS BODY AND TO THROW UP, ONCE ENCLOSED, WOULD HAVE BEEN
UNBEARABLE. JUST BEFORE ENCLOSURE, HE REFUSED ANOTHER PIECE OF CHOCOLATE
WITH WHAT WAS ALMOST A SHUDDER.

 

  THEY PUT HIS COMPUTER INTO HIS SHEATHED HANDS AND BORANOVA SAID TO HIM
LOUDLY, "CAN YOU WORK IT?"

 

  MORRISON HEARD HER WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY. HE KNEW HE WOULDN'T
HEAR HER ONCE HE WAS OUTSIDE THE SHIP. HE BALANCED THE ESSENTIALLY
WEIGHTLESS COMPUTER IN ONE HAND AND STRUCK THE KEYS CAREFULLY AND RATHER
GRACELESSLY WITH THE OTHER. HE SHOUTED BACK, "I THINK I CAN MANAGE."

 

  THEN, RATHER CLUMSILY, THEY TIED THE COMPUTER TO BOTH HIS WRISTS WITH
FIRM KNOTS OF TOUGH PLASTIC TWINE (PROBABLY THE SAME MATERIAL OF WHICH
THE SUIT AND THE SHIP ITSELF WERE MADE).

 

  "SO YOU DON'T LOSE IT," BORANOVA CALLED OUT.

 

  OUT INTO THE AIR LOCK HE WENT. HE FELT HIMSELF EMBRACED BY IT, THEN
PRESSURED AS THE AIR IN IT WAS WITHDRAWN, AND THEN HE WAS OUTSIDE THE
SHIP.

 

  OUTSIDE AGAIN. FOR ONLY A BRIEF TIME, HE HAD WARNED THE REST, BUT WHAT
GOOD WAS THAT? HOW COULD HE ENFORCE THAT, IF THE OTHERS WITHIN THE SHIP
REFUSED TO LET HIM BACK IN? ALREADY, HE WAS SORRY HE HAD LET HIMSELF BE
TALKED OUT OF THE SHIP BY ANY THREAT, BUT DARED NOT ARTICULATE THE
THOUGHT. IT WOULD DO HIM NO GOOD.

 

  MORRISON TUCKED THE COMPUTER UNDER HIS LEFT ARM, PARTLY BECAUSE HE DID
NOT ENTIRELY TRUST THE PLASTIC TWINE THAT SECURED IT AND PARTLY BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO PROTECT IT FROM THE CELLULAR CONTENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
HE FELT THE SURFACE OF THE SHIP FOR SOME SPOT WHERE THE ELECTRIC CHARGE
ON HIS SUIT WOULD ADHERE TO A CHARGE OF OPPOSITE NATURE ON THE SHIP'S
HULL.

 

  MORRISON FOUND ONE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO KEEP HIS BACK ON THE SHIP. THE
ELECTRIC FIELD DID NOT HOLD HIM TIGHTLY AND THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE GIVE.
STILL, HE WAS THE SIZE OF AN ATOM AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO
CONCENTRATE ELECTRIC CHARGE ON A PORTION OF HIM.

 

  OR WOULD IT BE? WOULDN'T THE ELECTRONS THAT WERE THE SOURCE OF THE
CHARGE BE MICROMINIATURIZED AS WELL? HE FELT -- AND RESENTED KEENLY --
HIS IGNORANCE OF MINIATURIZATION THEORY.

 

  HE WAS LITTLE AWARE OF HIS MOTION ALONG THE INTRACELLULAR STREAM, FOR
EVERYTHING WAS MOVING ALONG WITH HIM. HE FOUND HIMSELF, HOWEVER, THE
CENTER OF A SHIFTING AND EVER-CHANGING PANORAMA. WITH THE THINNER
PLASTIC OF THE SUIT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE SCENE, WITH THE BEACON OF
HIS OWN SUIT TURNING HERE AND THERE AS HE MOVED HIS HEAD AND FELT THE
HEADPIECE TWIST (A LITTLE RESISTANTLY) WITH IT, HE COULD MAKE OUT MORE.

 

  THERE WAS THE KNOBBINESS OF THE WATER MOLECULES RUBBING AGAINST EACH
OTHER, LIKE DIMLY SEEN BALLOONS. HE COULD SEE THEM BRUSH PAST HIM
SLOWLY, THIS WAY OR THAT, AND LARGELY IGNORE HIM. OCCASIONALLY, ONE
WOULD CLING FOR A MOMENT, AN ELECTRIC CHARGE MEETING AN OPPOSITE CHARGE
ON HIS SUIT, SO THAT THEY CLUTCHED AT HIM AND RELEASED THEIR HOLD ONLY
LINGERINGLY. IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH A MOLECULE OCCASIONALLY YEARNED FOR
HIM BUT COULDN'T MANAGE TO TURN THE WISH INTO DEED.

 

  AMONG THESE WERE LARGER MOLECULES, SOME AS LARGE AS THE SHIP, SOME FAR
LARGER STILL. HE COULD SEE THEM ONLY BECAUSE LIGHT GLINTED OFF THEM HERE
AND THERE IN CHANGING, PRISMATIC FASHION. HE DID NOT SEE THEM; HIS MIND
BUILT THEM UP OUT OF WHAT HE COULD GLIMPSE. THAT HE COULD DO THIS AT ALL
WAS THE RESULT OF HIS KNOWING A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE CELL
TO BEGIN WITH, OR THOUGHT HE DID. IT MIGHT ALSO, HE THOUGHT, SIMPLY BE
HIS IMAGINATION.

 

  IT EVEN SEEMED TO MORRISON THAT HE COULD MAKE OUT THE SKELETON OF THE
CELLULAR INTERIOR; THE LARGE STRUCTURES THAT REMAINED IN PLACE WHILE THE
FLUID STREAM PASSED THEM AND THAT GAVE THE CELL ITS MORE OR LESS FIXED
SHAPE. THESE STRUCTURES SEEMED TO GO BY SO QUICKLY HE COULD BARELY TAKE
NOTE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE GONE. THEY ALONE GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION
OF THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF THE INTERCELLULAR STREAM THAT CARRIED THE SHIP
AND HIM ALONG WITH IT AS IT WEAVED IN GENTLE SWOOPS AROUND THOSE FIXED
STRUCTURES.

 

  ALL THIS OBSERVATION HAD NOT TAKEN VERY LONG, BUT IT WAS ENOUGH. IT
WAS TIME THAT HE NOW TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO HIS COMPUTER.

 

  WHY? IT WOULD DETECT NOTHING. MORRISON WAS SURE OF IT, BUT HE COULDN'T
ACT ON THAT BELIEF, HOWEVER STRONGLY HE FELT IT. HE MIGHT BE WRONG,
PERHAPS, AND HE OWED IT TO THE OTHERS -- AND TO HIMSELF, TOO -- TO MAKE
THE EFFORT.

 

  HE TRIED CLUMSILY TO ADJUST THE COMPUTER TO MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY,
BARELY ABLE TO HANDLE THE KEYS CORRECTLY AND RELIEVED THAT THE
SELF-CONTAINED POWER PACK IN THE COMPUTER WORKED PROPERLY. HE
CONCENTRATED HARD IN ORDER TO SENSE AND TAP THE CURRENTS OF THOUGHT
PASSING BY.

 

  THE DEVICE DID ITS WORK. THE WATER MOLECULES DRIFTED BY IT AS GENTLY
AND UNTOUCHINGLY AS THEY DRIFTED BY HIM AND, DISREGARDING THEM, HIS
COMPUTER PORTRAYED THE SKEPTIC WAVES MORE PURELY ETCHED, MORE STEEP AND
CLEAR, MORE FINELY DETAILED, THAN HE HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN THEM. BUT FOR
ALL THAT, HE SENSED NOTHING BUT A FAINT HISSING WHISPER THAT PRODUCED
NEITHER WORDS NOR IMAGES BUT ONLY SADNESS.

 

  WAIT! HOW DID HE KNOW THE WHISPER WAS SAD? SURELY THAT WAS MERELY A
SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT ON HIS PART. OR WAS HE DETECTING AN EMOTION? WAS THE
PARTIALLY BRAIN-DEAD, TOTALLY COMATOSE SHAPIROV SAD? WOULD IT BE
SURPRISING IF HE WERE?

 

  MORRISON LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER, BACK AT THE SHIP. SURELY WHAT HE
WAS DETECTING WAS ENOUGH. HE WAS REGISTERING SAD NOTHINGNESS AND NOTHING
MORE. SHOULD HE SIGNAL NOW TO BE PULLED IN? WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO DO
SO? AND IF THEY BROUGHT HIM IN AND IF HE TOLD BORANOVA THAT HE HAD
SENSED NOTHING, WOULD NOT KONEV TELL HIM ANGRILY THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT
THERE ONLY TWO MINUTES, THAT HE HADN'T GIVEN IT A CHANCE? WOULD KONEV
NOT DEMAND HE GO OUT AGAIN?

 

  AND IF HE WAITED LONGER?

 

  ACTUALLY, HE COULD WAIT LONGER. AT THIS STAGE OF MINIATURIZATION (OR
FOR WHATEVER CAUSE), HE DID NOT FEEL ANY PARTICULAR HEAT.

 

  BUT IF HE WAITED LONGER -- ANOTHER TWO MINUTES, OR FIVE MINUTES, OR AN
HOUR, FOR THAT MATTER -- KONEV WOULD STILL SAY, "NOT ENOUGH."

 

  HE COULD MAKE OUT KONEV LOOKING OUT TOWARD HIM, HIS EXPRESSION DARK
AND GLOWERING. KALIININ WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM, SINCE SHE HAD UNCLASPED
HERSELF AND MOVED OVER INTO WHAT HAD BEEN MORRISON'S SEAT. SHE WAS
STARING OUTWARD ANXIOUSLY.

 

  HE CAUGHT HER EYES AND SHE SEEMED ABOUT TO SIGNAL TO HIM, BUT BORANOVA
LEANED FORWARD AND PUSHED HER SHOULDER FIRMLY. KALIININ MOVED BACK TO
HER OWN SEAT AT ONCE. (SHE HAD TO, MORRISON TOLD HIMSELF, FOR HER JOB
WAS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE CHARGE PATTERNS OF THE SHIP AND OF HIMSELF
RIGHT NOW AND SHE COULD NOT -- MUST NOT -- ABANDON THAT JOB, NO MATTER
WHAT HER ANXIETY OVER HIM.)

 

  FOR THE SAKE OF COMPLETENESS, MORRISON TRIED TO CATCH DEZHNEV'S EYE,
BUT THE ANGLE REQUIRED WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE TWISTING ABILITY OF HIS
HEADPIECE. HE CAUGHT, INSTEAD, KONEV MOTIONING IN WHAT SEEMED, CLEARLY,
AN INTERROGATIVE GESTURE.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AWAY PETULANTLY, MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO GIVE
INFORMATION, AND BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE LOOMING
TOWARD HIM AT A GREAT SPEED. HE COULD MAKE OUT NO DETAILS, BUT HE
AUTOMATICALLY WINCED AS HE WAITED FOR THE CURRENT TO CARRY THE SHIP AND
HIMSELF AROUND IT.

 

  IT CAME STRAIGHT ON LIKE A JUGGERNAUT AND MORRISON COWERED TOWARD THE
HULL OF THE SHIP.

 

  THE SHIP DID EVADE THE OBJECT, BUT NOT BY MUCH AND AS THE LOOMING
MONSTER PASSED HIM MORRISON FELT HIMSELF DRAWN OUTWARD AND TOWARD IT.

 

  IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT KALIININ HAD PUT SOME RANDOM ELECTRIC
CHARGE ON HIS SUIT AND THAT WHATEVER IT WAS HE WAS PASSING, BY THE MOST
MISERABLE OF COINCIDENCES, HAD A CHARGE THAT EXACTLY COMPLEMENTED HIS
OWN.

 

  UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED. THE SHIP AND
THE STRUCTURE PASSED EACH OTHER AT SUCH A SPEED THAT NO ATTRACTION COULD
HAVE SUFFICED TO RIP HIM LOOSE, BUT HE WAS A TINY OBJECT WITH NEITHER
MASS NOR INERTIA AND, FOR A MOMENT, HE FELT -- STRETCHED -- AS THOUGH
THE STRUCTURE AND THE SHIP DISPUTED OWNERSHIP. THE SHIP, IT SEEMED TO
HIS APPALLED EYES, BRIEFLY FALTERED AND THEN WAS PUSHED LOOSE BY THE
CURRENT.

 

  MORRISON HAD BEEN PEELED OFF BY THE OBJECT AND THE SHIP, STILL
CONTINUING WITH THE CURRENT, MOVED OFF SO RAPIDLY THAT IT WAS LOST TO
SIGHT AT ONCE. ONE SECOND IT WAS WITH HIM, THE NEXT SECOND IT WAS
TOTALLY GONE.

 

  BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED, HE WAS ALONE AND
HELPLESS -- AN ATOM-SIZED OBJECT IN A BRAIN CELL. HIS ONLY FAINT
ATTACHMENT TO LIFE AND REALITY -- THE SHIP -- WAS FOREVER GONE.

 

  68.

 

  SOME MINUTES MUST HAVE BEEN LOST TO MORRISON. DURING THAT TIME, HE HAD
NO CONCEPTION OF WHERE HE WAS OR OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE WAS CONSCIOUS
ONLY OF ABSOLUTE PANIC, OF THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF
DEATH.

 

  WHEN LIFE CONTINUED, MORRISON WAS ALMOST SORRY. IF THAT MOMENT HAD
BEEN DEATH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER. NOW HE STILL HAD TO WAIT FOR
IT.

 

  HOW LONG WOULD HIS AIR LAST? WOULD HEAT AND HUMIDITY CRAWL ON, EVEN IF
MORE SLOWLY THAN BEFORE, INEXORABLY, JUST THE SAME, PERHAPS. WOULD HIS
LIGHT GIVE OUT BEFORE HE DID AND WOULD HE HAVE TO DIE IN UTTER DARKNESS
AS WELL AS UTTERLY ALONE? HE THOUGHT, QUITE MADLY, HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN
I'M DEAD IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY DARK BEFORE AND ABSOLUTELY DARK THEREAFTER?
(HE THOUGHT OF AJAX'S PRAYER TO ZEUS THAT IF HE HAD TO MEET DEATH, LET
IT BE IN THE LIGHT OF DAY. AND, WITH THIS, MORRISON THOUGHT HOPELESSLY,
AND WITH ONE PERSON, AT LEAST, TO HOLD ONE'S HAND.)

 

  WHAT TO DO, THEN?

 

  JUST WAIT?

 

  WHAT HAD GONE WRONG, ANYWAY?

 

  AH, HE WAS NOT YET DEAD. THE FEAR HAD RECEDED ENOUGH TO ALLOW ROOM FOR
A LITTLE CURIOSITY -- AND A WILL TO FIGHT AND LIVE.

 

  COULD HE SOMEHOW GET LOOSE FROM THIS THING? IT SEEMED DISGRACEFUL,
SOMEHOW, TO DIE LIKE A FLY STUCK IN AMBER. -- AND EVERY MOMENT THE SHIP
WAS GETTING FARTHER AWAY. ALMOST AT ONCE HE THOUGHT, IT'S ALREADY TOO
FAR AWAY FOR ME TO BE CAUGHT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

 

  THE THOUGHT DROVE HIM TO FRENZY AND MORRISON WRITHED WITH ALL HIS
MIGHT, TRYING TO BREAK LOOSE. IT DID NO GOOD AND IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT
HE WAS WASTING ENERGY AND INCREASING THE HEAT WITHIN THE SUIT.

 

  HE SLID HIS HANDS UPWARD ALONG THE MISTY STRUCTURE THAT HELD HIM, BUT
HIS HANDS BOUNCED AWAY. LIKE CHARGES REPEL EACH OTHER.

 

  HE REACHED ALONG IT -- RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN. SOMEWHERE THERE WAS THE
OPPOSITE CHARGE. HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEIZE HOLD THEN AND TRY TO TEAR THE
STRUCTURE APART. (WHY WERE HIS TEETH CHATTERING? FRIGHT? DESPERATION?
BOTH?)

 

  HIS RIGHT HAND CLICKED SHUT AS IT WAS ATTRACTED TO A PORTION OF THE
STRUCTURE. HE CLENCHED HARD, TRYING TO PUSH PAST THE MERE CHARGE AND
TEAR AT THE ATOMIC ARRANGEMENT ITSELF -- IF THERE WAS ANY ATOMIC
ARRANGEMENT THAT HAD MEANING ASIDE FROM THE CHARGE ITSELF.

 

  FOR A MOMENT, MORRISON FELT THE STRUCTURE RESIST A TOO-TIGHT GRIP WITH
A KIND OF RUBBERY REBOUND. AND THEN, WITHOUT WARNING, IT CRUMBLED IN HIS
HAND. HE STARED IN AMAZEMENT AT HIS HAND, TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHAT HAD
HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO TEARING, RIPPING, OR WRENCHING SENSATION. IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT A PORTION OF THE STRUCTURE HAD SIMPLY DISAPPEARED.

 

  MORRISON TRIED AGAIN, GROPING HERE AND THERE, UNTIL ANOTHER PORTION
VANISHED. WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

 

  WAIT AWHILE! THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD EXTENDED BEYOND THE SHIP
SLIGHTLY, BORANOVA HAD SAID. IT WOULD EXTEND BEYOND THE SUIT, TOO. WHEN
HE SQUEEZED AS HARD AS HE MIGHT, SOME OF THE ATOM HE WAS TOUCHING WOULD
MINIATURIZE AND, IN SO DOING, IT WOULD LOSE ITS NORMAL ARCHITECTURE AND
BREAK LOOSE FROM THE ATOMS TO WHICH IT HAD FORMERLY BEEN BONDED.
ANYTHING HE TOUCHED -- IF HE COULD TOUCH IT HARD ENOUGH -- WOULD
MINIATURIZE.

 

  ANY ATOM OR PORTION THEREOF THAT HE MINIATURIZED IN THIS WAY WOULD
BECOME A POINT-SIZED PARTICLE WITH FAR LESS MASS THAN AN ELECTRON. IT
WOULD TAKE OFF AT NEARLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT, PASS THROUGH MATTER AS
THOUGH THAT MATTER WEREN'T THERE, AND BE GONE.

 

  COULD THIS BE SO? IT HAD TO BE SO. NOTHING ELSE HE COULD IMAGINE WOULD
MAKE SENSE.

 

  AND EVEN AS HE THOUGHT THIS, MORRISON BEGAN TO PUSH HIS HANDS AND FEET
VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE IMPRISONING MATERIAL -- AND BROKE LOOSE.

 

  HE WAS NO LONGER GLUED TO THE STRUCTURE. HE WAS AN INDEPENDENT BODY
COURSING ALONG THE INTERCELLULAR STREAM.

 

  IT DIDN'T STOP THE SHIP FROM BEING FOREVER OUT OF REACH, BUT HE WAS AT
LEAST ON ITS TRAIL. (FOOLISH! FOOLISH! WHAT GOOD WAS IT TO BE ON ITS
TRAIL? ON HIS OWN SCALE, HE WAS DOZENS OF KILOMETERS FROM THE SHIP -- IF
NOT SCORES.)

 

  ANOTHER THOUGHT STRUCK HIM AND STAGGERED HIM. HE HAD BEEN
MINIATURIZING ATOMS TO GET FREE, BUT SUCH MINIATURIZATION REQUIRED AN
INPUT OF ENERGY. NOT MUCH AT THIS STAGE, SINCE THERE WAS SO LITTLE MASS
TO REMOVE, BUT WHERE WOULD THE ENERGY COME FROM?

 

  IT HAD TO COME FROM THE SUIT'S OWN MINIATURIZATION FIELD. EVERY ATOM
THAT MINIATURIZED WEAKENED THE FIELD, THEREFORE. HOW MUCH HAD HE
WEAKENED IT, THEN, BY GETTING LOOSE?

 

  AND WAS THAT WHY HE WASN'T FEELING THE HEAT? HAD THE MINIATURIZATION
OF HIS SURROUNDINGS SOAKED UP SOME OF THE HEAT AS WELL AS OF THE ENERGY
OF THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD? NO, THAT COULDN'T BE SO, FOR HE HADN'T
FELT MUCH IN THE WAY OF HEAT EVEN BEFORE HE BEGAN BREAKING LOOSE.

 

  YET ANOTHER THOUGHT STRUCK HIM, MAKING HIS POSITION MORE DESPERATE
STILL. IF HE HAD BROKEN LOOSE FROM THE STRUCTURE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE
ENERGY OF HIS FIELD -- IF HIS FIELD HAD BEEN WEAKENED -- THEN HE WOULD
HAVE DEMINIATURIZED SLIGHTLY. WAS THAT THE REASON FOR SPONTANEOUS
DEMINIATURIZATION?

 

  BORANOVA HAD TALKED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH SPONTANEOUS
DEMINIATURIZATION. THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT INCREASED, THE SMALLER THE
MINIATURIZED OBJECT WAS. -- AND HE WAS NOW SMALL.

 

  AS LONG AS HE HAD BEEN ON THE SHIP, HE HAD BEEN PART OF THE OVERALL
MINIATURIZATION FIELD OF THE SHIP. HE WAS PART OF A MOLECULE-SIZED
OBJECT. WHILE HE WAS PART OF THE CYTOSKELETON OF THE CELL, HE WAS PART
OF AN EVEN LARGER OBJECT. BUT NOW HE WAS ALONE, SEPARATE, PART OF
NOTHING BEYOND HIMSELF. HE WAS AN ATOM-SIZED OBJECT.

 

  HE WAS MUCH MORE LIKELY, NOW, TO DEMINIATURIZE SPONTANEOUSLY, EXCEPT
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE SPONTANEOUS -- IT WOULD BE THE WEAKENING OF THE
FIELD BY THE MINIATURIZATION OF SURROUNDING NORMAL OBJECTS.

 

  HOW COULD HE TELL IF HE WERE DEMINIATURIZING? IF HE WERE, THE PROCESS
WOULD PROCEED AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE. HE WOULD BE DEMINIATURIZING SLOWLY
AT FIRST, BUT AS HE GREW LARGER HE WOULD AFFECT A LARGER VOLUME OF
SURROUNDING MATERIAL AND HE WOULD GROW LARGER AT A FASTER RATE, THEN
STILL FASTER, AND FINALLY IT WOULD BE AN EXPLOSION AND HE WOULD DIE.

 

  BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WERE DEMINIATURIZING? IF HE WERE, THEN,
IN A BRIEF TIME -- SECONDS MERELY, AT MOST -- HE WOULD BE DEAD AND IT
WOULD HAPPEN TOO QUICKLY TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION UPON HIM. ONE MOMENT HE
WOULD BE ALIVE AND THE NEXT MOMENT THERE WOULD BE NOTHINGNESS.

 

  HOW COULD HE ASK FOR A BETTER DEATH? WHY SHOULD HE WANT TO KNOW A
SECOND EARLIER THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

 

  BECAUSE HE WAS ALIVE AND HE WAS HUMAN -- AND WANTING TO KNOW WAS WHAT
MADE AN OBJECT ALIVE AND HUMAN.

 

  HOW COULD HE TELL?

 

  MORRISON STARED AT THE DIM GLINTING AROUND HIM, AT THE MOVING SWELL OF
THE WATER MOLECULES, TURNING AND SHIFTING AROUND HIM IN A KIND OF SLOW
MOTION AS BOTH HE AND THEY MOVED ALONG THE INTERCELLULAR STREAM.

 

  IF HE WERE INCREASING IN SIZE, THEY SHOULD SEEM TO BE DECREASING, AND
VICE VERSA.

 

  MORRISON STARED. THEY WERE DECREASING IN SIZE, GETTING SMALLER. WAS
THIS DEATH? OR HIS IMAGINATION?

 

  WAIT, WERE THE WATER MOLECULES INCREASING IN SIZE? SWELLING? GETTING
LARGER? BALLOONING? IF SO, IT MUST FOLLOW THAT HE WAS GETTING SMALLER.

 

  WOULD HE SHRINK TO THE SIZE OF A SUBSUBATOMIC PARTICLE? A SUBELECTRON?
WOULD HE GO STREAKING OFF AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND EXPLODE WHEN HE WAS
HALFWAY TO THE MOON, DYING IN A VACUUM BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO KNOW HE WAS
IN A VACUUM?

 

  NO, THE MOLECULES WERE SHRINKING, NOT EXPANDING -- MORRISON CLOSED HIS
EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH. HE WAS GOING MAD. OR WAS HE BEGINNING TO
EXPERIENCE BRAIN DAMAGE?

 

  BETTER TO DIE, THEN. BETTER DEATH ALTOGETHER THAN A DEAD BRAIN AND
LIVING BODY.

 

  OR WERE THE WATER MOLECULES PULSATING? WHY SHOULD THEY PULSATE?

 

  THINK, MORRISON, THINK. YOU'RE A SCIENTIST. FIND AN EXPLANATION. WHY
SHOULD THEY PULSATE?

 

  HE KNEW WHY THE FIELD MIGHT WEAKEN -- ITS TENDENCY TO MINIATURIZE THE
SURROUNDINGS. WHY SHOULD IT STRENGTHEN?

 

  IT WOULD HAVE TO GAIN ENERGY TO STRENGTHEN. FROM WHERE?

 

  WHAT ABOUT THE SURROUNDING MOLECULES? THEY HAD MORE RANDOM HEAT ENERGY
PER VOLUME THAN HE HAD BECAUSE THEY WERE AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE.
ORDINARILY, HEAT SHOULD FLOW FROM THE SURROUNDINGS INTO HIS SUIT UNTIL
HIS SUIT AND HE HIMSELF WOULD BE AT BLOOD TEMPERATURE AND HE WOULD DIE
OF HIS OWN INABILITY TO RID HIMSELF OF THE HEAT HE HAD ACCUMULATED, AS
HE ALMOST HAD ON HIS EARLIER VENTURE OUTSIDE THE SHIP.

 

  BUT THERE WAS NOT ONLY THE HEAT ENERGY INTENSITY OF HIS BODY; THERE
WAS ALSO THE ENERGY OF THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD. AND, AS HE WAS STRUCK
RANDOMLY BY THE WATER MOLECULES, ENERGY NEED NOT FLOW INTO HIM IN THE
FORM OF HEAT, BUT IN THE FORM OF MINIATURIZATION ACTIVATION. THE FIELD
WOULD GROW MORE INTENSE AND HE WOULD SHRINK.

 

  THIS MUST BE TRUE AT ALL TIMES WHEN A MINIATURIZED OBJECT WAS
SURROUNDED BY NORMAL OBJECTS OF HIGHER TEMPERATURE. THE ENERGY MIGHT
FLOW FROM THE SURROUNDINGS TO THE MINIATURIZED OBJECT EITHER AS HEAT OR
AS FIELD INTENSITY. AND IT MUST BE THAT THE SMALLER THE OBJECT, THE MORE
INTENSELY MINIATURIZED, THE MORE IT WAS THE FIELD THAT GAINED THE ENERGY
AND NOT THE OBJECT ITSELF.

 

  PROBABLY THE SHIP, TOO, WAS PULSATING, GROWING LARGER AND SMALLER
CONSTANTLY, BUT TO AN EXTENT NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO NOTICE. STILL, THAT WAS
WHY THE BROWNIAN MOTION HADN'T INCREASED AS FAR AS IT MIGHT HAVE AND
THAT WAS WHY THE AIR-CONDITIONING COULD PERFORM ITS FUNCTION WITH LESS
STRAIN. THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD FORMED A CUSHION IN BOTH CASES.

 

  BUT HE -- MORRISON, ALONE IN THE CELL -- WAS MUCH SMALLER, POSSESSING
LESS MASS, AND FOR HIM THE ENERGY INFLOW WENT FAR MORE INTO
MINIATURIZATION THAN HEAT.

 

  MORRISON'S FISTS CLENCHED HELPLESSLY. HE LET GO OF THE COMPUTER AND
DIDN'T CARE. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE OTHERS, BORANOVA AND KONEV CERTAINLY, KNEW
OF THIS AND MIGHT HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO HIM. ONCE AGAIN THEY LET HIM GO
INTO DANGER WITHOUT WARNING HIM.

 

  AND NOW THAT HE HAD WORKED IT OUT FOR HIMSELF -- WHAT GOOD DID IT DO
HIM?

 

  HE OPENED HIS EYES SUDDENLY.

 

  YES, THERE WERE PULSATIONS. NOW THAT HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT, HE SAW
THEM. THE WATER MOLECULES WERE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING IN AN IRREGULAR
RHYTHM AS THEY GAVE UP ENERGY TO THE FIELD AND THEN EXTRACTED ENERGY
FROM IT. I

 

  MORRISON WATCHED IT WITH A STUPEFIED SWAYING RHYTHM AND HE FOUND
HIMSELF MUTTERING SOUNDLESSLY: "LARGER, SMALLER, LARGER, SMALLER,
LARGER, SMALLER."

 

  IT COULD ONLY GET SO LARGE, HE THOUGHT. THE EXPANSION MIRRORED HIS OWN
CONTRACTION AND THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH ENERGY TO BE PUSHED INTO HIM TO
POWER THAT CONTRACTION. THE CELLULAR CONTENTS HAD A TEMPERATURE ONLY SO
HIGH. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY COULD TAKE LARGE QUANTITIES OF ENERGY FROM
HIM, AND ONCE THEY TOOK ENOUGH, WHAT WAS LEFT WOULD GO MORE AND MORE
QUICKLY, AND HE WOULD EXPLODE.

 

  THEREFORE, WHEN THE WATER MOLECULES EXPANDED IN SIZE (AND HE HIMSELF
WAS GROWING SMALLER) HE WAS SAFE. HE WOULD NOT GROW VERY SMALL. WHEN THE
WATER MOLECULES CONTRACTED IN SIZE, HOWEVER (AND HE HIMSELF WAS GROWING
LARGER), HE WAS NOT SAFE. IF THE WATER MOLECULES CONTINUED TO CONTRACT
UNTIL THEY WERE TOO SMALL TO SEE THAT MEANT HE WOULD BE EXPANDING TOWARD
INSTANTANEOUS EXPLOSION.

 

  "LARGER, SMALLER -- SMALLER -- STOP CONTRACTING!"

 

  MORRISON LET HIS BREATH GO, FOR THE MOLECULES WERE EXPANDING AGAIN.

 

  OVER AND OVER! EACH TIME -- WOULD THE CONTRACTION STOP?

 

  IT SEEMED TO BE PLAYING WITH HIM AND IT DIDN'T MATTER ANYWAY. NO
MATTER IF IT BROUGHT HIM TO THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION, THEN SNATCHED HIM
AWAY, AND IF IT DID IT A MILLION TIMES OVER, IT WOULDN'T MATTER. SOONER
OR LATER, HIS AIR WOULD BE GONE AND HE WOULD DIE A SLOW, SUFFOCATING
DEATH.

 

  BETTER A QUICK DEATH, SURELY.

 

  69.

 

  KALIININ WAS SCREAMING. SHE WAS THE FIRST TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND SHE CHOKED ON HER WORDS.

 

  "HE'S GONE! HE'S GONE!" SHE SHRIEKED.

 

  BORANOVA WAS UNABLE TO STOP HERSELF FROM ASKING THE OBVIOUS QUESTION.
"WHO'S GONE?"

 

  KALIININ TURNED WIDE EYES ON HER AND SAID, "WHO'S GONE? HOW CAN YOU
ASK WHO'S GONE? ALBERT IS GONE."

 

  BORANOVA STARED BLANKLY OUT AT THE SPOT WHERE MORRISON HAD BEEN AND
NOW WASN'T. "WHAT HAPPENED?"

 

  DEZHNEV MUTTERED HOARSELY, "I'M NOT SURE. WE CUT A CORNER CLOSELY.
ALBERT, ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP, INTRODUCED AN ASYMMETRY,
PERHAPS. I TRIED TO STEER THE SHIP AWAY FROM -- FROM WHATEVER IT WAS,
BUT IT DIDN'T RESPOND PROPERLY."

 

  "A FIXED MACROMOLECULAR ORGANELLE," SAID KONEV, WHO LOOKED UP NOW
AFTER HAVING BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS, "SCRAPED HIM OFF. WE'VE GOT
TO GET BACK TO HIM. HE MAY HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED."

 

  BORANOVA BY NOW CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THE SITUATION. SHE UNCLASPED
HERSELF WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT AND STOOD UP. "INFORMATION?" SHE SAID
TIGHTLY. "IS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL THE LOSS OF, YURI? INFORMATION? DO YOU
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW? ALBERT'S MINIATURIZATION FIELD IS
ISOLATED AND HE'S ONLY ATOM-SIZED. THE CHANCE OF HIS UNDERGOING
SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION IS AT LEAST FIFTY TIMES OURS. GIVEN ENOUGH
TIME, THE CHANCE WILL BECOME TOO GOOD. INFORMATION OR NOT, WE MUST GET
HIM. IF HE DEMINIATURIZES, HE WILL KILL SHAPIROV AND HE WILL KILL US."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WE'RE JUST ARGUING MOTIVATION. WE BOTH WANT HIM BACK. THE
REASONS WHY ARE SECONDARY."

 

  "WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE SENT HIM OUT," SAID KALIININ. "I KNEW IT WAS
WRONG TO DO SO."

 

  "IT IS DONE," SAID BORANOVA GRUFFLY, "AND WE MUST PROCEED FROM THAT
POINT. ARKADY!"

 

  "I'M TRYING," SAID DEZHNEV. "DON'T TEACH A DRUNKARD TO HICCUP."

 

  "I'M NOT TRYING TO TEACH YOU ANYTHING, OLD FOOL. I'M ORDERING YOU.
TURN AROUND. BACK! BACK!"

 

  "NO," SAID DEZHNEV. "LET THIS OLD FOOL TELL YOU THAT'S RIDICULOUS. DO
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A U-TURN AND BUCK THE CURRENT? YOU WANT ME TO TRY TO
FORCE MY WAY UPSTREAM?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IF YOU JUST STAND STILL, THE STREAM WILL BRING HIM TO
US."

 

  "HE IS ADHERING TO SOMETHING. HE WILL NOT BE BROUGHT TO US," SAID
DEZHNEV. "WHAT WE MUST DO IS TURN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DENDRITE AND
LET THE RETURN STREAM CARRY US BACK."

 

  BORANOVA PUT BOTH HANDS TO HER HEAD AND SAID, "I APOLOGIZE FOR CALLING
YOU AN OLD FOOL, ARKADY, BUT IF WE GO BACK BY THE COUNTERSTREAM WE'LL
MISS HIM."

 

  "WE HAVE NO CHOICE," SAID DEZHNEV. "WE LACK THE ENERGY TO TRY TO MAKE
OUR WAY AGAINST THE STREAM WE'RE IN."

 

  KONEV SAID, SOUNDING A BIT WEARY BUT REASONABLE, "LET ARKADY DO AS HE
WISHES, NATALYA. WE WILL NOT LOSE ALBERT."

 

  "HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT, YURI?"

 

  "BECAUSE I CAN HEAR HIM. -- OR, RATHER, SENSE HIM. -- OR, RATHER,
SENSE SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS BY WAY OF HIS INSTRUMENT, BARE AND UNINSULATED
IN THE CELL."

 

  THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE. BORANOVA, CLEARLY ASTONISHED, SAID,
"ARE YOU GETTING SOMETHING?"

 

  "OF COURSE. IN THAT DIRECTION," SAID KONEV, POINTING.

 

  "YOU CAN TELL THE DIRECTION?" SAID BORANOVA. "HOW?"

 

  "I'M NOT SURE HOW. I JUST FEEL. IT'S IN THAT DIRECTION!"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ARKADY, DO AS YOU WERE PLANNING."

 

  "I AM DOING IT REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU SAY, NATASHA. YOU MAY BE
CAPTAIN, BUT I AM NAVIGATOR WITH DEATH STARING ME IN THE FACE. WHAT HAVE
I TO LOSE? AS MY OLD FATHER WOULD SAY: 'IF YOU ARE DANGLING FROM A ROPE
OVER AN ABYSS, DON'T BOTHER SNATCHING AT A COIN THAT FALLS OUT OF YOUR
POCKET.' -- IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I HAD A REAL STEERING MECHANISM THAN
THIS SYSTEM OF TRYING TO MANEUVER THREE OFF-CENTER ENGINES."

 

  BORANOVA HAD STOPPED LISTENING. SHE PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS USELESSLY
AND SAID, "WHAT IS IT YOU HEAR, YURI? SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS TELL US --
WHAT?"

 

  "NOTHING AT THE MOMENT. IT IS JUST NOISE. ANGUISH."

 

  KALIININ MUTTERED, AS THOUGH TO HERSELF, "DO YOU SUPPOSE PART OF
SHAPIROV'S MIND KNOWS HE'S IN A COMA? DO YOU SUPPOSE PART OF HIS MIND
FEELS TRAPPED AND IS CLAMORING TO GET OUT? LIKE ALBERT -- TRAPPED? LIKE
WE OURSELVES -- TRAPPED?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID SHARPLY, "WE ARE NOT TRAPPED, SOPHIA. WE CAN MOVE. WE
WILL FIND ALBERT. WE WILL GET OUT OF THIS BODY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
SOPHIA?" SHE REACHED FOR THE OTHER WOMAN'S SHOULDERS, HER FINGERS
DIGGING DEEPLY.

 

  KALIININ WINCED. "PLEASE. I UNDERSTAND."

 

  BORANOVA TURNED TO KONEV. "IS THAT ALL YOU GET? ANGUISH?"

 

  "BUT STRONGLY." THEN, CURIOUSLY, STARING AT BORANOVA, "DO YOU SENSE
NOTHING?"

 

  "NOTHING AT ALL."

 

  "BUT IT IS SO STRONG. STRONGER THAN ANYTHING I FELT WHEN ALBERT WAS IN
THE SHIP. IT WAS RIGHT FOR HIM TO MOVE OUTSIDE."

 

  "BUT CAN'T YOU MAKE OUT ANY ACTUAL THOUGHTS? WORDS?"

 

  "PERHAPS I AM TOO FAR. PERHAPS ALBERT HASN'T GOT HIS MACHINE PROPERLY
FOCUSED. AND YOU REALLY SENSE NOTHING?"

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD DECISIVELY AND GLANCED BRIEFLY AT KALIMIN, WHO
SAID IN A LOW VOICE (RUBBING ONE SHOULDER), "I SENSE NOTHING, EITHER."

 

  AND FROM DEZHNEV CAME A DISCONTENTED, "I NEVER GET ANY OF THESE
MYSTERIOUS MESSAGES."

 

  "YOU GOT 'HAWKING.' ALBERT SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BRAIN
TYPES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPES AND THAT HE AND I MIGHT BE OF
THE SAME TYPE. HE MAY BE RIGHT," SAID KONEV.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "FROM WHAT DIRECTION DOES THE SENSATION COME NOW?"

 

  "FROM THERE." THIS TIME KONEV POINTED MUCH CLOSER TO THE FORE END OF
THE SHIP. HE SAID, "YOU ARE TURNING, ARENT YOU, ARKADY?"

 

  "I AM," SAID DEZHNEV, "AND I'M NOW FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE DOLDRUMS
BETWEEN THE TWO STREAMS. I AM PLANNING TO EDGE ONLY SLIGHTLY INTO THE
COUNTERSTREAM SO THAT WE HEAD BACK, BUT NOT TOO QUICKLY."

 

  "GOOD," SAID BORANOVA. "WE DON'T WANT TO MISS HIM. -- YURI, CAN YOU
JUDGE THE INTENSITY? IS IT GETTING STRONGER?"

 

  "YES, IT IS." KONEV SEEMED A BIT SURPRISED, AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT
NOTICED THE RISE IN INTENSITY UNTIL BORANOVA HAD MENTIONED IT.

 

  "IS IT IMAGINATION, DO YOU THINK?"

 

  "IT MIGHT BE," SAID KONEV. "WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN ANY CLOSER TO
HIM. WE'RE JUST MAKING A TURN. IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE'S APPROACHING US."

 

  "PERHAPS HE'S WASHED OFF WHATEVER HE ADHERED TO OR FORCED HIMSELF
LOOSE. IN THAT CASE, THE CURRENT WOULD CARRY HIM TO US, IF WE'RE FORCING
A TURN AND STAYING ESSENTIALLY IN THE SAME PLACE."

 

  "PERHAPS."

 

  "YURI," SAID BORANOVA VEHEMENTLY, "YOU JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE
SENSATION. KEEP ARKADY AWARE AT ALL TIMES OF THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT
COMES, WHICH MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TO BE POINTING TOWARD ALBERT STEADILY.
-- ARKADY, AS YOU GET CLOSER TO ALBERT, YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN TOWARD THE
ORIGINAL STREAM AGAIN AND GET INTO IT AS CLOSE TO HIS POSITION AS
POSSIBLE. THEN ONCE WE'RE MOVING TOGETHER, IT WILL BE EASY TO DRIFT
CLOSER BY USE OF OUR MOTORS."

 

  "EASY FOR ONE WHO'S NOT CONTROLLING THE MOTORS," GROWLED DEZHNEV.

 

  "EASY OR DIFFICULT," SAID BORANOVA, HER FORMIDABLE EYEBROWS HUNCHING
LOW, "DO IT. IF NOT -- NO, THERE IS NO 'IF NOT.' DO IT."

 

  DEZHNEV'S LIPS MOVED, BUT NO SOUND CAME AND SILENCE FELL UPON THE SHIP
-- EXCEPT FOR THE UNHEARD FLOOD OF SENSATION THAT ENTERED KONEV'S MIND
BUT LEFT THE OTHER MINDS EMPTY.

 

  KONEV REMAINED STANDING, FACING IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT SEEMED
TO HIM THE SENSATION WAS COMING. HE MUTTERED ONCE, "DEFINITELY
STRONGER." THEN, AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS, "IT SEEMS TO ME I CAN ALMOST
SENSE WORDS. MAYBE, IF HE COMES CLOSE ENOUGH --"

 

  HIS EXPRESSION GREW EVEN MORE STRAINED, AS THOUGH IT WERE TRYING TO
FORCE THE SENSATION, TO CRAM IT INTO HIS MIND, WHILE TAKING THE NOISE
APART AND SEPARATING IT INTO WORDS. HIS FINGER KEPT POINTING RIGIDLY AND
HE SAID FINALLY, "ARKADY, BEGIN CURVING BACK INTO THE DOLDRUMS AND BE
READY TO PLUNGE INTO THE ORIGINAL STREAM. -- QUICKLY. DON'T LET HIM PASS
US."

 

  "AS QUICKLY AS THE MOTORS WILL LET ME," SAID DEZHNEV. THEN, IN A LOWER
VOICE, "IF I COULD MANEUVER THIS SHIP BY THE SAME MAGIC WITH WHICH THE
REST OF YOU HEAR VOICES --"

 

  "HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THE MEMBRANE," SAID KONEV, IGNORING THE REMARK.

 

  IT WAS KALIININ WHO SAW THE SPARK OF LIGHT FIRST. "THERE HE IS!" SHE
CRIED OUT. "THAT'S THE LIGHT OF HIS SUIT."

 

  "I DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT," SAID KONEV TO BORANOVA. "THE NOISE IS LIKE A
VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN KAMCHATKA."

 

  "STILL NOISE, YURI? NO WORDS?"

 

  "FRIGHT," SAID KONEV, "INCOHERENT FRIGHT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IF I WERE AWARE IN ANY WAY OF BEING TRAPPED IN A
COMATOSE BODY, IT WOULD BE PRECISELY HOW I WOULD FEEL. -- BUT HOW HAS HE
COME TO REALIZE IT NOW? EARLIER WE DID MAKE OUT WORDS AND EVEN QUIET AND
PEACEFUL IMAGES."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, PANTING A LITTLE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CHASE, WHICH
HAD HIM UNCONSCIOUSLY HOLDING HIS BREATH, "IT MAY BE SOMETHING WE'VE
DONE WITH THIS SHIP. WE'VE STIRRED UP HIS BRAIN."

 

  "WE'RE TOO SMALL," SAID KONEV WITH CONTEMPT. "WE CAN'T EVEN STIR UP
THIS ONE CELL NOTICEABLY."

 

  "WE'RE COMING UP TO ALBERT," SAID DEZHNEV.

 

  "SOPHIA," SAID BORANOVA, "CAN YOU DETECT HIS ELECTRICAL PATTERN?"

 

  "FAINTLY, NATALYA."

 

  "WELL, THROW EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT INTO SOMETHING COMPLEMENTARY THAT
WILL ATTRACT HIM TIGHTLY."

 

  "HE SEEMS A LITTLE LARGE. NATALVA."

 

  "HE'S OSCILLATING, I'M SURE," SAID BORANOVA GRIMLY. "ONCE YOU ATTACH
HIM TO THE SHIP, HE'LL BECOME PART OF OUR GENERAL MINIATURIZATION FIELD
AND HIS SIZE WILL ADJUST. QUICKLY, SOPHIA."

 

  THERE WAS A SLIGHT BUMP AS MORRISON WAS ELECTRONICALLY PULLED AGAINST
THE SIDE OF THE SHIP.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 16 -- DEATH

 

  ONCE THE SUN SETS, IT GROWS DARK; DON'T LET THAT CATCH YOU BY
SURPRISE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  70.

 

  MORRISON COULD NOT LATER RECALL ANYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE -- EITHER
JUST BEFORE OR JUST AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE SHIP. TRY AS HE MIGHT, HE
DID NOT REMEMBER SEEING THE SHIP COMING FOR HIM AT ANY TIME, NOR DID HE
RECALL THE MOMENT OF TRANSFER, NOR THE REMOVAL OF HIS PLASTIC SUIT.

 

  GOING FAR ENOUGH BACK, HE REMEMBERED THE DESPAIR AND LONELINESS OF
WAITING TO EXPLODE AND DIE. GOING FAR ENOUGH FORWARD, HE REMEMBERED
LOOKING UP AT THE CONCERNED FACE OF SOPHIA KALIININ BENDING OVER HIM.
THERE WAS NOTHING IN BETWEEN.

 

  HADN'T THIS HAPPENED ALREADY? THE TWO INCIDENTS, JOINED BY KALIININ'S
CARE FOR HIM, WERE SEPARATED BY SEVERAL HOURS IN TIME, BUT MELTED INTO
ONE.

 

  HE SAID IN A HOARSE AND ALMOST UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE, "ARE WE HEADED IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION?" HE SAID IT IN ENGLISH.

 

  KALIININ HESITATED, THEN ANSWERED SLOWLY, ALSO IN ENGLISH AND WITH A
MODERATELY HEAVY ACCENT, "YES, ALBERT, BUT THAT WAS SOME TIME AGO, WHEN
WE WERE IN THE CAPILLARY. YOU CAME BACK AND THEN WENT OUT A SECOND TIME.
WE ARE IN A NEURON NOW. REMEMBER?"

 

  MORRISON FROWNED. WHAT WAS ALL THIS?

 

  SLOWLY, IN BITS, HIS MEMORY RETURNED. HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED TO
GET IT ALL STRAIGHT. THEN HE SAID, "HOW DID YOU FIND  ME?" HE SPOKE IN
RUSSIAN NOW.

 

  KONEV SAID, "I SENSED -- QUITE STRONGLY -- THE THOUGHT WAVES OF
SHAPIROV AS IT CAME THROUGH YOUR INSTRUMENT."

 

  "MY COMPUTER! IS IT SAFE?"

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT WAS STILL ATTACHED TO YOU. DID YOU MAKE OUT ACTUAL
THOUGHTS?"

 

  "ACTUAL THOUGHTS?" MORRISON STARED AT HIM FUZZILY. "WHAT ACTUAL
THOUGHTS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"

 

  KONEV WAS CLEARLY IMPATIENT, BUT HE SET HIS LIPS TIGHTLY TOGETHER AND
THEN SAID, "I COULD MAKE OUT SHAPIROV'S THOUGHT WAVES REACHING ME ACROSS
THE CELL BY WAY OF YOUR DEVICE, BUT THERE WERE NO ACTUAL WORDS OR
IMAGES."

 

  "WHAT DID YOU SENSE, THEN?"

 

  "ANGUISH."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "THE REST OF US SENSED NOTHING AT ALL, BUT IT SEEMED TO
US THAT WHAT YURI DESCRIBED WAS THE ANGUISH OF A MIND THAT KNEW IT WAS
IN A COMATOSE TRAP, THAT KNEW IT WAS A PRISONER. DID YOU SENSE ANYTHING
MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT?"

 

  "NO." MORRISON LOOKED DOWN UPON HIMSELF AND REALIZED THAT HE WAS
SPRAWLED ACROSS TWO SEATS, HIS HEAD WAS IN THE CROOK OF KALIININ'S ARMS,
AND THAT HE WAS IN HIS ONE-PIECE COTTON SUIT. HE TRIED TO STRUGGLE
UPRIGHT. "WATER, PLEASE."

 

  HE DRANK THIRSTILY, THEN SAID, "I DON'T RECALL HEARING ANYTHING OR
SENSING ANYTHING. IN MY POSITION --"

 

  KONEV SAID SHARPLY, "WHAT HAS YOUR POSITION TO DO WITH IT? YOUR
COMPUTER WAS TRANSMITTING INFORMATION. I SENSED IT AT A CONSIDERABLE
DISTANCE. HOW WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU NOT TO SENSE ANYTHING?"

 

  "I HAD OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, YURI. I WAS LOST AND I WAS SURE OF
DEATH. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ELSE."

 

  "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, ALBERT. DON'T LIE TO ME."

 

  "I AM NOT LYING TO YOU. -- MADAME BORANOVA." HE MANAGED TO PRONOUNCE
THE NAME VERY FORMALLY. "I DEMAND THAT I BE TREATED IN A COURTEOUS
MANNER."

 

  "YURI," SAID BORANOVA SHARPLY. "DON'T MAKE ACCUSATIONS. IF YOU HAVE
QUESTIONS TO ASK, ASK THEM."

 

  KONEV SAID, "THEN LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. I SENSED A GREAT DEAL OF
EMOTION, EVEN THOUGH I WAS FAR FROM THE INSTRUMENT IN TERMS OF OUR
MINIATURIZED STATE. YOU, ALBERT, WERE RIGHT ON TOP OF YOUR DEVICE AND IT
WAS KEYED TO YOUR BRAIN, NOT MINE. OUR BRAINS ARE OF SIMILAR TYPE,
PRESUMABLY, BUT THEY ARE NOT IDENTICAL AND YOU CAN SENSE ON YOUR
INSTRUMENT MORE SHARPLY THAN I CAN. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE, THEN, THAT I
COULD SENSE SO MUCH AND THAT YOU SHOULD NEVERTHELESS CLAIM TO HAVE
SENSED NOTHING?"

 

  MORRISON SAID STRENUOUSLY, "DO YOU THINK I HAD TIME OR INCLINATION FOR
SENSING? I WAS SWEPT AWAY FROM THE SHIP. I WAS SEPARATED, ALONE, LOST."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT YOU NEED MAKE NO SPECIAL EFFORT TO SENSE. THE
SENSATIONS WOULD INVADE YOUR MIND DESPITE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE TAKING
PLACE."

 

  "I RECEIVED NO SENSATIONS JUST THE SAME. WHAT FILLED MY MIND WAS THAT
I WAS ALONE AND I WAS GOING TO DIE. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT? I THOUGHT I WOULD HEAT UP AND DIE, AS I ALMOST DID THE
FIRST TIME." A SUDDEN DOUBT ASSAILED HIM AND HE LOOKED ACROSS AT
KALIININ. "THERE WERE TWO TIMES, WEREN'T THERE?"

 

  "YES, ALBERT," SHE SAID SOFTLY.

 

  "AND THEN I REALIZED I WASN'T HEATING UP. INSTEAD, IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT I WAS GROWING LARGER AND SMALLER -- OSCILLATING. I WAS INVOLVED IN
SOME SORT OF MINIATURIZATION TRANSFER IN PLACE OF HEAT TRANSFER. IS THAT
POSSIBLE, NATALYA?"

 

  BORANOVA HESITATED, THEN SAID, "THAT EFFECT FOLLOWS NATURALLY FROM THE
FIELD EQUATIONS OF MINIATURIZATION. IT HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED, BUT
APPARENTLY YOU CONFIRMED IT WHILE OUT THERE."

 

  "IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MY SURROUNDINGS WERE OSCILLATING IN SIZE, THAT
THE WATER MOLECULES ALL AROUND ME WERE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING, AND IT
SEEMED TO ME TO BE MORE LOGICAL THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS OSCILLATING,
RATHER THAN THAT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS."

 

  "YOU WERE CORRECT AND WHAT YOU REPORT IS VALUABLE. ONE MIGHT ARGUE
FROM THIS THAT THE TURMOIL OF THE EVENT TO YOU WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS
COMPENSATION IN A LARGER SENSE."

 

  KONEV SAID INDIGNANTLY, "ALBERT, YOU TELL US THAT YOU WERE PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF CAREFUL AND RATIONAL THOUGHT OUT THERE -- AND YET YOU EXPECT
US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU SENSED NOTHING?"

 

  MORRISON RAISED HIS VOICE, "CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU MONOMANIAC, THAT
IT WAS THIS VERY CAREFUL AND RATIONAL THOUGHT, AS YOU CALL IT, THAT
FILLED MY MIND TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE? I WAS IN ABSOLUTE
TERROR. I EXPECTED, WITH EACH CONTRACTION OF THE MOLECULES AROUND ME,
THAT CONTRACTION WOULD CONTINUE INDEFINITELY, WHICH WOULD MEAN, IN
ACTUAL FACT, THAT I WOULD EXPAND INDEFINITELY; THAT, IN OTHER WORDS, I
WOULD UNDERGO SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION AND EXPLODE AND DIE. I WAS
NOT IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH SENSING THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT MOMENT. IF
ANY HAD FORCED THEMSELVES ON ME, I WOULD, IN MY CONDITION THEN, HAVE
IGNORED THEM. THAT IS THE TRUTH."

 

  KONEV TWISTED HIS FACE INTO AN EXPRESSION OF SCORN. "IF I HAD AN
IMPORTANT JOB TO DO AND IF A FIRING SQUAD HAD THEIR WEAPONS TRAINED ON
ME, THEN IN THE FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THEY FIRED, I WOULD STILL CONCENTRATE
ON MY JOB."

 

  DEZHNEV MUTTERED, "AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'ANYONE CAN HUNT A BEAR
FEARLESSLY WHEN THE BEAR IS ABSENT.'"

 

  KONEV TURNED ON HIM FIERCELY, "I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR FATHER, YOU OLD
DRUNKARD."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "REPEAT THAT TO ME WHEN WE ARE SAFELY BACK IN THE GROTTO
AND YOU WILL THEN FIND YOU ARE HUNTING THE BEAR WHEN THE BEAR IS
PRESENT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "NOT ANOTHER WORD, YURI. ARE YOU INTENT ON QUARRELING
WITH EVERYONE?"

 

  "NATALYA, I'M INTENT ON DOING MY JOB. ALBERT MUST GO OUT AGAIN."

 

  "NO," SAID MORRISON IN TERROR. "NEVER."

 

  DEZHNEV, WHO GLARED AT KONEV LESS THAN LOVINGLY, SAID, "A HERO OF THE
SOVIET UNION IS HEARD FROM. HE MUST DO HIS JOB, SO ALBERT MUST GO OUT
INTO THE CELL AGAIN."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DEZHNEV IS RIGHT, YURI. YOU BOAST THAT EVEN A FIRING
SQUAD WOULD NOT INTERRUPT YOUR DUTY. GO OUT ONCE, THEN, AS ALBERT HAS
DONE TWICE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT IS HIS MACHINE. IT IS KEYED TO HIS BRAIN."

 

  "SO I UNDERSTAND," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT YOU, AS YOU YOURSELF SAY, HAVE
THE SAME BRAIN TYPE. AT LEAST YOU COULD SENSE WHAT HE SENSED. CERTAINLY
YOU SENSED THE SKEPTIC WAVES WHEN HE WAS LOST IN THE INTERCELLULAR
CURRENT. AND YOU WERE AT A DISTANCE. WITH THE MACHINE IN YOUR VERY HAND
AND YOURSELF OUTSIDE, YOU WOULD GATHER DATA OF YOUR OWN, WHICH SHOULD BE
MORE VALUABLE TO US, IN ANY CASE. OF WHAT USE WOULD IT BE TO HAVE
ALBERT'S KEENER PERCEPTION IF YOU INSIST ON DISBELIEVING WHATEVER HE
SAYS?"

 

  ALL WERE STARING AT KONEV NOW. EVEN KALIININ MANAGED TO LOOK AT HIM AT
INTERVALS THROUGH HER LONG LASHES.

 

  THEN MORRISON COUGHED SLIGHTLY AND SAID, "I'M AFRAID I URINATED INTO
THE SUIT. A LITTLE. NOT MUCH, I THINK. TERROR HAS ITS PRICE."

 

  "I KNOW," SAID BORANOVA. "I'VE DRAINED IT AND CLEANED IT AS WELL AS I
COULD. THAT SHOULDN'T STOP YURI. A LITTLE BIT OF URINE RESIDUE WILL
SURELY NOT STOP THE DEDICATION TO DUTY OF A MAN LIKE HIM."

 

  KONEV SAID, "I RESENT THIS CLUMSY SARCASM ON THE PART OF ALL OF YOU,
BUT I'LL GO OUT INTO THE CELL. DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M AFRAID OF DOING
THAT? MY ONLY THOUGHT TO THE CONTRARY HAS BEEN THAT ALBERT IS THE BEST
RECEIVER. STILL, I AM SECOND-BEST, CERTAINLY, AND IF HE WILL NOT DO IT,
THEN I WILL, PROVIDED --"

 

  HE PAUSED AND DEZHNEV SAID, "PROVIDED THE BEAR IS NOT THERE, EH, YURI,
MY HERO."

 

  KONEV SAID BITTERLY, "NO, OLD SOT, PROVIDED THAT I AM HELD FIRMLY TO
THE SHIP. ALBERT WAS TORN LOOSE BECAUSE HE WAS ATTACHED FEEBLY, A POOR
JOB ON THE PART OF THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THAT DEPARTMENT. I WANT NO POOR
JOBS DONE ON ME."

 

  KALIININ SAID TO NO ONE, HER EYES ON HER FINGERTIPS, "ALBERT MUST HAVE
STRUCK A STRUCTURE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO EXACTLY FIT IT, ELECTRICALLY
SPEAKING. THE CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING WAS VERY LOW. EVEN SO, I SHALL
TRY TO MAKE USE OF AN ODD PATTERN ON THE SHIP AND THE SUIT IN ORDER TO
REDUCE THE ODDS AS FAR AS I CAN MANAGE."

 

  KONEV NODDED. "I'LL ACCEPT THAT," HE SAID TO BORANOVA. THEN, TO
MORRISON, "YOU SAY THERE IS NO HEAT TRANSFER?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "NONE THAT I COULD DETECT. JUST SIZE OSCILLATION."

 

  "THEN I WON'T BOTHER REMOVING MY GARMENT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU UNDERSTAND, YURI, THAT YOU WON'T STAY OUT LONG. WE
CANNOT STRETCH THE RISK OF DEMINIATURIZATION INDEFINITELY."

 

  "I UNDERSTAND," SAID KONEV AND WITH MORRISON'S HELP HE CLAMBERED INTO
THE SUIT.

 

  71.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED THROUGH THE HULL OF THE SHIP AND WATCHED KONEV.

 

  TWICE IT HAD BEEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND. HE HAD BEEN OUTSIDE LOOKING
IN. (AND FOR A WHILE, THAT SECOND TIME, HE HAD BEEN NOWHERE LOOKING
NOWHERE.)

 

  MORRISON FELT A LITTLE CHAGRINED THAT KONEV SEEMED SO COMPOSED. KONEV
DID NOT TURN TO LOOK INTO THE SHIP. HE HELD MORRISON'S COMPUTER IN HIS
HANDS, FOLLOWING MORRISON'S HASTY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE ELEMENTARY ASPECTS
OF EXPANDING AND FOCUSING. HE SEEMED ENTIRELY INTENT ON HIS JOB. WAS HE
REALLY THAT ICILY BRAVE? WOULD HE CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE EVEN IF HE
WERE RIPPED LOOSE AS MORRISON HAD BEEN? PROBABLY -- AND MORRISON FELT
ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.

 

  HE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS ON THE SHIP.

 

  DEZHNEV REMAINED AT HIS CONTROLS. HE HAD TO STAY NEAR THE MEMBRANE OF
THE CELL. HE HAD SUGGESTED MOVING INTO THE DOLDRUMS BETWEEN THE TWO
STREAMS. NEARLY MOTIONLESS AS THEY WOULD THEN BE (PROBABLY TURNING IN A
SLOW EDDY, ACTUALLY), THEY WOULD NOT RISK THE KIND OF ACCIDENT THAT HAD
TORN MORRISON LOOSE. KONEV HAD VETOED THAT AT ONCE. IT WAS ALONG THE
MEMBRANE THAT THE SKEPTIC WAVES MOVED AND HE WANTED TO BE NEAR THEM.

 

  DEZHNEV HAD ALSO SUGGESTED TURNING THE SHIP UPSIDE DOWN. UP AND DOWN
MADE NO DIFFERENCE HERE IN THE CELL, ANY MORE THAN IT DID IN OUTER
SPACE. BY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN, THE AIR LOCK WOULD BE ON THE SIDE OF THE
SHIP AWAY FROM THE MEMBRANE AND THAT MIGHT KEEP KONEV AWAY FROM
CYTOSKELETAL STRUCTURES.

 

  THAT MERELY ANGERED KONEV. HE POINTED OUT THAT SUCH STRUCTURES MIGHT
BE ANYWHERE IN THE CELL AND THAT, IN ANY CASE, HE DID NOT WANT THE BULK
OF THE SHIP BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE MEMBRANE.

 

  SO HE WAS OUT THERE, IN JUST THE WAY HE WANTED, AND DEZHNEV, PAYING
CLOSE ATTENTION TO HIS CONTROLS, WHISTLED VERY SOFTLY TO HIMSELF.

 

  BORANOVA WATCHED HER INSTRUMENT, LOOKING UP ONLY OCCASIONALLY TO GAZE
THOUGHTFULLY AT KONEV. KALIININ WAS FIDGETY. IT WAS THE ONLY WORD. HER
EYES SHIFTED TOWARD KONEV A HUNDRED TIMES AND THEY SHIFTED AWAY AS MANY
TIMES.

 

  BORANOVA SAID SUDDENLY, "ALBERT, IT'S YOUR INSTRUMENT. DO YOU THINK
YURI CAN WORK IT? DO YOU THINK HE'S GETTING ANYTHING?"

 

  MORRISON SMILED BRIEFLY. "I PRESET IT FOR HIM. THERE ISN'T MUCH
FURTHER FOR HIM TO DO AND I EXPLAINED THE FOCUSING. JUST THE SAME, I
KNOW HE ISN'T GETTING ANYTHING, NATALYA."

 

  "HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT?"

 

  "IF HE WERE TO SENSE SOMETHING, I WOULD OVERHEAR IT -- OR OVERSENSE
IT, PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY -- AS HE OVERSENSED ME WHEN I WAS OUT IN THE
STREAM. I SENSE NOTHING; ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED SURPRISED. "BUT COULD THAT BE? IF HE SENSED SOMETHING
WHEN YOU HELD IT, WHY SHOULDN'T HE SENSE SOMETHING WHEN HE HOLDS IT?"

 

  "PERHAPS CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED. CONSIDER THAT ALL THIS AGONY THAT
KONEV SAYS HE DETECTED WHEN HE FOLLOWED MY MACHINE'S BROADCAST OF
SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS TO ME. THAT WAS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF WHAT WE HEARD
BEFORE."

 

  "I KNOW. IT HAD BEEN ALMOST IDYLLIC BEFORE. GREEN FIELDS. MATHEMATICAL
EQUATIONS."

 

  "CAN IT BE, THEN, THAT THE LIVING PART OF SHAPIROV'S BRAIN, IF IT IS
CAPABLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, HAS JUST RECENTLY RECOGNIZED ITS COMATOSE
POSITION, THAT IT HAS DONE SO IN THE LAST HOUR, PERHAPS --"

 

  "WHY SHOULD THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST HOUR? THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A
COINCIDENCE THAT IT SHOULD DO SO NOW, JUST AS WE ARE IN THE BRAIN."

 

  "PERHAPS WE HAVE STIMULATED THE BRAIN BY ACTUALLY BEING IN IT, AND
BROUGHT THE REALIZATION ABOUT IN CONSEQUENCE. OR, PERHAPS IT IS A
COINCIDENCE. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT COINCIDENCES IS THAT THEY DO HAPPEN.
-- AND PERHAPS THE REALIZATION THAT STRUCK HIM WITH ANGUISH NOT LONG AGO
HAS NOW CAUSED HIM TO SINK INTO SILENT APATHY."

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED UNCERTAIN. "I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. DO YOU REALLY
THINK YURI'S NOT GETTING ANYTHING?"

 

  "NOTHING OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE. I AM QUITE CERTAIN."

 

  "PERHAPS I SHOULD CALL HIM IN."

 

  "I WOULD IF I WERE YOU, NATALYA. HE'S BEEN OUT NEARLY TEN MINUTES. IF
HE ISN'T GETTING ANYTHING, THAT'S TIME ENOUGH."

 

  "BUT WHAT IF HE'S GETTING SOMETHING?"

 

  "THEN HE'LL REFUSE TO COME IN. YOU KNOW KONEV."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "TAP ON THE HULL OF THE SHIP, ALBERT. YOU'RE NEAREST
HIS FACE."

 

  MORRISON DID SO AND KONEV LOOKED IN THEIR DIRECTION. HIS FACE WAS
BLURRED THROUGH THE PLASTIC HEADPIECE BUT HE WORE AN UNMISTAKABLE FROWN.
BORANOVA GESTURED FOR HIM TO COME IN.

 

  KONEV HESITATED, THEN NODDED, AND MORRISON SAID TO BORANOVA, "THERE'S
YOUR PROOF."

 

  KONEV WAS BROUGHT IN AND THEY COULD SEE HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED. THEY
UNBUCKLED HIS HELMET AND HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH.

 

  "WHEW! THAT'S GOOD. IT WAS GETTING A LITTLE WARM OUT THERE. SINCE I
WAS ATTACHED TO THE SHIP, THE SIZE OSCILLATION WAS LESS THAN I EXPECTED
AND THE HEAT TRANSFER WAS PERCEPTIBLE. -- HELP ME GET THE REST OF THIS
PLASTIC ARMOR OFF."

 

  BORANOVA SAID IN A SUDDEN SMALL SPASM OF HOPE, "IS THAT WHY YOU WERE
READY TO COME IN? THE HEAT?"

 

  "THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CHIEF REASON."

 

  "DID YOU SENSE ANYTHING, YURI?"

 

  AND KONEV SCOWLED AND SAID, "NO. NOT A THING. NOTHING."

 

  MORRISON LIFTED HIS HEAD. A MUSCLE IN HIS RIGHT CHEEK TWITCHED
BRIEFLY, BUT HE DID NOT SMILE.

 

  72.

 

  "WELL, NATASHA, LITTLE CAPTAIN," SAID DEZHNEV WITH AN AIR OF FADED
BONHOMIE. "WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? ANY IDEAS?"

 

  HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER, IN FACT, NO ONE SEEMED TO NOTICE THAT HE HAD
SPOKEN.

 

  KONEV WAS STILL MOPPING AWAY AT HIS CHEST AND AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK.
HIS LOOK AT MORRISON HAD NO BONHOMIE IN IT AT ALL. HIS DARK EYES
SMOLDERED. "THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF TRANSMISSION OUT THERE WHEN YOU
WERE OUTSIDE THE SHIP."

 

  "IF YOU SAY SO," SAID MORRISON COLDLY, "BUT I TOLD YOU THAT I DON'T
REMEMBER A THING ABOUT IT."

 

  "MAYBE IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHO HOLDS THE DEVICE."

 

  "I DON'T BELIEVE THAT."

 

  "SCIENCE IS NOT A MATTER OF BELIEF, BUT OF EVIDENCE. WHY DON'T WE SEE
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO OUT HOLDING YOUR OWN DEVICE EXACTLY AS I DID?
WE'LL HAVE YOU BOUND FIRMLY SO THAT YOU DON'T COME LOOSE AGAIN AND YOU
CAN STAY OUT THE SAME TEN MINUTES I DID. NO MORE."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I WON'T DO IT. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED."

 

  "AND I SENSED SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS -- EVEN IF YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T."

 

  "YOU DID NOT SENSE HIS THOUGHTS. YOU SENSED ONLY EMOTION. THERE WERE
NO WORDS."

 

  "BECAUSE YOU LET GO OF THE DEVICE. YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELF. TRY IT
NOW, WITHOUT LETTING GO."

 

  "NO. IT WON'T WORK."

 

  "YOU WERE FRIGHTENED BECAUSE YOU WERE TORN LOOSE. THIS TIME YOU WILL
NOT BE TORN LOOSE, AS I WAS NOT. YOU WILL NOT BE FRIGHTENED."

 

  "YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY CAPACITY FOR TERROR, YURI," SAID MORRISON,
SHRUGGING.

 

  KONEV LOOKED DISGUSTED. "IS THIS A TIME TO JOKE?"

 

  "I'M NOT JOKING. I'M EASILY TERRIFIED. I LACK YOUR -- WHATEVER.

 

  "COURAGE?"

 

  "ALL RIGHT. IF YOU WANT AN ADMISSION I LACK COURAGE, I'LL ADMIT IT."

 

  KONEV TURNED TO LOOK AT BORANOVA. "NATALYA. YOU ARE THE CAPTAIN.
DIRECT ALBERT TO TRY ONCE MORE."

 

  "I DON'T THINK I CAN DIRECT HIM UNDER THESE CONDITIONS," SAID
BORANOVA. "AS HE HIMSELF HAS SAID, WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO IF WE COMBINE
OUR STRENGTH, FORCE HIM INTO THE SUIT, AND SHOVE HIM OUT? IF HE IS
INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, WE'LL GET NOTHING OUT OF IT. HOWEVER, I CAN
ASK HIM. -- ALBERT."

 

  "SAVE YOUR BREATH," SAID MORRISON WEARILY.

 

  "ONCE MORE. NOT MORE THAN THREE MINUTES BY THE CLOCK UNLESS YOU GET A
TRANSMISSION."

 

  "WE WON'T. I'M CONVINCED WE WON'T."

 

  "THEN ONLY THREE MINUTES TO PROVE THE POINT."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "TO WHAT END, NATALYA? IF I GET NOTHING, YURI WILL SAY
I AM DELIBERATELY MISADJUSTING MY COMPUTER. IF THERE IS NO TRUST BETWEEN
US, WE WILL ACCOMPLISH NOTHING IN ANY CASE. HOW WOULD IT BE, FOR
INSTANCE, IF I DISPLAYED KONEV'S CONVICTION THAT TO DISAGREE IS TO LIE?
I SAY I SENSED NOTHING OF EITHER SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS OR EMOTIONS WHEN I
WAS ALONE IN THE INTRACELLULAR STREAM. KONEV SAID HE SENSED A GREAT
DEAL. WHO ELSE DID? DID YOU, NATALYA?"

 

  "NO. I SENSED NOTHING."

 

  "SOPHIA?"

 

  KAFFININ SHOOK HER HEAD.

 

  "ARKADY?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID IN AN AGGRIEVED TONE, "I DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SENSE
VERY MUCH."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WELL, THEN, YURI STANDS ALONE. HOW ARE WE TO KNOW HE
REALLY SENSED ANYTHING? I SHALL NOT BE AS UNKIND AS HE IS. I SHALL NOT
ACCUSE HIM OF LYING -- BUT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT HIS WILD DESIRE TO
SENSE SOMETHING CAUSED HIM TO IMAGINE HE HAD?"

 

  KONEV'S FACE WAS WHITE WITH ANGER, BUT HIS VOICE, EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT
TREMOR, WAS COOL ENOUGH. "FORGET ALL THAT. WE HAVE SPENT HOURS IN THIS
BODY AND I'M ASKING FOR ONE LAST OBSERVATION, ONE LAST EXPERIMENT, THAT
MAY JUSTIFY ALL THAT HAS GONE BEFORE."

 

  "NO," SAID MORRISON. "LAST PAYS ALL. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT, THIS TIME THERE WILL BE NO MISTAKE. ONE LAST
EXPERIMENT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A LAST EXPERIMENT. OUR POWER SUPPLY
IS LOWER THAN I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. FINDING YOU WAS COSTLY, ALBERT."

 

  "YET WE DID FIND YOU," SAID KONEV, "AND WITHOUT COUNTING THE COST. I
FOUND YOU." HE SUDDENLY SMILED TIGHTLY AND FIERCELY. "AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE FOUND YOU IF I DID NOT DETECT THE TRANSMISSIONS EMANATING FROM YOUR
DEVICE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE. THERE'S THE PROOF THAT WHAT I
SENSED WAS NOT IMAGINARY. AND SINCE I FOUND YOU, PAY ME BACK."

 

  MORRISON'S NOSTRILS FLARED. "YOU CAME AFTER ME BECAUSE MY EXPLOSION
WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ALL IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, PERHAPS. WHAT PAYMENT
DO YOU EXPECT FOR YOUR ANXIETY TO SAVE YOUR OWN LI-"

 

  THE SHIP ROCKED VIOLENTLY WITHOUT WARNING. IT SWAYED HEAVILY AND
KONEV, WHO HAD BEEN STANDING, TOTTERED AND CAUGHT AT THE BACK OF HIS
SEAT.

 

  "WHAT WAS IT?" CALLED OUT BORANOVA, CLUTCHING WITH ONE HAND AT HER OWN
CONTROL DEVICE.

 

  KALIININ BENT OVER HER COMPUTER. "I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE, BUT YOU CAN'T
TELL IN THIS LIGHT. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A RIBOSOME."

 

  "A RIBOSOME," REPEATED MORRISON IN ASTONISHMENT.

 

  "WHY NOT? THEY'RE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE CELL. THEY'RE THE
PROTEIN-MANUFACTURING ORGANELLES."

 

  "I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE," SAID MORRISON INDIGNANTLY.

 

  "SO IT LANDED US A BLOW. OR RATHER, AS WE SKIMMED ALONG, WE LANDED IT
A BLOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY YOU LOOK AT IT; WE JUST HAD A GIANT
PIECE OF BROWNIAN MOTION."

 

  "WORSE THAN THAT," SAID DEZHNEV, POINTING OUTWARD IN HORROR. "WE'RE
NOT GETTING HEAT TRANSFER, WE'RE GETTING FIELD OSCILLATION."

 

  MORRISON, STARING IN DESPAIR, RECOGNIZED THE PHENOMENON HE HAD SEEN
WHEN ALONE IN THE CELL. THE WATER MOLECULES WERE EXPANDING AND
CONTRACTING -- VISIBLY SO.

 

  "STOP IT! STOP IT!" SHOUTED KONEV.

 

  "I'M TRYING TO," SAID BORANOVA THROUGH TIGHT LIPS. "ARKADY, SHUT OFF
THE JETS AND MAKE ALL THE POWER AVAILABLE TO ME. -- SHUT OFF THE
AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTS, EVERYTHING!"

 

  BORANOVA BENT OVER THE TINY GLOW THAT MARKED HER BATTERY-POWERED
COMPUTER.

 

  MORRISON COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT FOR THE LIGHT FROM BORANOVA'S
COMPUTER AND, IN THE SEAT NEXT TO HIM, KALIININ'S. HE COULD NOT SEE, IN
THE OTHERWISE TOTAL DARKNESS OF A CELL BURIED IN THE INTERIOR OF A
BRAIN, THE WATER MOLECULES SWELLING AND SUBSIDING.

 

  THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IT, HOWEVER. HE COULD FEEL THE JARRING
IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH. IT WAS NOT THE WATER MOLECULES THAT WERE
OSCILLATING, AFTER ALL. IT WAS THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD THAT WAS -- AND
THE OBJECTS THAT WERE BURIED IN IT -- AND HE HIMSELF.

 

  EACH TIME THE SHIP EXPANDED (AND THE WATER MOLECULES SEEMED TO
CONTRACT), THE FIELD CONVERTED SOME OF ITS ENERGY TO HEAT AND HE COULD
FEEL THE FLUSH THAT SWEPT OVER HIM. THEN, AS BORANOVA FORCED ENERGY INTO
THE FIELD, SQUEEZING IT INTO CONTRACTION, THE HEAT VANISHED. FOR A
WHILE, HE COULD FEEL THE OSCILLATIONS SLOW AND SUBSIDE.

 

  BUT THEN THEY BEGAN TO GROW WILDER AND HE KNEW THAT BORANOVA WAS
FAILING. SHE COULD NOT FEND OFF THE SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION THAT
WAS ON THE WAY AND, IN TEN SECONDS, HE KNEW HE WOULD BE DEAD. HE -- AND
ALL OF THEM, AND THE BODY IN WHICH THEY WERE BURIED -- WOULD BE AN
EXPLODING PUFF OF WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE.

 

  HE FELT DIZZY. HE WAS GOING TO FAINT AND, IN HIS PUSILLANIMOUS WAY, HE
WOULD THUS ANTICIPATE DEATH BY A SECOND AND HIS LAST RECOGNIZABLE
EMOTION WOULD BE ONE OF INTENSE SHAME.

 

  73.

 

  THE SECONDS PASSED AND MORRISON DIDN'T FAINT. HE STIRRED A LITTLE. HE
SHOULD BE DEAD BY NOW, SHOULDN'T HE? (IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THE NEXT
THOUGHT SHOULD COME: CAN THERE BE AN AFTERLIFE AFTER ALL? -- HE
DISMISSED THE POSSIBILITY QUICKLY.)

 

  HE WAS AWARE OF SOMEONE SOBBING. NO! IT WAS HARSH BREATHING.

 

  HE OPENED HIS EYES (HE HADN'T REALIZED THEY WERE CLOSED) AND FOUND
HIMSELF STARING AT KALIININ IN THE DIM LIGHT. SINCE ALL THE ENERGY
AVAILABLE WAS BEING PUMPED INTO THE EFFORT TO KEEP THE SHIP FROM
DEMINIATURIZING, HE SAW HER ONLY BY THE GLOW OF HER OWN COMPUTER. HE
COULD MAKE OUT HER HEAD BENT OVER IT, HER HAIR IN DISARRAY AND HER
BREATH WHISTLING SHARPLY THROUGH HER PARTED LIPS.

 

  HE LOOKED AROUND IN A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HOPE AND THOUGHT AND LIFE. THE
SHIP'S OSCILLATIONS SEEMED LESS EXTREME. THEY WERE SETTLING DOWNWARD
INTO A KIND OF PEACE EVEN AS HE WATCHED.

 

  AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY, KALIININ STOPPED AND LOOKED UP SIDEWISE AT HIM,
HER FACE TWITCHING INTO A PAINFUL SMILE. "IT IS DONE," SHE SAID IN A
HOARSE WHISPER.

 

  THE LIGHT WITHIN THE SHIP BRIGHTENED SLOWLY, ALMOST TENTATIVELY, AND
DEZHNEV UTTERED A HUGE SHUDDERING SIGH. "IF I AM NOT DEAD NOW," HE SAID,
"I HOPE TO LIVE YET A LITTLE WHILE. AS MY FATHER ONCE SAID: 'LIFE WOULD
BE UNBEARABLE IF DEATH WERE NOT WORSE YET.' -- THANK YOU, NATASHA. YOU
MAY BE MY CAPTAIN FOREVER."

 

  "NOT I," SAID BORANOVA, HER FACE LOOKING VERY OLD -- TO THE POINT
WHERE MORRISON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE WHITE STREAKS IN HER
BLACK HAIR. "I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUMP ENOUGH ENERGY INTO THE SHIP. WAS IT
SOMETHING YOU DID, SOPHIA?"

 

  KALIININ'S EYES WERE CLOSED NOW, BUT HER BREASTS WERE STILL HEAVING.
SHE STIRRED A LITTLE, AS THOUGH RELUCTANT TO ANSWER, RELUCTANT TO DO
ANYTHING BUT SAVOR LIFE FOR A TIME. THEN SHE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHAT DID YOU DO?"

 

  KALIININ SAID, "I COULDN'T JUST WAIT FOR DEATH. I MADE THE SHIP THE
ELECTRIC DUPLICATE OF A D-GLUCOSE MOLECULE AND HOPED THE CELL WOULD DO
THE NORMAL THING AND INTERACT WITH A MOLECULE OF ATP -- ADENOSINE
TRIPHOSPHATE. IN DOING SO, IT GAINED A PHOSPHATE GROUP AND ENERGY. THE
ENERGY, I HOPED, WOULD GO INTO REINFORCING THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD. I
THEN NEUTRALIZED THE SHIP AND THE PHOSPHATE GROUP FELL OFF. D-GLUCOSE
AGAIN, ANOTHER GAIN IN ENERGY, THEN NEUTRAL, AND SO ON, OVER AND OVER."
SHE STOPPED TO PANT A BIT. "OVER AND OVER. MY FINGERS WERE WORKING SO
FAST, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WERE HITTING THE RIGHT KEYS OR NOT -- BUT I
MUST HAVE. AND THE SHIP GAINED ENOUGH ENERGY TO STABILIZE THE FIELD."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "HOW DID YOU COME TO DO THAT? NO ONE HAS EVER SUGGESTED
IN MY HEARING THAT THIS MIGHT --"

 

  "NOR IN MINE," SAID KALIININ. "NOR IN MINE. I WAS JUST WONDERING THIS
MORNING BEFORE WE GOT ON THE SHIP WHAT I WOULD DO -- OR WHAT ANYONE
COULD DO -- IF SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION BEGAN. WE'D NEED ENERGY,
BUT IF THE SHIP COULDN'T PUMP UP ENOUGH -- I THOUGHT, COULD THE CELL
ITSELF SUPPLY THE ENERGY? IF IT DID, IT WOULD ONLY BE THROUGH ATP, WHICH
EVERY CELL HAS. I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WOULD WORK. I HAD TO SPEND ENERGY,
FORCING THE ELECTRICAL PATTERN ON AND OFF THE SHIP, AND I KNEW I MIGHT
SPEND MORE THAN I GOT FROM ATP. OR THE ENERGY OF THE ATP MIGHT SIMPLY
NOT AFFECT THE SHIP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO COUNTER THE DEMINIATURIZATION.
IT WAS ALL SUCH A GAMBLE."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID -- SOFTLY, ALMOST AS THOUGH TO HIMSELF, "AS MY OLD FATHER
WOULD SAY: 'IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, GAMBLE FREELY.'" THEN, BRISKLY,
HE SAID, "THANK YOU, LITTLE SOPHIA. MY LIFE IS YOURS FROM NOW ON. I WILL
GIVE IT TO YOU AT YOUR NEED. I WILL GO FARTHER. I WILL EVEN MARRY YOU IF
THAT WOULD STRIKE YOU AS CONVENIENT."

 

  "A CHIVALROUS OFFER," SAID KALIININ, SMILING FAINTLY, "BUT I WOULDN'T
ASK MARRIAGE OF YOU. YOUR MERE LIFE -- AT NEED -- WOULD BE QUITE
ENOUGH."

 

  BORANOVA WAS ENTIRELY HERSELF NOW AND SHE SAID, "THIS WILL BE CITED IN
DETAIL IN THE FINAL REPORT. YOUR QUICK THINKING AND YOUR QUICK ACTION
SAVED EVERYTHING."

 

  MORRISON COULDN'T TRUST HIMSELF TO MAKE ANY SPEECH AT ALL.
(UNACCOUNTABLY, HE FELT NEAR TEARS. -- IN GRATITUDE FOR LIFE? IN
ADMIRATION FOR KALIININ?) ALL HE COULD DO WAS REACH FOR KALIININ'S HAND,
PUT IT TO HIS LIPS, AND KISS IT. THEN, AFTER CLEARING HIS THROAT
VIGOROUSLY, HE SAID WITH EXTRAORDINARY MILDNESS, "THANK YOU, SOPHIA."

 

  SHE LOOKED EMBARRASSED, BUT DID NOT DRAW HER HAND AWAY IMMEDIATELY.
SHE SAID, "IT MIGHT NOT HAVE WORKED. I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK."

 

  "HAD IT NOT," SAID DEZHNEV, "WE WOULD BE NO DEADER."

 

  THROUGH ALL THIS, ONLY YURI KONEV HAD NOT SAID A WORD AND MORRISON
TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM. HE SAT AS HE USUALLY SAT, VERY UPRIGHT AND VERY
MUCH TURNED AWAY FROM THEM.

 

  MORRISON, FINDING HIS VOICE SUDDENLY -- AND HIS ANGER -- SAID, "WELL,
YURI, WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY?"

 

  KONEV LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER BRIEFLY AND SAID, "NOTHING."

 

  "NOTHING? SOPHIA SAVED THE EXPEDITION."

 

  KONEV SHRUGGED, "SHE DID HER JOB."

 

  "HER JOB? SHE DID MUCH MORE THAN HER JOB." MORRISON LEANED FORWARD AND
REACHED WILDLY FOR KONEV, GRABBING HIS SHOULDER. "SHE INVENTED THE
TECHNIQUE THAT SAVED US. AND IN DOING SO, SHE SAVED YOUR LIFE, YOU
IDIOT. SHE'S THE REASON YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. YOU CAN AT LEAST THANK HER."

 

  "I'LL DO AS I PLEASE," SAID KONEV, TWITCHING HIS SHOULDER AND THEN
WRITHING OUT OF MORRISON'S GRASP.

 

  MORRISON'S HANDS FOUND THEIR WAY AROUND KONEV'S THROAT. "YOU
MISERABLE, EGOTISTICAL BARBARIAN," HE GRUNTED OUT, SQUEEZING
DESPERATELY. "YOU LOVE HER IN YOUR OWN INSANE WAY AND YOU WON'T GIVE HER
A KIND WORD. NOT ONE KIND WORD, YOU PIECE OF DIRT."

 

  AGAIN KONEV PULLED HIMSELF LOOSE AND THEN THE TWO WERE PUMMELING EACH
OTHER CLUMSILY. THEY WERE HALF-TRAPPED BY THE SEATS FROM WHICH THEY HAD
PARTLY RISEN AND NEITHER COULD MANEUVER PROPERLY UNDER ZERO-GRAVITY
CONDITIONS.

 

  KALIININ SCREAMED, "DON'T HURT HIM!"

 

  HE WON'T HURT ME, THOUGHT MORRISON, STRIVING MIGHTILY. HE HAD NOT BEEN
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF PHYSICAL COMBAT SINCE HE WAS SIXTEEN AND, HE
THOUGHT IN EMBARRASSMENT, HE WASN'T DOING ANY BETTER NOW.

 

  BORANOVA'S VOICE RANG OUT SHARPLY. "STOP IT. BOTH OF YOU."

 

  AND THEY DID. BOTH OF THEM.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT, YOU ARE NOT HERE TO TEACH ANYONE MANNERS. AND
YURI, YOU NEED NOT LABOR TO BE A BOOR, IT COMES NATURAL TO YOU. IF YOU
DO NOT WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOPHIA'S --"

 

  SOPHIA SAID WITH AN OBVIOUS EFFORT, "I'M NOT ASKING FOR THANKS -- FROM
ANYONE."

 

  "THANKS?" SAID KONEV ANGRILY. "LET US ALL SAY THANKS. BEFORE THE
DEMINIATURIZATION STARTED, I WAS TRYING TO GET THIS AMERICAN COWARD TO
THANK US FOR RESCUING HIM. I DIDN'T WANT THANKS IN WORDS. THIS ISN'T A
DANCE FLOOR. WE NEEDN'T BOW AND CURTSY. I WANTED HIM TO SHOW HIS THANKS
BY GETTING OUT THERE AND TRYING TO SENSE SOME OF SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS. HE
REFUSED. WHO IS HE TO TEACH ME HOW AND WHEN TO SAY THANKS?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I SAID BEFORE THE DEMINIATURIZATION THAT I WOULDN'T DO
IT AND I REPEAT THAT NOW."

 

  DEZHNEV INTERRUPTED AND SAID, "WE BEAT A DEAD HORSE HERE. WE HAVE
CONSUMED OUR ENERGY SUPPLY AS THOUGH IT WERE VODKA AT A WEDDING. BETWEEN
PURSUITS AND DEMINIATURIZATIONS, WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SPARE FOR THE
TASK OF DEMINIATURIZING UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. WE MUST GET OUT
NOW."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT WOULD TAKE VERY LITTLE ENERGY TO HAVE THIS MAN GO OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND COME IN AGAIN. THEN WE CAN LEAVE."

 

  FOR A MOMENT, KONEV AND MORRISON STARED AT EACH OTHER HOSTILELY AND
THEN DEZHNEV SAID IN A VOICE THAT SEEMED DRAINED OF SOME OF ITS LIFE,
"MY POOR OLD FATHER USED TO SAY: 'THE MOST FRIGHTENING PHRASE IN THE
RUSSIAN LANGUAGE IS "THAT'S ODD."'"

 

  KONEV TURNED ANGRILY AND SAID, "SHUT UP, ARKADY."

 

  DEZHNEV REPLIED, "I MENTIONED THAT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS NOW TIME FOR ME
TO SAY IT: THAT'S ODD."

 

  74.

 

  BORANOVA PUSHED HER DARK HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD (A BIT WEARILY,
MORRISON THOUGHT, AND NOTED THE HAIR ITSELF WAS CLEARLY DAMP WITH
PERSPIRATION). SHE SAID, "WHAT IS ODD, ARKADY? LET US NOT PLAY GAMES."

 

  "THE CURRENT FLOW OF THE CELLULAR MATERIAL IS SLOWING."

 

  THERE WAS A BRIEF SILENCE, THEN BORANOVA SAID, "HOW CAN YOU TELL?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID HEAVILY, "NATASHA, DEAR, IF YOU SAT IN MY SEAT YOU WOULD
KNOW THAT THERE ARE FIBERS CRISS-CROSSING THE CELL --"

 

  "THE CYTOSKELETON," PUT IN MORRISON.

 

  "THANK YOU, ALBERT, MY CHILD," SAID DEZHNEV WITH A GRAND WAVE OF HIS
HAND. "MY FATHER USED TO SAY: 'IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE THING
THAN THE NAME.' STILL, NEVER MIND. THE WHATEVER - YOU - CALL - IT
DOESN'T STOP THE CELL FLOW AND IT DOESN'T STOP THE SHIP, BUT I CAN SEE
IT GLINT PAST. WELL, IT'S GLINTING PAST MORE SLOWLY NOW. I ASSUME THE
FIBERS DON'T MOVE, SO I TAKE IT WE'RE SLOWING. AND SINCE I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO SLOW THE SHIP, I ASSUME THAT IT IS THE INTRACELLULAR FLOW
THAT IS REALLY SLOWING. -- THIS IS CALLED LOGIC, ALBERT, SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EDUCATE ME ON THAT POINT."

 

  KALIININ SAID IN A SMALL VOICE, "I THINK WE HAVE DAMAGED THE CELL."
SHE SOUNDED CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN.

 

  MORRISON TOOK IT SO AND SAID, "ONE BRAIN CELL GONE, MORE OR LESS,
WON'T HURT SHAPIROV IN ANY WAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONDITION HE'S IN. I
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THE CELL WERE GONE, THOUGH. AFTER ALL, THE SHIP
CAME AFTER ME IN A FURIOUS RACE, I IMAGINE -- AND I THANK YOU ALL AGAIN
FOR THAT -- AND IT PROBABLY VIBRATED ITSELF NEARLY TO DEATH AND MUST
HAVE VIBRATED THE ENTIRE CELL AS WELL."

 

  KONEV SAID, FROWNING DARKLY, "THAT'S MAD. WE'RE MOLECULE-SIZED -- AND
A SMALL MOLECULE AT THAT. DO YOU SUPPOSE ANYTHING WE CAN DO, WHETHER
MOVING OR JIGGLING, IS GOING TO DAMAGE AN ENTIRE CELL?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WE DON'T HAVE TO REASON IT OUT, YURI. IT'S AN OBSERVED
FACT. THE INTRACELLULAR STREAM IS STOPPING AND THAT ISN'T NORMAL."

 

  "IN THE FIRST PLACE, THAT'S JUST ARKADY'S IMPRESSION," SAID KONEV,
"AND HE'S NO NEUROLOGIST --"

 

  "DO I HAVE TO BE A NEUROLOGIST TO HAVE EYES?" DEMANDED DEZHNEV HOTLY,
ONE ARM RAISED AS THOUGH TO STRIKE AT THE YOUNGER MAN.

 

  KONEV CAST A BRIEF GLANCE AT DEZHNEV, BUT MADE NO OTHER ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF HIS REMARK. HE SAID, "AND BESIDES, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS NORMAL IN A
LIVING BRAIN CELL FROM THIS LEVEL OF OBSERVATION. THERE MAY BE CALMS AND
EDDIES IN THE FLOW, SO THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS OBSERVED, IT
MIGHT BE ONLY TEMPORARY."

 

  "YOU'RE WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD, YURI," SAID MORRISON. "THE FACT
IS, WE CAN'T USE THIS CELL ANY MORE AND WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT
REMAINING ENERGY TO WANDER AROUND SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER CELL."

 

  KONEV GROUND HIS TEETH. "THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO. WE CAN'T
GIVE UP."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "NATALYA, MAKE THE DECISION. IS THERE ANY POINT IN
INVESTIGATING THIS CELL ANY FURTHER? AND ARE WE IN A POSITION TO SEEK
OUT ANOTHER CELL?"

 

  BORANOVA RAISED HER HAND AND BOWED HER HEAD IN A MOMENT OF THOUGHT.
THE OTHERS TURNED TO LOOK AT HER AND KONEV SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO
GRASP MORRISON BY THE UPPER ARM AND PULL HIM CLOSER. HIS EYES WERE DARK
WITH HOSTILITY. HE WHISPERED, "HOW IS IT YOU THINK I AM IN LOVE WITH --"
HE JERKED HIS HEAD IN KALIININ'S DIRECTION. "WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO
THINK SO? TELL ME THAT."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED AT HIM BLANKLY.

 

  AT THIS POINT, BORANOVA SPOKE, BUT IT WAS NOT TO ANSWER MORRISON'S
QUESTION. SHE SAID MILDLY, "ARKADY, WHAT IS IT YOU ARE DOING?"

 

  DEZHNEV, WHO WAS BENT OVER HIS CONTROLS, LIFTED HIS HEAD. "I AM
REARRANGING THE WIRING BACK TO WHAT IT WAS. I AM HOOKING UP
COMMUNICATIONS AGAIN."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "HAVE I TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?"

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "NECESSITY HAS TOLD ME TO DO THAT."

 

  KONEV SAID, "DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER?"

 

  DEZHNEV GROWLED AND SAID IN SULLEN IRONY, "AND DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU
THAT THERE MAY BE NO MORE STEERING TO DO?"

 

  "WHAT IS THE NECESSITY THAT DRIVES YOU, ARKADY?" SAID BORANOVA
PATIENTLY.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "I DON'T THINK IT'S THIS CELL ALONE THAT IS OUT OF
ORDER. THE TEMPERATURE AROUND US IS GOING DOWN. -- SLOWLY."

 

  KONEV SNEERED. "BY YOUR MEASUREMENTS?"

 

  "NO. BY THE SHIP'S MEASUREMENTS. BY THE BACKGROUND INFRARED RADIATION
WE'RE GETTING."

 

  "YOU CAN'T TELL ANYTHING BY THAT," SAID KONEV. "AT OUR SIZE, WE GET
VERY FEW INFRARED PHOTONS. THE LEVEL WOULD VARY ALL OVER THE LOT."

 

  DEZHNEV NODDED AT KONEV AND SAID, "LIKE THIS." HIS HAND WAVED UP AND
DOWN FRENETICALLY. "STILL, IT CAN WAVE UP AND DOWN LIKE A ROWBOAT IN A
TYPHOON AND YET DO SO AT A LOWER AND LOWER AVERAGE LEVEL." AND HIS HAND
SANK EVER LOWER AS IT CONTINUED ITS TREMBLING.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHY SHOULD THE TEMPERATURE BE DROPPING?"

 

  MORRISON SMILED GRIMLY. "COME ON, NATALYA. I THINK YOU KNOW WHY. I
KNOW THAT YURI KNOWS WHY. ARKADY MUST FIND OUT AND FOR THAT REASON
NECESSITY IS FORCING HIM TO PUT BACK COMMUNICATIONS."

 

  AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE FELL, EXCEPT FOR DEZHNEV'S OCCASIONAL GRUNTS
AND MUTTERED EXPLETIVES AS HE STRUGGLED WITH THE SHIP'S WIRING.

 

  MORRISON GAZED OUT AT THE SURROUNDINGS, WHICH HE COULD ONCE AGAIN SEE
IN THE USUAL UNSATISFACTORY FASHION NOW THAT SHIP'S LIGHTING HAD BEEN
RESTORED. THERE WERE THE USUAL DIM GLITTER OF MOLECULES, LARGE AND
SMALL, THAT TRAVELED WITH THEM. NOW THAT DEZHNEV HAD MENTIONED IT, HE
SAW THE OCCASIONAL REFLECTION OF LIGHT FROM A LINE THAT STRETCHED ACROSS
THE PATH BEFORE THEM AND THEN MOVED OVER (OR UNDER) AND BEHIND AT
EXPRESS SPEED.

 

  THESE WERE, UNDOUBTEDLY, VERY THIN COLLAGEN FIBERS THAT PRESERVED THE
SHAPE OF THE IRREGULAR NEURON AND KEPT IT FROM CONVERTING ITSELF INTO A
ROUGHLY SPHERICAL BLOB UNDER THE PULL OF ITS OWN SURFACE TENSION. HAD HE
BEEN WATCHING FOR IT, HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED IT BEFORE. IT OCCURRED TO
HIM THAT DEZHNEV, AS NAVIGATOR, HAD TO WATCH FOR EVERYTHING AND, IN THE
ENTIRELY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION IN WHICH THE SHIP FOUND ITSELF, DEZHNEV
HAD HAD NO GUIDE, NO INSTRUCTION, NO EXPERIENCE TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT TO
WATCH FOR. THERE WAS NO QUESTION BUT THAT DEZHNEV'S TASK HAD PLACED HIM
UNDER GREATER TENSION THAN THE OTHERS HAD ALLOWED FOR.

 

  CERTAINLY, TO MORRISON HIMSELF, DEZHNEV HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED AS
THE LEAST OF THE FIVE. NOT FAIR, MORRISON THOUGHT NOW.

 

  DEZHNEV HAD STRAIGHTENED UP NOW. HE HAD AN EARPHONE IN ONE EAR CANAL
AND SAID, "I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION." HE SAID, "ARE
YOU THERE? GROTTO. --GROTTO."

 

  THEN HE SMILED. "YES. WE ARE, TO THIS POINT, SAFE. -- I'M SORRY, BUT
AS I TOLD YOU, IT WAS EITHER COMMUNICATE OR STEER. -- HOW IS IT AT YOUR
END? -- WHAT? REPEAT THAT, MORE SLOWLY. -- YES, I THOUGHT SO."

 

  HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS. "COMRADES," HE SAID, "ACADEMICIAN PYOTR
LEONOVICH SHAPIROV IS DEAD. THIRTEEN MINUTES AGO, ALL VITAL SIGNS CEASED
AND OUR TASK NOW IS TO LEAVE THE BODY."

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 17 -- EXIT

 

  IF TROUBLE WERE AS EASY TO GET OUT OF AS INTO -- LIFE WOULD BE ONE
SWEET SONG.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  75.

 

  A GRAY SILENCE FELL OVER THE SHIP.

 

  KALIININ BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND THEN, AFTER A LONG MOMENT,
BROKE THE SILENCE BY WHISPERING, "ARE YOU SURE, ARKADY?"

 

  AND DEZHNEV, BLINKING HARD TO HOLD BACK TEARS, SAID, "AM I SURE? THE
MAN HAS BEEN ON THE BRINK OF DEATH FOR WEEKS. THE CELLULAR FLOW IS
SLOWING, THE TEMPERATURE IS FALLING, AND THE GROTTO, WHICH HAS HIM WIRED
WITH EVERY INSTRUMENT EVER INVENTED, SAYS HE IS DEAD. WHAT IS THERE TO
BE BUT SURE?"

 

  BORANOVA SIGHED. "POOR SHAPIROV. HE DESERVED A BETTER DEATH."

 

  KONEV SAID, "HE MIGHT HAVE HELD OUT ANOTHER HOUR."

 

  BORANOVA SAID WITH A FROWN, "HE DID NOT PICK AND CHOOSE, YURI."

 

  MORRISON FELT CHILLED. UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SOME
SURROUNDING RED CORPUSCLES, OF A SPECIFIC SPECK OF INTERCELLULAR REGION,
OF THE INTERIOR OF A NEURON. HIS ENVIRONMENT HAD BEEN CIRCUMSCRIBED TO
THE IMMEDIATE.

 

  NOW HE LOOKED OUT OF THE SHIP, THROUGH ITS TRANSPARENT PLASTIC WALLS,
AT WHAT APPEARED TO HIM, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO BE THICKNESS UPON
THICKNESS OF MATTER. ON THEIR PRESENT SCALE, WITH THE SHIP THE SIZE OF A
GLUCOSE MOLECULE AND HIMSELF NOT MUCH MORE THAN THE SIZE OF AN ATOM, THE
BODY OF SHAPIROV WAS LARGER THAN THE PLANET EARTH.

 

  HERE HE WAS, THEN, BURIED IN A PLANETARY OBJECT OF DEAD ORGANIC
MATTER. HE FELT IMPATIENCE OVER THE PAUSE FOR MOURNING. TIME FOR THAT
LATER, BUT MEANWHILE -- HE SAID IN A VOICE THAT WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE
LOUDER THAN IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN, "HOW DO WE GET OUT?"

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE, EYES WIDENING. (MORRISON WAS
CERTAIN THAT IN HER GRIEF FOR SHAPIROV THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HAD BEEN
MOMENTARILY BURIED.)

 

  SHE CLEARED HER THROAT AND MADE A VISIBLE EFFORT TO BE HER USUAL
BUSINESSLIKE SELF. SHE SAID, "WE MUST DEMINIATURIZE TO SOME EXTENT, TO
BEGIN WITH."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHY ONLY TO BEGIN WITH? WHY NOT DEMINIATURIZE ALL THE
WAY TO NORMALITY RIGHT NOW?" THEN, AS THOUGH TO FORESTALL THE INEVITABLE
OBJECTION, "WE WILL INFLICT DAMAGE ON SHAPIROV'S BODY, BUT IT IS A DEAD
BODY AND WE ARE STILL ALIVE. OUR NEEDS COME FIRST."

 

  KALIININ LOOKED AT MORRISON REPROACHFULLY. "EVEN A DEAD BODY DESERVES
RESPECT, ALBERT, ESPECIALLY THE DEAD BODY OF A GREAT SCIENTIST LIKE
ACADEMICIAN PYOTR SHAPIROV."

 

  "YES, BUT SURELY NOT TO THE ENTENT OF RISKING FIVE LIVES." MORRISON'S
IMPATIENCE WAS GROWING. SHAPIROV WAS ONLY SOMEONE HE HAD KNOWN BY
DISTANT REPUTATION AND PERIPHERALLY -- TO MORRISON HE WAS NOT THE
DEMIGOD HE SEEMED TO BE TO THE OTHERS.

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "ASIDE FROM THE QUESTION OF RESPECT, WE ARE ENCLOSED BY
SHAPIROV'S CRANIUM. IF WE EXPAND TO FILL THAT CRANIUM AND THEN TRY TO
CRUMBLE THE CRANIUM BY THE EFFECT OF OUR MINIATURIZATION FIELD, WE WILL
LOSE TOO MUCH ENERGY AND DEMINIATURIZE EXPLOSIVELY. WE MUST FIRST FIND
OUR WAY OUT OF THE CRANIUM."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ALBERT IS RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN. I WILL DEMINIATURIZE TO
CELL SIZE. ARKADY, HAVE THE PEOPLE IN THE GROTTO DETERMINE OUR EXACT
POSITION. YURI, MAKE SURE YOU LOCATE THAT POSITION ACCURATELY ON YOUR
CEREBROGRAPH."

 

  MORRISON STARED OUT THE HULL AT THE DISTANT CELL MEMBRANE -- A
BRIGHTER AND MORE CONTINUOUS SPARKLE, ONE THAT WAS VISIBLE THROUGH THE
OCCASIONAL FLICKER OF LIGHT FROM THE INTERVENING MOLECULES.

 

  THE FIRST INDICATION OF DEMINIATURIZATION WAS THE FACT THAT THE
MOLECULES -- SUBSIDED. (IT WAS THE ONLY WORD MORRISON COULD THINK OF TO
DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED.)

 

  IT WAS AS THOUGH THE LITTLE CURVED SWELLINGS THAT FILLED THE SPACE
AROUND THEM -- AND WHICH MORRISON'S BRAIN CONSTRUCTED OUT OF TWINKLINGS
RATHER THAN SAW DIRECTLY -- SHRANK. IT WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD AS THOUGH
THEY WERE BALLOONS WITH THE AIR BEING LET OUT OF THEM UNTIL THE
SURROUNDINGS SEEMED RELATIVELY SMOOTH.

 

  BUT EVEN AS THE LIQUID AROUND THEM GREW SMOOTH, THE LARGE
MACROMOLECULES IN THE DISTANCE -- THE PROTEINS, THE NUCLEIC ACIDS, THE
STILL LARGER CELLULAR STRUCTURES -- ALSO SHRANK AND, IN DOING SO, GREW
MORE DISTINCT. THE SPARKS OF LIGHT THEY REFLECTED WERE MORE CLOSELY
SPACED.

 

  THE CELL MEMBRANE ITSELF SEEMED TO BE APPROACHING AND IT, TOO, COULD
BE SEEN MORE CLEARLY. IT CAME CLOSER STILL AND YET CLOSER. THE SHIP WAS,
AFTER ALL, IN A NARROW DENDRITE THAT PROJECTED FROM THE CELL BODY ITSELF
AND IF THE SHIP WAS GOING TO ENLARGE TO THE SIZE OF A CELL, IT WOULD
HAVE TO GROW MUCH LARGER THAN THIS MERE PROJECTION.

 

  IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE MEMBRANE WAS GOING TO COLLIDE WITH THE SHIP AND
MORRISON AUTOMATICALLY CLENCHED HIS TEETH AND STEELED HIMSELF FOR THE
SHOCK OF IMPACT.

 

  THERE WAS NONE. THE MEMBRANE CAME CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THEN SIMPLY
SEPARATED AND WAS NOT THERE. IT WAS TOO THIN A STRUCTURE AND TOO LIGHTLY
BOUND TO WITHSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING FORCED INTO A
MINIATURIZATION FIELD. THOUGH THE SHIP WAS DERNINIATURIZING TO AN
EXTENT, IT WAS STILL FAR, FAR SMALLER THAN THE NORMAL WORLD AROUND IT
AND THE MOLECULES OF THE MEMBRANE, ON ENTERING THE FIELD AND SHRINKING,
LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE WHOLE
VANISHED.

 

  MORRISON WATCHED EVERYTHING AFTER THAT WITH FASCINATION. THE
SURROUNDINGS SEEMED CHAOTIC UNTIL, AS OBJECTS CONTINUED TO SHRINK, HE
BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE INTERCELLULAR JUNGLE OF COLLAGEN THAT THEY HAD
ENCOUNTERED BEFORE ENTERING THE NEURON. THAT JUNGLE CONTINUED TO SHRINK,
IN ITS TURN, UNTIL THE COLLAGEN TRUNKS AND CABLES BECAME NOTHING MORE
THAN TWINE.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "AND THAT IS ALL. WE WILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIT WITHIN
A SMALL VEIN."

 

  DEZHNEV GRUNTED. "THAT IS ALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR REMAINING
ENERGY SUPPLY IS NOT GREAT."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IT WILL LAST UNTIL WE FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THE CRANIUM,
SURELY."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "WE CAN HOPE SO. HOWEVER, YOU'RE ONLY THE CAPTAIN OF THE
SHIP, NATASHA; YOU ARE NOT THE CAPTAIN OF THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS."

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD AS THOUGH IN REPROOF AND SAID, "ARKADY, HAVE
THEM DETERMINE OUR POSITION -- AND DON'T LECTURE ME."

 

  KONEV SAID, "I'M CERTAIN, NATALYA, THAT IT IS NOT TERRIBLY IMPORTANT
TO DETERMINE OUR POSITION. IT CANNOT BE MEASURABLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
IT WAS WHEN WE LEFT THE CAPILLARY. ALL OUR WANDERINGS SINCE HAVE MERELY
TAKEN US TO A NEARBY NEURON AND FROM THAT TO A NEIGHBORING NEURON. THE
DIFFERENCE IN POSITION ON EVEN AN ORDINARY MICROSCOPIC SCALE IS SCARCELY
MEASURABLE."

 

  AND THEN, AFTER A WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES, THE POSITION CAME THROUGH
AND KONEV SAID, "AS I TOLD YOU."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THE POSITION, YURI? WE DON'T KNOW
WHICH WAY WE'RE HEADED AND WE CAN ONLY GO IN WHATEVER DIRECTION THAT
MIGHT BE. NOW THAT COMMUNICATIONS ARE RESTORED, WE CAN'T STEER."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WELL, THEN, SINCE THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN
HEAD, WE WILL HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION. I'M SURE THAT ARKADY'S FATHER HAD
A SAYING CONCERNING THAT."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID AT ONCE, "HE USED TO SAY: 'WHEN ONLY ONE COURSE OF ACTION
IS POSSIBLE, THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN DECIDING WHAT TO DO.'"

 

  "YOU SEE?" SAID KONEV. "AND WE WILL FIND THAT WHATEVER DIRECTION WE GO
IN, WE WILL FIND A WAY OUT. MOVE AHEAD, ARKADY."

 

  THE SHIP MOVED FORWARD, PLOUGHING THROUGH THE NOW FRAGILE THREADS OF
COLLAGEN, SPLASHING THROUGH A NEURON, AND CUTTING ACROSS A THIN AXON.
(IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THEY WERE RECENTLY INSIDE ONE OF THOSE AXONS AND
THAT IT HAD SEEMED LIKE A HIGHWAY A HUNDRED KILOMETERS ACROSS.)

 

  MORRISON SAID DRYLY, "SUPPOSE THAT SHAPIROV WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN IT
BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LEAVE HIS BODY. WHAT WOULD WE HAVE DONE?"

 

  "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "I MEAN, WHAT ALTERNATIVE IS THERE TO THIS? WOULD WE NOT HAVE HAD TO
DETERMINE OUR POSITION? AND TO DO THAT, WOULD WE NOT HAVE HAD TO
ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS? AND ONCE THAT WAS DONE, WOULD WE NOT HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO MOVE IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION -- FORWARD? WOULD WE NOT HAVE HAD TO
DEMINIATURIZE IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE TO TRAVEL THE EQUIVALENT OF TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS, BUT MERELY THE EQUIVALENT OF A FEW KILOMETERS?
IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO GET OUT, WOULD WE NOT HAVE HAD TO PUSH OUR WAY
THROUGH THE LIVING NEURONS OF A LIVING SHAPIROV, AS WE ARE NOW PUSHING
OUR WAY THROUGH DYING AND DEAD ONES?"

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WELL -- YES."

 

  "WHERE, THEN, IS THE RESPECT FOR A LIVING BODY? AFTER ALL, WE ACTUALLY
HESITATED TO VIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF A DEAD ONE."

 

  "YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, ALBERT, THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY OPERATION WITH
AN INADEQUATE SHIP. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. AND, IN ANY CASE, IT IS NOT LIKE
YOUR SUGGESTION THAT WE DEMINIATURIZE COMPLETELY IN THE BRAIN, SMASHING
THE CRANIUM AND LEAVING SHAPIROV HEADLESS. OUR PRESENT COURSE, EVEN IF
SHAPIROV WAS ALIVE, WOULD DESTROY A DOZEN NEURONS -- OR POSSIBLY A
HUNDRED -- AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO MAKE SHAPIROV'S
CONDITION APPRECIABLY WORSE. BRAIN NEURONS ARE CONTINUALLY DYING
THROUGHOUT LIFE -- LIKE RED CORPUSCLES."

 

  "NOT QUITE," SAID MORRISON GRIMLY. "RED CORPUSCLES ARE CONTINUALLY
REPLACED. NEURONS NEVER ARE."

 

  KONEV INTERRUPTED, HIS VOICE RATHER LOUD, AS THOUGH HE WERE
IMPATIENTLY OVERRIDING THE IDLE TALK OF OTHERS. "ARKADY, STOP. WE NEED
ANOTHER POSITION DETERMINATION."

 

  THERE WAS AT ONCE A DEAD SILENCE WITHIN THE SHIP, ONE THAT CONTINUED
-- AS THOUGH ANY SPEECH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE MEASUREMENTS BEING MADE
IN THE GROTTO OR MIGHT HAMPER THE CONCENTRATION OF THOSE MAKING THE
MEASUREMENT.

 

  FINALLY DEZHNEV WHISPERED THE MEASUREMENTS TO KONEV, WHO SAID,
"CONFIRM THEM, ARKADY. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THEM RIGHT."

 

  MORRISON UNCLASPED HIMSELF. HE WAS STILL VIRTUALLY WITHOUT MASS, BUT
THERE WAS DISTINCTLY MORE OF IT THAN THERE HAD BEEN WHEN THEY WERE
MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CELL. HE PULLED HIMSELF CAUTIOUSLY UPWARD, SO
THAT HE COULD SEE THE CEREBROGRAPH OVER KONEV'S SHOULDER.

 

  THERE WERE TWO RED SPOTS ON IT, WITH A THIN RED LINE CONNECTING THEM.
THE MAP DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN CONDENSED A BIT, THE TWO DOTS SHRINKING
TOWARD EACH OTHER, AND THEN IT EXPANDED AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT
ORIENTATION.

 

  KONEV'S FINGERS WORKED BUSILY OVER THE COMPUTER KEYS AND THE MAP GREW
DOUBLE AND UNINTERPRETABLE. MORRISON KNEW, HOWEVER, THAT KONEV COULD
VIEW IT THROUGH A DEVICE THAT WOULD RENDER IT STEREOSCOPIC, DISPLAYING A
THIRD DIMENSION.

 

  KONEV LAID DOWN THAT DEVICE AND SAID, "NATALYA, THIS TIME CHANCE IS ON
OUR SIDE. WHEREVER WE ARE AND IN WHATEVER DIRECTION WE WERE TRAVELING,
WE'D BE BOUND TO ENCOUNTER A SMALL VEIN SOONER OR LATER. IN THIS CASE,
IT IS SOONER. WE ARE NOT FAR AWAY AND WE WILL STRIKE IT IN SUCH A WAY
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER."

 

  MORRISON HEAVED AN INTERNAL SIGH OF RELIEF, BUT COULD NOT HELP SAYING,
"AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF CHANCE HAD DICTATED A VEIN VERY FAR
AWAY?"

 

  KONEV SAID COOLLY, "THEN I WOULD HAVE HAD DEZHNEV BREAK COMMUNICATIONS
AGAIN AND STEER TO A CLOSER ONE."

 

  DEZHNEV, HOWEVER, TURNED TO STARE AT MORRISON, MADE A GRIMACE OF
DISAGREEMENT, AND MOUTHED THE WORDS, "NOT ENOUGH ENERGY."

 

  "MOVE FORWARD, ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA PEREMPTORILY, "AND GET TO THE
VEIN."

 

  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, DEZHNEV SAID, "YURI'S MAP IS RIGHT, WHICH I
WOULDN'T HAVE BET ON WITH ANY ENTHUSIASM. THAT'S IT AHEAD."

 

  MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF STARING AT A CURVING WALL REACHING INTO THE
INDEFINITE HAZE UPWARD AND DOWNWARD AND WITH JUST A FAINT SUGGESTION OF
TILING TO IT. IF IT WAS A VEIN, IT WAS AS YET NOT VERY FAR REMOVED FROM
A CAPILLARY. MORRISON WONDERED UNEASILY IF THE SHIP WOULD BE ABLE TO FIT
INSIDE IT.

 

  76.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "IS THERE ANY WAY, SOPHIA, THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE SHIP
AN ELECTRIC CHARGE PATTERN THAT WILL SLIP US INTO THE VEIN?"

 

  KALIININ LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND MORRISON, HOLDING UP HIS HAND, SAID, "I
DON'T THINK SO, NATALYA. THE INDIVIDUAL CELLS MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY DEAD
EVEN NOW, BUT CERTAINLY THE ORGANIZATION WITHIN THEM HAS BEEN DESTROYED.
I DON'T THINK ANY CELL IN THE BODY CAN TAKE US IN BY PINOCYTOSIS OR BY
ANY OTHER MEANS.

 

  "WHAT DO I DO, THEN?" SAID DEZHNEV UNHAPPILY, "FORCE MY WAY IN?"

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID KONEV. "LEAN AGAINST THE VEIN WALL. A SMALL BIT OF
IT WILL THEN MINIATURIZE AND DISINTEGRATE AND YOU CAN MOVE IN. YOU WON'T
HAVE TO USE YOUR MOTORS MUCH."

 

  "AH," SAID DEZHNEV, "THE EXPERT SPEAKS. THE VEIN WILL MINIATURIZE AND
DISINTEGRATE AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR FIELD AND THAT WOULD TAKE ENERGY, TOO
-- MORE ENERGY THAN FORCING OUR WAY IN WOULD."

 

  "ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA, "DON'T BE ANGRY. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR IT.
USE YOUR MOTORS MODERATELY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST WEAKENING OF
THE VEIN WALL THROUGH MINIATURIZATION TO BURST THROUGH. USING BOTH
TECHNIQUES WILL CONSUME LESS ENERGY THAN EITHER SEPARATELY."

 

  "WE CAN HOPE SO," SAID DEZHNEV, "BUT SAYING SO DOESN'T MAKE IT SO.
WHEN I WAS LITTLE, MY FATHER SAID TO ME ONCE: 'VEHEMENCE, MY LITTLE SON,
IS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH.' HE TOLD ME THIS WHEN I SWORE WITH GREAT
EARNESTNESS THAT I HAD NOT BROKEN HIS PIPE. HE ASKED ME IF I UNDERSTOOD
THE STATEMENT. I SAID I DIDN'T AND HE EXPLAINED IT TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.
THEN HE WALLOPED ME."

 

  "YES, ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA, "BUT MOVE IN NOW."

 

  KONEV SAID, "IT'S NOT AS THOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO FLOOD THE BRAIN WITH
BLOOD. IT WOULDN'T MATTER NOW THAT SHAPIROV IS DEAD, BUT, AS IT HAPPENS,
THE BLOOD ISN'T FLOWING NOW. VIRTUALLY NOTHING WILL LEAK."

 

  "AH," SAID DEZHNEV, "THIS RAISES AN INTERESTING POINT. ORDINARILY,
ONCE WE ENTER A VEIN, THE BLOOD FLOW WOULD CARRY US IN A PARTICULAR
DIRECTION. WITHOUT BLOOD FLOW, I MUST USE MY ENGINES -- BUT IN WHICH
DIRECTION MUST WE GO?"

 

  "ONCE WE PENETRATE AT THIS POINT," SAID KONEV CALMLY, "YOU WILL TURN
TO THE RIGHT. SO MY CEREBROGRAPH SAYS."

 

  "BUT IF THERE IS NO CURRENT TO TURN ME TO THE RIGHT AND IF I ENTER AT
AN ANGLE TO THE LEFT?"

 

  "ARKADY, YOU WILL ENTER AT AN ANGLE TO THE RIGHT. MY CEREBROGRAPH
TELLS ME THAT, TOO. JUST PUSH IN, WILL YOU?"

 

  "GO AHEAD, ARKADY," SAID BORANOVA. "WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RELY ON
YURI'S CEREBROGRAPH."

 

  THE SHIP MOVED FORWARD AND, AS THE PROW TOUCHED THE VEIN WALL,
MORRISON COULD FEEL THE SLIGHT VIBRATION OF THE LABORING MOTORS. AND
THEN THE WALL SIMPLY GAVE AND PULLED AWAY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE SHIP
WAS INSIDE.

 

  DEZHNEV STOPPED THE MOTORS AT ONCE. THE SHIP MOVED IN AT A RAPIDLY
SLOWING PACE, REBOUNDED OFF THE FAR WALL (MAINTAINING CONTACT SO BRIEFLY
AS TO CAUSE NO DAMAGE THAT MORRISON COULD SEE), AND STRAIGHTENED OUT
WITH THE LONG AXIS OF THE SHIP ALONG THE ENORMOUS TUNNEL OF THE VEIN.
THE SHIP'S WIDTH WAS BETTER THAN HALF THE WIDTH OF THE BLOOD VESSEL.

 

  "WELL," SAID DEZHNEV, "ARE WE POINTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? IF WE'RE
NOT, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE. I CAN'T BACK UP. WE FIT THE VEIN TOO
TIGHTLY FOR ALBERT TO GET OUT AND TURN US AROUND AND WE HAVE AN
INSUFFICIENT REMAINING SUPPLY OF ENERGY TO MINIATURIZE FURTHER AND MAKE
SUCH A TURN POSSIBLE."

 

  "YOU'RE POINTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION," SAID KONEV STERNLY. "JUST GET
MOVING AND YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH. THE VESSEL WILL GET LARGER AS WE
MOVE."

 

  "LET'S HOPE IT DOES. -- AND IF IT DOES, HOW FAR DO WE HAVE TO TRAVEL
BEFORE WE CAN MOVE OUT OF THE BODY?"

 

  "I CAN'T SAY YET," SAID KONEV. "I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE VEIN ON MY
CEREBROGRAPH, CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE GROTTO, AND ARRANGE FOR THE
INSERTION OF A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE INTO THE VEIN AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO
THE POSITION IN WHICH WE'LL BE WHEN WE EMERGE FROM WITHIN THE CRANIUM."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID, "MAY I EXPLAIN THAT WE CANNOT MOVE ON FOREVER. WHAT WITH
MINIATURIZING AND DEMINIATURIZING, WITH STEERING AT VERY LOW EFFICIENCY,
WITH WRONG CAPILLARIES, AND WITH CHASING AFTER ALBERT WHEN HE WAS LOST,
WE HAVE USED UP MUCH MORE ENERGY THAN WE HAD COUNTED ON USING. WE HAD
MUCH MORE ENERGY THAN WE THOUGHT WE'D NEED, BUT, EVEN SO, WE'VE ALMOST
USED IT ALL."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "DO YOU MEAN WE'RE OUT OF ENERGY?"

 

  "JUST ABOUT. HAVEN'T I BEEN TELLING YOU THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE?" SAID
DEZHNEV. "HAVEN'T I BEEN WARNING YOU WE WERE RUNNING LOW?"

 

  "BUT HOW LOW ARE WE? ARE YOU SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO CARRY US
OUT OF THE CRANIUM?"

 

  "ORDINARILY, WE WOULD HAVE PLENTY FOR THAT, EVEN NOW. IF WE WERE IN A
LIVING VEIN, WE COULD COUNT ON A BLOOD CURRENT SWEEPING US ALONG. BUT
THERE IS NO CURRENT. SHAPIROV IS DEAD AND HIS HEART ISN'T BEATING. THAT
MEANS I'LL HAVE TO FORCE MY WAY THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM WITH MY MOTORS
GOING AND THE COOLER THE STREAM GETS, THE MORE VISCOUS IT WILL BECOME,
THE HARDER THE MOTORS WILL HAVE TO WORK, AND THE MORE RAPIDLY THE ENERGY
SUPPLY WILL RUN OUT."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WE HAVE ONLY A FEW CENTIMETERS TO GO."

 

  DEZHNEV SAID FURIOUSLY, "ONLY A FEW? LESS THAN THE WIDTH OF MY PALM?
REALLY? AT OUR PRESENT SIZE, WE'VE GOT KILOMETERS TO GO."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "SHOULD WE DEMINIATURIZE FURTHER, THEN?"

 

  "WE CAN'T." DEZHNEV WAS NOW SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY. "WE DON'T HAVE THE
ENERGY FOR IT. UNCONTROLLED DEMINIATURIZATION TAKES NO ENERGY; IT
RELEASES ENERGY. BUT CONTROLLED DEMINIATURIZATION -- LOOK, ALBERT, IF
YOU JUMP OUT OF A HIGH WINDOW, YOU WILL REACH THE GROUND WITHOUT EFFORT.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE THE ORDEAL AND IF YOU WANT TO BE LOWERED
SLOWLY WHILE YOU HANG ON TO A ROPE, THAT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT.
UNDERSTAND?"

 

  MORRISON MUTTERED, "I UNDERSTAND."

 

  KALIININ'S HAND STOLE TO HIS AND SQUEEZED IT GENTLY. SHE SAID IN A LOW
VOICE, "DON'T MIND DEZHNEV. HE GRUMBLES AND HOWLS, BUT HE'LL GET US
THERE."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "ARKADY, IF VEHEMENCE DOESN'T GUARANTEE TRUTH, AS YOU
TOLD US JUST NOW, NEITHER DOES IT GUARANTEE A COOL HEAD AND A SOLUTION.
RATHER, THE REVERSE. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUSH YOUR WAY ALONG THE VEIN
AND PERHAPS THE ENERGY WILL LAST UNTIL WE REACH THE HYPODERMIC."

 

  DEZHNEV SCOWLED AND SAID, "IT'S WHAT I WILL DO, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO
KEEP A COOL HEAD, YOU MUST LET ME GET RID OF SOME HEAT."

 

  THE SHIP BEGAN TO MOVE AND MORRISON THOUGHT TO HIMSELF: EVERY METER WE
GO IS A METER CLOSER TO THE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.

 

  IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE AS A COMFORTING THOUGHT, SINCE TO FAIL TO
REACH THE NEEDLE BY A SMALL DISTANCE MIGHT BE AS FATAL AS TO FAIL BY A
LARGE DISTANCE. YET IT WORKED TO SLOW THE BEAT OF HIS HEART AND IT GAVE
HIM A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AS HE WATCHED THE WALL SLIDE RAPIDLY
BACKWARD.

 

  THE RED CORPUSCLES AND PLATELETS SEEMED FAR MORE NUMEROUS NOW THAN
THEY HAD BEEN IN THE ARTERIES AND CAPILLARIES ON THE WAY IN. THEN THERE
HAD BEEN A BLOOD FLOW AND THERE HAD BEEN ONLY THE RELATIVELY FEW OBJECTS
IN THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAD MOVED ALONG THE FLOW WITH THEM.
NOW THE VARIOUS FORMED BODIES WERE LARGELY MOTIONLESS AND THE SHIP MOVED
PAST WHAT SEEMED COUNTLESS NUMBERS, SQUEEZING THEM RIGHT AND LEFT AND
LEAVING THEM BEHIND, BOBBING, IN THEIR WAKE.

 

  THEY EVEN PASSED AN OCCASIONAL WHITE CELL, LARGE AND GLOBULAR AND
QUIESCENT. NOW, THOUGH, THEY WERE TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE PRESENCE
OF A FOREIGN OBJECT SPEEDING BY. IN ONE CASE, THE SHIP SIMPLY WHIPPED
THROUGH A WHITE CELL AND LEFT IT SPRAWLING BEHIND.

 

  KONEV SAID, "WE ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE VEIN IS NOW
DISTINCTLY WIDER THAN IT WAS."

 

  AND SO IT WAS. MORRISON HAD NOTICED THAT WITHOUT MANAGING TO GRASP THE
SIGNIFICANCE. HE HAD BEEN TOO INTENT ON SIMPLY MOVING.

 

  HE FELT A SMALL SURGE OF HOPE. TO HAVE BEEN GOING IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTAL DISASTER. THE VEIN WOULD HAVE NARROWED
AND BURST, LEAVING THEM ADRIFT IN GRAY MATTER WITH, PERHAPS,
INSUFFICIENT FUEL TO FIND AND REACH ANOTHER VEIN.

 

  KONEV WAS TAKING DOWN SOMETHING THAT DEZHNEV WAS REPEATING TO HIM. HE
NODDED AND SAID, "HAVE THEM CONFIRM THOSE FIGURES, ARKADY. -- GOOD!"

 

  HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH HIS CEREBROGRAPH AND THEN SAID, "LISTEN, THEY
KNOW THE VEIN WE'RE IN AND THEY WILL BE INSERTING A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE AT
A SPECIFIC SPOT THAT I HAVE MARKED OFF ON THE CEREBROGRAPH. WE WILL
REACH IT IN HALF AN HOUR OR A LITTLE LESS. -- CAN YOU KEEP GOING FOR
HALF AN HOUR, ARKADY?"

 

  "MORE LIKELY A LITTLE LESS. IF THE HEART WAS BEATING --"

 

  "YES, I KNOW, BUT IT ISN'T," SAID KONEV. THEN HE SAID, "NATALYA, MAY I
HAVE WHATEVER RECORDS YOU HAVE CONCERNING WHAT WE HAVE SENSED OF
SHAPIROV'S THOUGHT PROCESSES? I AM GOING TO SEND THE RAW DATA --
COMPLETEOUT TO THE GROTTO."

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "YOU MEAN IN CASE WE DON'T MAKE IT OUT."

 

  "THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN. THIS MATERIAL IS WHAT WE WENT IN FOR AND
THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE IT PERISH WITH US IF WE CAN'T GET OUT."

 

  "THAT'S A PROPER ATTITUDE, YURI," SAID BORANOVA.

 

  "PROVIDED," SAID KONEV, HIS VOICE SUDDENLY TAKING ON A TINGE OF ANGER,
"THE DATA HAS ANY VALUE AT ALL." BRIEFLY, HE GLARED AT MORRISON.

 

  KONEV THEN BENT TOWARD DEZHNEV AND TOGETHER THE TWO BEGAN
ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION THEY HAD COLLECTED, COMPUTER
TO COMPUTER, FROM TINY TO LARGE, FROM INSIDE A VEIN TO THE OUTSIDE
WORLD.

 

  KALIININ WAS STILL HOLDING MORRISON'S HAND, PERHAPS AS MUCH FOR
COMFORT TO HERSELF AS TO HIM, MORRISON THOUGHT.

 

  HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE, "WHAT HAPPENS, SOPHIA, IF WE RUN OUT OF ENERGY
BEFORE WE REACH THE NEEDLE?"

 

  SHE LIFTED HER EYEBROWS BRIEFLY AND SAID, "WE'LL JUST HAVE TO REMAIN
PASSIVELY IN PLACE. THE PEOPLE IN THE GROTTO WILL TRY TO REACH US
WHEREVER WE ARE."

 

  "WE WON'T DEMINIATURIZE EXPLOSIVELY AS SOON AS THE ENERGY IS GONE,
WILL WE?"

 

  "OH NO. MINIATURIZATION IS A METASTABLE STATE. YOU REMEMBER WE
EXPLAINED THAT. WE'LL STAY AS WE ARE INDEFINITELY. EVENTUALLY --
SOMETIME -- THIS CHANCE PSEUDO-BROWNIAN MOTION OF EXPANDING AND
CONTRACTING WILL SET UP SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION, BUT THAT MIGHT
NOT BE FOR -- WHO KNOWS?"

 

  "YEARS?"

 

  "POSSIBLY."

 

  "THAT WON'T DO US ANY GOOD, OF COURSE," SAID MORRISON. "WE'LL DIE OF
ASPHYXIATION. WITHOUT ENERGY, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECYCLE OUR AIR
SUPPLY."

 

  "I SAID THE PEOPLE IN THE GROTTO WOULD TRY TO REACH US. OUR COMPUTERS
WILL STILL BE WORKING AND THEY CAN HOME IN ON US, CUT TO THE VEIN AND
INTO IT, AND SPOT US ELECTRONICALLY -- OR EVEN VISUALLY."

 

  "HOW CAN THEY FIND ONE CELL AMONG FIFTY TRILLION?"

 

  KALIININ PATTED HIS HAND. "YOU ARE IN A PESSIMISTIC MOOD, ALBERT.
WE'RE AN EASILY RECOGNIZABLE CELL -- AND A BROADCASTING ONE."

 

  "I THINK I WOULD FEEL BETTER IF WE FIND THE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE NOW AND
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR US."

 

  "SO WOULD I. I AM MERELY POINTING OUT THAT RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY AND
NOT FINDING THE NEEDLE IS NOT THE ULTIMATE END."

 

  "AND IF WE DO FIND IT?"

 

  "THEN WE ARE DRAWN OUT AND THE GROTTO'S OWN ENERGY SOURCES WILL BE
APPLIED TO THE TASK OF DERNINIATURIZING US."

 

  "CAN'T THEY DO IT NOW?"

 

  "WE'RE TOO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY MASSES OF UNMINIATURIZED MATERIAL AND
IT WOULD BE TOO DIFFICULT TO FOCUS THE DEMINIATURIZING FIELD WITH
SUFFICIENT ACCURACY. ONCE WE ARE OUT AND VISIBLE TO THEM, THE CONDITIONS
WILL BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT."

 

  AT THIS POINT, DEZHNEV SAID, "HAVE WE TRANSMITTED EVERYTHING, YURI?"

 

  "YES. EVERYTHING."

 

  "THEN IT IS MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE ONLY ENOUGH ENERGY TO
CONTINUE MOVING THIS SHIP FOR FIVE MINUTES. PERHAPS LESS, BUT CERTAINLY
NOT MORE."

 

  77.

 

  MORRISON, KALIININ'S HAND STILL IN HIS, SQUEEZED CONVULSIVELY AND THE
YOUNG WOMAN WINCED.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I'M SORRY, SOPHIA."

 

  HE RELEASED HER HAND AND SHE RUBBED IT VIGOROUSLY.

 

  BORANOVA SAID, "WHERE ARE WE, YURI? CAN WE GET TO THE NEEDLE?"

 

  "I SHOULD SAY YES," SAID KONEV. "SLOW DOWN, ARKADY. CONSERVE WHAT
ENERGY YOU HAVE."

 

  "NO, BELIEVE ME," SAID DEZHNEV. "AT THE PRESENT SPEED, I AM CUTTING
THROUGH THE BLOOD WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE TURBULENCE, THANKS TO THE
STREAMLINING AND SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SHIP. IF I SLOW DOWN,
THERE'LL BE MORE TURBULENCE AND ENERGY WASTE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "BUT WE DON'T WANT TO OVERSHOOT THE MARK."

 

  "WE WON'T. ANY TIME YOU WANT ME TO CUT THE MOTORS, WE BEGIN TO SLOW
DOWN AT ONCE BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD VISCOSITY. AS WE SLOW DOWN, THE
TURBULENCE BUILDS, WE SLOW DOWN FASTER, AND IN TEN SECONDS WE'RE
MOTIONLESS. IF WE HAD OUR NORMAL MASS AND INERTIA, THE RAPID PACE OF
SLOWING WOULD PLASTER US ALL UP AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE SHIP."

 

  "STOP WHEN I TELL YOU, THEN."

 

  MORRISON HAD RISEN AND WAS LOOKING OVER KONEV'S SHOULDER AGAIN. THE
CEREBROGRAPH, HE JUDGED, MUST BE AT ENORMOUS EXPANSION, PERHAPS AT
MAXIMUM. THE THIN RED LINE THAT HAD MARKED THE PATH OF THE SHIP BY DEAD
RECKONING WAS NOW THICK AND WAS APPROACHING A SMALL GREEN CIRCLE, WHICH,
MORRISON SURMISED, MUST REPRESENT THE POSITION OF THE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.

 

  BUT IT WAS DEAD RECKONING AND IT COULD BE OFF A BIT. KONEV WAS
ALTERNATING HIS GAZE BETWEEN THE CEREBROGRAPH AND THE VIEW UP AHEAD OF
THE SHIP.

 

  "WE SHOULD HAVE AIMED FOR AN ARTERY," MORRISON SAID SUDDENLY. "THEY'RE
EMPTY AFTER DEATH. WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO WASTE ENERGY ON VISCOSITY AND
TURBULENCE."

 

  KONEV SAID, "USELESS IDEA. THE SHIP CANNOT PROGRESS THROUGH AIR." HE
MIGHT HAVE GONE ON, BUT AT THIS POINT HE STIFFENED AND CRIED OUT, "STOP,
ARKADY! STOP!"

 

  DEZHNEV HIT A KNOB HARD WITH THE HEEL OF HIS HAND. IT MOVED INWARD AND
MORRISON FELT HIMSELF SWAY GENTLY FORWARD AS THE SHIP SLOWED AND STOPPED
ALMOST AT ONCE.

 

  KONEV POINTED. THERE WAS A LARGE CIRCLE, GLOWING WITH AN ORANGE LIGHT.
HE SAID, "THEY'RE USING FIBER OPTIC METHODS TO MAKE SURE THE TIP GLOWS.
THEY SAID I WOULDN'T MISS IT."

 

  "BUT WE HAVE MISSED IT," SAID MORRISON TIGHTLY, "WE'RE LOOKING AT IT,
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE. TO GET INTO IT, WE HAVE TO TURN -- AND THAT MEANS
THAT DEZHNEV HAS TO UNHOOK COMMUNICATIONS AGAIN."

 

  "NO USE," SAID DEZHNEV. "I HAVE ENOUGH POWER IN MY ENGINES TO HAVE
KEPT US GOING ANOTHER FORTY-FIVE SECONDS MAYBE, BUT I CERTAINLY DO NOT
HAVE ENOUGH TO START US MOVING FROM SCRATCH. WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT DEAD
IN THE WATER AND CANNOT MOVE AGAIN."

 

  "WELL, THEN?" BEGAN MORRISON WITH WHAT WAS ALMOST A WAIL.

 

  "WELL, THEN," SAID KONEV, "THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF MOTION THAT IS
POSSIBLE. THAT HYPODERMIC NEEDLE HAS INTELLIGENCE AT THE OTHER END.
ARKADY, TELL THEM TO PUSH IT IN VERY SLOWLY."

 

  THE ORANGE CIRCLE EXPANDED SLOWLY, BECOMING SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "IT'S GOING TO MISS US."

 

  KONEV MADE NO REPLY TO THAT, BUT LEANED OVER TOWARD ARKADY TO SPEAK
DIRECTLY INTO THE TRANSMITTER. THE ORANGE ELLIPSE BECAME, FOR A MOMENT,
MORE MARKEDLY ELLIPTICAL, BUT THIS CEASED AFTER A BARK FROM KONEV. IT
BECAME NEARLY CIRCULAR AFTER THAT. THE NEEDLE WAS CLOSE NOW AND WAS
POINTING AT THEM.

 

  AND THEN THERE WAS SUDDEN MOTION EVERYWHERE. THE FAINT OUTLINES OF THE
RED CORPUSCLES AND THE OCCASIONAL PLATELET, MOVED, AND CONVERGED TOWARD
AND THROUGH THE CIRCLE. AND THE SHIP WAS MOVING, TOO.

 

  MORRISON LOOKED UP AND AROUND AS THE ORANGE CIRCLE MOVED PAST THEM
NEATLY ON ALL SIDES, THEN SLIPPED BEHIND THE SHIP, SHRANK RAPIDLY, AND
DISAPPEARED.

 

  KONEV SAID WITH GRIM SATISFACTION, "THEY'VE SUCKED US IN. FROM THIS
POINT ON, WE SIT QUIETLY. THEY WILL HANDLE EVERYTHING."

 

  78.

 

  NOW MORRISON DID HIS BEST TO WASH AWAY THOUGHT, TO CLOSE HIS MIND.
EITHER HE WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE STANDARD WORLD, TO NORMALITY, TO
REALITY, OR HE WOULD DIE IN A MICROBLINK AND THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE
WOULD GO ON WITHOUT HIM -- AS IT WOULD DO, IN ANY CASE, IN TWENTY YEARS,
OR THIRTY, OR FORTY.

 

  HE SHUT HIS EYES FIRMLY AND TRIED TO RESPOND TO NOTHING, NOT EVEN TO
THE BEATING OF HIS HEART. AT ONE POINT HE FELT A LIGHT TOUCH ON HIS LEFT
HAND. THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE KALIININ. HE WITHDREW HIS HAND -- NOT
SUDDENLY IN REJECTION, BUT SLOWLY, AS THOUGH SIMPLY TO SAY: "NOT NOW."

 

  AT ANOTHER POINT, HE HEARD BORANOVA SAY, "TELL THEM, ARKADY, TO
EVACUATE SECTION C, TO PUT IN STRICTLY LONG-DISTANCE CONTROLS. IF WE GO,
THERE IS NO POINT IN CARRYING ANYONE WITH US."

 

  MORRISON WONDERED IF SECTION C WERE INDEED EVACUATED. HE WOULD
EVACUATE IF HE WERE ORDERED TO OR EVEN IF HE WERE NOT ORDERED TO, BUT
THERE MIGHT BE THOSE LUNATICS WHO WOULD BE ANXIOUS TO BE ON THE SPOT
WHEN THE FIRST CREW TO EXPLORE A LIVING BODY RETURNED SAFELY. -- SO THEY
COULD TELL THEIR GRANDCHILDREN, HE SUPPOSED.

 

  WHAT HAPPENED TO SUCH PEOPLE, HE WONDERED, IF THEY ENDED UP NOT HAVING
GRANDCHILDREN -- IF THEY DIED TOO YOUNG TO SEE THEM -- IF THEIR CHILDREN
CHOSE NEVER TO HAVE CHILDREN -- IF THE --

 

  DIMLY, HE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS DELIBERATELY IMMERSING HIMSELF IN
NONSENSE AND TRIVIA. ONE CAN'T REALLY THINK OF NOTHING AND ESPECIALLY
NOT IF ONE HAS SPENT A LIFETIME DEVOTING ONE'S SELF TO THOUGHT, BUT ONE
CAN THINK OF SOMETHING UTTERLY UNIMPORTANT. THERE ARE, AFTER ALL, SO
MANY MORE POSSIBLE THOUGHTS THAT ARE UNIMPORTANT RATHER THAN IMPORTANT,
TRIVIAL RATHER THAN VITAL, NONSENSICAL RATHER THAN SENSIBLE, THAT --

 

  HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP. THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARD MADE HIM
FEEL CERTAIN HE HAD. HE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BE
SO COLD-BLOODED, BUT IT WASN'T COLD BLOOD; IT WAS WEANNESS, RELIEF FROM
TENSION, THE FEELING THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS MAKING DECISIONS, THAT HE
HIMSELF MIGHT BE TOTALLY RELAXED AT LAST. AND PERHAPS (ALTHOUGH HE
DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT), IT HAD ALL BEEN TOO MUCH AND HE HAD SIMPLY
PASSED OUT.

 

  AND AGAIN HE FELT A LIGHT TOUCH ON HIS LEFT HAND AND THIS TIME IT DID
NOT GO AWAY. HE STIRRED AND OPENED HIS EYES ON SOMETHING THAT LOOKED
LIKE ORDINARY ILLUMINATION. TOO ORDINARY -- IT HURT HIS EYES. HE BLINKED
RAPIDLY AND THEY WATERED.

 

  KALIININ WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. "WAKE UP, ALBERT!"

 

  HE WIPED AT HIS EYES, BEGAN TO MAKE THE NATURAL INTERPRETATION OF HIS
SURROUNDINGS, AND SAID, "ARE WE BACK?"

 

  "WE ARE BACK. ALL IS WELL. WE ARE SAFE AND WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU.
YOU'RE NEAREST THE DOOR."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED BACK AT THE OPEN DOOR AND STARTED TO HIS FEET, RISING
A FEW INCHES AND SINKING BACK. "I'M HEAVY. "

 

  KALIININ SAID, "I KNOW. I FEEL LIKE AN ELEPHANT MYSELF. JUST GET UP
SLOWLY. I'LL HELP YOU."

 

  "NO NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT." HE FENDED HER OFF. THE ROOM WAS CROWDED.
HIS VISION HAD CLEARED TO THE POINT WHERE HE COULD SEE THE CROWD, FACE
UPON FACE, LOOKING TOWARD HIM, SMILING, WATCHING. HE DID NOT WANT THEM
-- SOVIET CITIZENS, ALL -- TO SEE THE SOLE AMERICAN HELPED TO HIS FEET
BY A YOUNG SOVIET WOMAN.

 

  SLOWLY, A LITTLE DRUNKENLY BUT BY HIMSELF, HE ROSE TO HIS FEET,
STEPPED SIDEWISE TO THE DOOR AND VERY CAREFULLY LET HIMSELF DOWN TO A
SMALL FLIGHT OF STAIRS. HALF A DOZEN PAIRS OF ARMS REACHED OUT TO HELP
HIM, UTTERLY DISREGARDING HIS WORDS: "IT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T NEED
HELP."

 

  THEN HE SAID SHARPLY, "WAIT!"

 

  BEFORE STEPPING TO SOLID GROUND, HE TURNED AND LOOKED PAST KALIININ,
WHO WAS RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

 

  "WHAT IS IT, ALBERT?" SHE ASKED.

 

  HE SAID, "I WAS JUST TAKING A LAST LOOK AT THE SHIP BECAUSE I DON'T
INTEND EVER TO SEE IT AGAIN -- NOT AT A DISTANCE, NOT IN FILMS, NOT IN
ANY FORM OF REPRODUCTION."

 

  THEN HE WAS ON NORMAL GROUND AGAIN AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED. IT WAS
WITH RELIEF THAT MORRISON SAW THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS HELPED DOWN.

 

  THERE WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF IMPROMPTU CELEBRATION, BUT IT
WAS BORANOVA WHO STEPPED FORWARD, LOOKING DISTINCTLY DISHEVELED AND MUCH
UNLIKE HER USUAL CALM, WELL-CARED-FOR SELF -- ALL THE MORE SO SINCE SHE
WAS WEARING THE THIN COTTON COVERALL THAT DID VERY LITTLE TO HIDE THE
MATURE LINES OF HER BODY.

 

  "FELLOW WORKERS," SHE SAID, "I'M SURE THERE WILL BE APPROPRIATE
CEREMONIES AT SOME REASONABLE TIME TO MARK THIS FANTASTIC VOYAGE OF
OURS, BUT PLEASE, WE ARE IN NO CONDITION TO JOIN YOU NOW. WE MUST REST
AND RECOVER FROM AN ARDUOUS TIME AND WE BEG YOUR INDULGENCE."

 

  THEY WERE ALL LED OFF TO WILD SHOUTS AND FRANTIC WAVING AND ONLY
DEZHNEV HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO TAKE A GLASS OFFERED TO HIM THAT
CONTAINED SOMETHING THAT WAS EITHER WATER OR VODKA AND MORRISON, FOR
ONE, HAD NO DOUBT AS TO WHICH OF THE ALTERNATIVES WAS, IN FACT, THE
CASE. THE BROAD SMILE ON DEZHNEV'S DAMP FACE AS HE SIPPED MADE IT
CERTAIN.

 

  MORRISON SAID TO KALIININ, "HOW LONG WERE WE ON THE SHIP?"

 

  "I THINK IT WAS OVER ELEVEN HOURS," SAID KALIININ.

 

  MORRISON SHOOK HIS HEAD. "IT SEEMED MORE LIKE ELEVEN YEARS."

 

  "I KNOW," SHE SAID, SMILING SLIGHTLY, "BUT CLOCKS LACK IMAGINATION."

 

  "ONE OF DEZHNEV SENIOR'S APHORISMS, SOPHIA?"

 

  "NO. ONE OF MY OWN."

 

  "WHAT I WANT," SAID MORRISON, "IS A CHANCE AT THE BATHROOM, AND A
SHOWER, AND FRESH CLOTHES, AND A GOOD DINNER, AND A CHANCE TO SHOUT AND
SCREAM, AND A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. IN THAT ORDER, I THINK, ESPECIALLY
WITH THE BATHROOM COMING FIRST."

 

  "YOU'LL HAVE IT ALL," SAID KALIININ, "AS WILL THE REST OF US."

 

  AND THEY DID AND THE DINNER SEEMED TO MORRISON TO BE PARTICULARLY
SATISFACTORY. THROUGHOUT THEIR STAY ON THE SHIP, TENSION HAD MANAGED TO
SUPPRESS HIS APPETITE, BUT SUCH THINGS ARE MERELY DEFERRED AND HUNGER
WAS GNAWING WITH A VENGEANCE ONCE MORRISON FELT TRULY SAFE, TRULY
COMFORTABLE, TRULY CLEAN, AND TRULY CLOTHED.

 

  THE MAIN COURSE AT THE DINNER WAS A ROAST GOOSE OF ENORMOUS SIZE WHICH
DEZHNEV CARVED, SAYING, "BE ABSTEMIOUS, MY FRIENDS, FOR AS MY FATHER
USED TO SAY: 'EATING TOO MUCH KILLS MORE QUICKLY THAN EATING TOO
LITTLE.'"

 

  HAVING SAID THIS, HE SERVED HIMSELF A MUCH LARGER HELPING THAN HE
SERVED ANYONE ELSE.

 

  THE ONE OUTSIDER PRESENT WAS A VERY BLOND TALL MAN, WHO WAS INTRODUCED
AS THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE GROTTO, SOMETHING WHICH COULD BE SEEN
AT ONCE, SINCE HE WAS IN FULL UNIFORM WITH A SPATE OF DECORATIONS. THE
OTHERS SEEMED EXTRAORDINARILY POLITE TO HIM AND EXTRAORDINARILY
UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE SAME TIME.

 

  THROUGHOUT THE MEAL, MORRISON FELT THE TENSION RETURNING. THE
COMMANDER LOOKED AT HIM OFTEN, WITH UNSMILING GRAVITY, BUT SAID NOTHING
TO HIM DIRECTLY. BECAUSE OF THE COMMANDER'S PRESENCE, HE FELT UABLE TO
ASK THE IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THEN, FINALLY, WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED
IT AFTER THE COMMANDER'S DEPARTURE, HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF TOO
SLEEPY. HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ARGUE IT OUT PROPERLY IF THERE WERE ANY
COMPLICATIONS.

 

  AND WHEN HE FINALLY MANAGED TO TUMBLE INTO BED, HIS LAST SEMICONSCIOUS
THOUGHT WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE COMPLICATIONS.

 

  79.

 

  BREAKFAST WAS LATE AND MORRISON FOUND THAT IT WAS FOR TWO. ONLY
BORANOVA JOINED HIM.

 

  HE WAS MILDLY DISAPPOINTED, FOR HE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THE PRESENCE
OF SOPHIA KALIININ, BUT WHEN SHE FAILED TO APPEAR, HE DECIDED NOT TO ASK
AFTER HER. THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS HE WOULD HAVE TO ASK.

 

  BORANOVA LOOKED TIRED, AS THOUGH SHE HAD NOT HAD ENOUGH SLEEP, BUT SHE
LOOKED HAPPY, TOO. OR PERHAPS (MORRISON THOUGHT) "HAPPY" WAS TOO STRONG
A WORD. CONTENTED, RATHER.

 

  SHE SAID, "I HAD A GOOD TALK WITH THE COMMANDER LAST NIGHT AND THERE
WAS A TWO-WAY VIDEO CALL WITH MOSCOW. CAREFULLY SHIELDED. COMRADE
RASHCHIN HIMSELF SPOKE WITH ME AND WAS CLEARLY PLEASED IN THE HIGHEST
DEGREE. HE IS NOT A DEMONSTRATIVE MAN BUT HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN IN
TOUCH WITH EVENTS ALL YESTERDAY AND THAT, DURING THE INTERVAL IN WHICH
WE WERE NOT IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, HE HAD BEEN UNABLE
TO EAT OR TO DO ANYTHING BUT PACE BACK AND FORTH. THAT, PERHAPS, WAS AN
EXAGGERATION. HE EVEN SAID HE HAD WEPT WITH JOY AT HEARING THAT WE WERE
ALL SAFE AND THAT MAY BE TRUE. UNDEMONSTRATIVE MEN CAN BE EMOTIONAL WHEN
THE DAM BREAKS."

 

  "IT SOUNDS GOOD FOR YOU, NATALYA."

 

  "FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, ACCORDING TO THE
TENTATIVE SCHEDULE UNDER WHICH WE HAD WORKED, WE WERE NOT EXPECTED TO
LAUNCH A VOYAGE INTO A LIVING HUMAN BODY FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. TO
HAVE DONE SO WITH A GROSSLY INADEQUATE SHIP AND TO HAVE COME OUT OF IT
ALIVE IS VIEWED AS A GREAT TRIUMPH. EVEN THE BUREAUCRACY IN MOSCOW
UNDERSTOOD THE EMERGENCY UNDER WHICH WE LABORED."

 

  "I DOUBT THAT WE REALLY GOT WHAT WE WERE AFTER."

 

  "YOU MEAN SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS? THAT WAS, OF COURSE, YURI'S DREAM. ON
THE WHOLE, IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT HE TALKED US ALL INTO FOLLOWING THAT
DREAM. WE WOULD NEVER HAVE ATTEMPTED THE VOYAGE OTHERWISE. NOR DOES THE
FAILURE OF THE DREAM DIM OUR FEAT. HAD WE FAILED TO RETURN ALIVE, WE CAN
BE SURE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH CRITICISM OF OUR FOLLY IN
ATTEMPTING THE MATTER. AS IT IS, THOUGH, WE ARE THE FIRST TO HAVE
ENTERED A LIVING HUMAN BODY AND TO HAVE RETURNED ALIVE -- A SOVIET FIRST
THAT WILL STAND FOREVER IN HISTORY. THERE WILL BE NO NON-SOVIET FEAT OF
THE SORT FOR YEARS AND OUR SOVIET LEADERSHIP IS WELL-AWARE OF THAT AND
VERY SATISFIED. WE ARE ASSURED OF THE MONEY WE WILL NEED FOR A
CONSIDERABLE TIME, I IMAGINE, PROVIDED WE CAN COME UP WITH A SPECTACULAR
FEAT NOW AND THEN."

 

  SHE SMILED BROADLY AT THIS AND MORRISON NODDED AND SMILED POLITELY
WITH HER. HE CUT AWAY AT THE HAM OMELET HE HAD REQUESTED AND SAID,
"WOULD IT HAVE BEEN DIPLOMATIC TO EMPHASIZE THAT AN AMERICAN WAS ONE OF
THE CREW? WAS I MENTIONED AT ALL?"

 

  "COME, ALBERT, DON'T THINK SO ILL OF US. YOUR FEAT IN TURNING THE SHIP
BY HAND AT THE RISK OF YOUR LIFE WAS MENTIONED WITH EMPHASIS."

 

  "AND SHAPIROV'S DEATH? THAT WILL NOT BE BLAMED ON US, I HOPE?"

 

  "THE DEATH IS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEEN UNAVOIDABLE. IT IS WELL-KNOWN
THAT HE WAS KEPT ALIVE AS LONG AS HE WAS BY ADVANCED MEDICAL METHODS
ONLY. I DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE MENTIONED TO ANY GREAT EXTENT IN THE
RECORDS."

 

  "IN ANY CASE," SAID MORRISON, "THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER."

 

  "THE NIGHTMARE? COME, GIVE YOURSELF A MONTH OR TWO AND IT WILL SEEM AN
EXCITING EPISODE THAT YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU EXPERIENCED."

 

  "I DOUBT IT."

 

  "YOU'LL SEE. IF YOU LIVE TO WITNESS OTHER SUCH VOYAGES, YOU'LL BE
DELIGHTED TO SAY, 'AH, BUT I WAS ON THE VERY FIRST,' AND YOU'LL NEVER
TIRE OF TELLING THE STORY TO YOUR GRANDCHILDREN."

 

  THAT'S THE OPENING, THOUGHT MORRISON. ALOUD, HE SAID, "I SEE YOU
ASSUME THAT I WILL SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN SOMEDAY. WHAT HAPPENS TO ME ONCE
WE'RE FINISHED WITH BREAKFAST, NATALYA?"

 

  "IT WILL BE OUT OF THE GROTTO FOR YOU AND BACK TO THE HOTEL."

 

  "NO NO, NATALYA. I WANT MORE THAN THAT. WHAT FOLLOWS THAT? I WARN YOU
THAT IF THE MINIATURIZATION PROJECT IS GOING TO GO PUBLIC AND IF THERE'S
A PARADE IN RED SQUARE, I DON'T INTEND TO BE PART OF IT."

 

  "PARADES ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION, ALBERT. WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM GOING
PUBLIC, ALTHOUGH WE'RE CLOSER TO IT BY FAR THAN WE WERE THE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY. "

 

  "LET ME PUT IT BALDLY THEN. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.
NOW."

 

  "AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, CERTAINLY. I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE PRESSURE FROM
YOUR GOVERNMENT."

 

  "I SHOULD HOPE SO," SAID MORRISON DRYLY.

 

  "THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO HAVE YOU BACK BEFORE YOU HAD A
CHANCE TO HELP US OR" -- HER EYES LOOKED INTO HIS RATHER STERNLY --
"FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, SPIED ON US. BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE YOUR
PART -- AND I'M SURE THEY WILL BE AWARE OF THAT SOMEHOW -- THEY WILL
DEMAND YOU BACK."

 

  "AND YOU MUST SEND ME BACK. YOU PROMISED THAT OVER AND OVER."

 

  "WE WILL KEEP OUR PROMISE."

 

  "NOR NEED YOU THINK I HAVE SPIED ON YOU, I HAVE SEEN NOTHING YOU HAVE
NOT LET ME SEE."

 

  "I KNOW THAT. YET, WHEN YOU RETURN TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY, DO YOU IMAGINE
THAT YOU WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED EXHAUSTIVELY ON WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN?"

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "THAT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE YOU MUST HAVE ACCEPTED
WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME HERE."

 

  "TRUE AND WE WON'T LET IT KEEP US FROM RETURNING YOU. IT IS QUITE
CERTAIN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOUR PEOPLE ANYTHING THEY DON'T
ALREADY KNOW. THEY POKE THEIR NOSES INTO OUR AFFAIRS CAREFULLY AND
SKILLFULLY --"

 

  "AS YOUR PEOPLE POKE THEIR NOSES INTO OURS --" SAID MORRISON WITH SOME
INDIGNATION.

 

  "UNDOUBTEDLY," SAID BORANOVA WITH A NEGLIGENT WAVE OF HER HAND. "OF
COURSE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM OF OUR SUCCESS, BUT WE DON'T
REALLY OBJECT TO THEIR KNOWING. TO THIS DAY, AMERICANS INSIST ON
BELIEVING THAT SOVIET SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS SECOND-CLASS. IT WILL DO
US GOOD TO TEACH THEM A LESSON IN THIS. ONE THING, THOUGH --"

 

  "AH," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "NOT A LARGE THING, BUT A LIE. YOU MUST NOT SAY WE BROUGHT YOU HERE BY
FORCE. IN ANY PUBLIC MENTION OF THIS MATTER, YOU MUST STATE -- IF THE
QUESTION ARISES -- THAT YOU CAME HERE VOLUNTARILY, IN ORDER TO TEST YOUR
THEORIES UNDER CONDITIONS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IT IS A TOTALLY LIKELY THING. WHO WOULD DISBELIEVE YOU?"

 

  "MY GOVERNMENT KNOWS OTHERWISE."

 

  "YES, BUT THEY WILL THEMSELVES URGE YOU TO TELL THE LIE. THEY ARE AS
LITTLE EAGER AS WE ARE TO PLUNGE THE WORLD INTO A CRISIS OVER THIS.
ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT CRISES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET
UNION WOULD INSTANTLY ANTAGONIZE THE REST OF THE WORLD AGAINST BOTH OF
US IN THESE SO-CALLED GOOD NEW DAYS, THE UNITED STATES WILL NO MORE WISH
TO ADMIT THEY HAD LET YOU BE TAKEN THAN WE WOULD TO ADMIT WE HAD TAKEN
YOU. COME, ALBERT, IT IS A SMALL THING."

 

  MORRISON SIGHED. "IF YOU RETURN ME NOW, AS YOU SAY YOU WILL DO, I WILL
KEEP QUIET ABOUT THIS SMALL MATTER OF KIDNAPPING."

 

  "YOU USE THE CONDITIONAL. YOU SAY 'IF.'" BORANOVA WAS GRIM. "YOU
CLEARLY FIND IT TROUBLESOME TO BELIEVE ME TO BE A PERSON OF HONOR. WHY?
BECAUSE I AM A SOVIET. TWO GENERATIONS OF PEACE, TWO GENERATIONS OF
GETTING ALONG, AND YOUR OLD HABITS PERSIST. IS THERE TO BE NO HOPE FOR
HUMANITY?"

 

  "GOOD NEW DAYS OR NOT, WE STILL DON'T LIKE YOUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT."

 

  "WHO GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO JUDGE US? WE DON'T LIKE YOURS, EITHER. --
BUT NEVER MIND. IF WE BEGIN TO QUARREL, THAT WILL SPOIL WHAT SHOULD BE A
HAPPY DAY FOR YOU -- AND WHAT IS A HAPPY DAY FOR ME."

 

  "VERY WELL. WE WILL NOT QUARREL."

 

  "THEN LET US SAY GOOD-BYE NOW, ALBERT, AND SOMEDAY WE WILL MEET AGAIN
UNDER MORE NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES I AM SURE." SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM
AND HE TOOK IT. SHE WENT ON, "I HAVE ASKED SOPHIA TO ESCORT YOU BACK TO
THE HOTEL AND TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUR LEAVING. YOU WILL NOT
OBJECT TO THAT, I'M SURE."

 

  MORRISON PRESSED HER HAND STRONGLY. "NO. I RATHER LIKE SOPHIA."

 

  BORANOVA SMILED. "I HAD SENSED THAT SOMEHOW."

 

  80.

 

  IT WAS A HAPPY DAY FOR BORANOVA AND HER EXHAUSTION DID NOT PREVENT HER
FROM ENJOYING IT.

 

  EXHAUSTION! HOW MANY DAYS OF REST, HOW MANY NIGHTS OF SLEEP, HOW LONG
A STRETCH AT HOME WITH NIKOLAI AND ALEKSANDR WOULD IT TAKE TO CURE THAT?

 

  BUT SHE WAS ALONE NOW AND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THERE WOULD BE NOTHING
TO DO. SEIZE THE MOMENT!

 

  BORANOVA STRETCHED OUT LUXURIOUSLY ON THE COUCH IN HER OFFICE AND GAVE
HERSELF OVER TO A CURIOUS JUMBLE OF THOUGHT -- NOW A COMMENDATION FROM
MOSCOW, WITH A PROMOTION, ALL MIXED UP WITH DAYS ON THE BEACH AT CRIMEA
WITH HER HUSBAND AND SON. IT BECAME ALMOST REAL AS SHE SLEPT AND DREAMED
THAT SHE WAS PURSUING LITTLE ALEKSANDR AS HE MARCHED FIRMLY INTO THE
COLD WATERS OF THE BLACK SEA IN HEEDLESS LACK OF CONCERN OVER THE
POSSIBILITY OF DROWNING HIMSELF. SHE WAS CARRYING A DRUM THAT SHE WAS
BEATING WILDLY IN ORDER TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION HE STUBBORNLY REFUSED
TO GIVE HER.

 

  AND THE VISION BROKE APART AND FADED AND THE DRUMBEAT WAS A HAMMERING
AT THE DOOR.

 

  SHE ROSE WITH A CONFUSED EFFORT, SMOOTHED THE BLOUSE SHE WAS WEARING,
AND STRODE TO THE DOOR IN HASTY CONCERN. THIS TURNED TO FURY WHEN SHE
THREW IT OPEN AND FOUND KONEV FROWNING DARKLY, HIS FIST RAISED TO RENEW
HIS ASSAULT.

 

  "WHAT IS THIS, YURI?" SHE SAID INDIGNANTLY. "IS THIS YOUR WAY OF
ANNOUNCING YOURSELF? THERE ARE SIGNALS."

 

  "WHICH NO ONE ANSWERED, THOUGH I KNEW YOU TO BE WITHIN."

 

  BORANOVA MOTIONED HIM IN WITH A QUICK GESTURE OF HER HEAD. SHE WAS NOT
ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM AND HE WAS NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT.

 

  SHE SAID, "HAVEN'T YOU SLEPT AT ALL? YOU LOOK AWFUL."

 

  "I HAVEN'T HAD TIME. I'VE BEEN WORKING."

 

  "AT WHAT?"

 

  "AT WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE, NATALYA? AT THE DATA WE OBTAINED YESTERDAY IN
THE BRAIN."

 

  BORANOVA FELT HER ANGER SEEP AWAY. AFTER ALL, IT WAS KONEV WHOSE DREAM
THIS HAD BEEN. THE SUCCESS OF SURVIVAL WAS SWEET FOR EVERYONE BUT KONEV.
ONLY HE FELT THE FAILURE.

 

  SHE SAID, "SIT DOWN, YURI. TRY TO FACE IT. THE THOUGHT ANALYSIS DIDN'T
WORK -- AND IT COULDN'T. SHAPIROV WAS TOO FAR GONE. EVEN AS WE WENT IN,
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH."

 

  KONEV LOOKED AT BORANOVA BLANKLY, AS THOUGH TOTALLY DISREGARDING HER
WORDS. "WHERE IS ALBERT MORRISON?"

 

  "THERE'S NO USE IN HOUNDING HIM, YURI. HE DID WHAT HE COULD, BUT
SHAPIROV'S WAS A DYING BRAIN. -- LISTEN TO ME. IT WAS A DYING BRAIN."

 

  AGAIN THAT BLANK LOOK. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NATALYA?"

 

  "THE DATA WE GOT. THE SUPPOSED DATA THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH. LET
IT GO. THE VOYAGE HAS BEEN A MARVELOUS SUCCESS EVEN WITHOUT IT."

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD. "A MARVELOUS SUCCESS WITHOUT IT? YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WHERE IS MORRISON?"

 

  "HE'S GONE, YURI. IT'S FINISHED. HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES. AS WE PROMISED."

 

  KONEV'S EYES OPENED WIDE. "BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HE CAN'T GO. HE
MUSTN'T GO."

 

  "WELL, NOW," SAID BORANOVA CALMLY. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"

 

  KONEV ROSE TO HIS FEET. "I WENT OVER THE DATA, YOU STUPID WOMAN, AND
IT'S ALL PLAIN. WE MUST KEEP MORRISON. AT ALL COSTS, WE MUST KEEP HIM."

 

  BORANOVA'S FACE REDDENED. "HOW DARE YOU INSULT ME, YURI? EXPLAIN
YOURSELF AT ONCE OR I WILL HAVE YOU SUSPENDED FROM THIS PROJECT. WHAT IS
THIS NEW MAD FIXATION OF YOURS ON ALBERT?"

 

  KONEV LIFTED HIS HANDS HALFWAY UPWARD, AS THOUGH IMPELLED BY AN
OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO STRIKE OUT AT SOMETHING, WITH NOTHING PRESENT TO
STRIKE AT.

 

  HE GASPED, "I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. I WITHDRAW THE ADJECTIVE. BUT YOU
MUST UNDERSTAND. ALL THROUGH OUR STAY IN THE BRAIN -- ALL THE TIME WE
WERE TRYING TO TAP SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS -- ALBERT MORRISON WAS LYING TO
US. HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN AND HE CAREFULLY LED
US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE MUST HAVE HIM, NATALYA, AND WE MUST HAVE
HIS DEVICE. WE CAN NEVER LET HIM GO."

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 18 -- RETURN

 

  94.

 

  THE TROUBLE WITH TRIUMPH IS THAT YOU MAY BE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  81.

 

  MORRISON WAS DOING HIS BEST TO KEEP HIS FEELINGS UNDER CONTROL. THERE
WAS A NATURAL ELATION. HE WAS GOING TO GO HOME. HE WAS GOING TO BE FREE.
HE WAS GOING TO BE SAFE. MUCH MORE THAN THAT, HE WOULD --

 

  BUT HE DARED NOT THINK OF THAT CLIMACTIC BIT AS YET. YURI KONEV WAS
FEARFULLY INTELLIGENT AND ALREADY SUSPICIOUS. MORRISON'S THOUGHTS, IF
KONEV CONCENTRATED ON THEM, MIGHT GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY IN HIS FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS SOMEHOW.

 

  -- OR WERE THEY JUST PLAYING WITH HIM? THAT WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
COIN.

 

  WERE THEY PLANNING TO BREAK HIS SPIRIT AND TURN HIM TO THEIR OWN USES?
IT WAS AN OLD TRICK, TO RAISE HOPES AND THEN DASH THEM -- FAR WORSE THAN
HAVING NO HOPE AT ALL AT ANY TIME.

 

  WOULD NATALYA BORANOVA DO SUCH A THING? SHE HAD NOT HESITATED TO TAKE
HIM FORCIBLY WHEN HE WOULD NOT COME WILLINGLY. SHE HAD NOT HESITATED TO
THREATEN TO DESTROY HIS REPUTATION FOREVER TO GET HIM ON THE SHIP. HOW
MUCH FARTHER WOULD SHE GO? WOULD SHE STOP AT NOTHING?

 

  HIS HEART BOUNDED WITH A MARKED RELIEF WHEN SOPHIA KALIININ APPEARED.
SURELY SHE WOULD NOT BE PARTY TO SUCH A DECEPTION.

 

  HE BELIEVED THAT EVEN MORE FIRMLY WHEN SHE SMILED AT HIM, LOOKING
HAPPIER THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN HER. SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND TUCKED IT UNDER
HER ARM.

 

  "YOU'LL BE GOING HOME NOW. I'M SO GLAD FOR YOU," SHE SAID AND MORRISON
COULD NOT MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE THAT THOSE WORDS -- THEIR INTONATION, HER
EXPRESSION -- WERE ALL PART OF A CAREFUL LIE.

 

  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAID CAUTIOUSLY, "I HOPE I'M GOING HOME."

 

  AND SHE SAID, "YOU ARE. -- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON A SKIMMER?"

 

  FOR A MOMENT, MORRISON STUMBLED ON THE RUSSIAN WORD, THEN USED A
TRANSLATED ENGLISH PHRASE. "DO YOU MEAN AN SPF -- A SOLAR-POWERED
FLYER?"

 

  "THIS IS A SOVIET DESIGN. MUCH BETTER. IT HAS LIGHT ENGINES. YOU CAN'T
ALWAYS TRUST THE SUN."

 

  "BUT WHY A SKIMMER, THEN?" THEY WERE MOVING BRISKLY TOWARD THE
PASSAGEWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM OUT OF THE GROTTO.

 

  "WHY NOT? WE'LL BE AT MALENKIGRAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND SINCE YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN IN A SOVIET SKIMMER, YOU'LL LOVE IT. IT WILL BE ONE MORE WAY
OF CELEBRATING YOUR RETURN."

 

  "I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS OF HEIGHTS. WILL IT BE SAFE?"

 

  "ABSOLUTELY. BESIDES, I COULDN'T RESIST. WE'RE IN A WONDERFUL
SITUATION NOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER IT WILL LAST. WHATEVER WE
WANT WE GETFOR THE MOMENT. I SAID, 'A SKIMMER IS WHAT WE WILL WANT,' AND
THEY SMILED ALL OVER THEIR FACES AND SAID, 'WHY, CERTAINLY, DR.
KALIININ. IT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU.' DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, I WOULD
HAVE HAD TO FILL OUT A PROOF-OF-NEED FORM FOR A PLATE OF BORSCHT. TODAY
I AM A HERO OF THE SOVIET UNION -- UNOFFICIALLY, AS YET. WE ALL ARE.
YOU, TOO, ALBERT."

 

  "I HOPE I WON'T BE EXPECTED TO STAY FOR THE OFFICIAL CEREMONIES," SAID
MORRISON, STILL CAUTIOUS.

 

  "THE OFFICIAL CEREMONIES WILL BE CONFINED TO THE GROTTO, OF COURSE,
AND WON'T BE ELABORATE AT ALL. YOUR SCROLL WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE FORWARDED
TO YOU. PERHAPS OUR AMBASSADOR CAN GIVE IT TO YOU IN A QUIET WASHINGTON
CEREMONY."

 

  "NOT NECESSARY," SAID MORRISON. "I WOULD APPRECIATE THE HONOR, BUT
GETTING IT IN THE MAIL IS ALL I REALLY WANT."

 

  THEY HAD TURNED DOWN A CORRIDOR THAT MORRISON HAD NOT TAKEN BEFORE AND
THEN WALKED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM WONDER UNEASILY WHERE THEY MIGHT BE
GOING. NO NEED TO HAVE WORRIED, MORRISON THOUGHT AS THEY EMERGED INTO A
SMALL AIRFIELD.

 

  THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE SKIMMER. IT HAD LONG WINGS, GLITTERING WITH
A LAYER OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS ALONG THEIR ENTIRE UPPER SURFACE, VERY
MUCH AS AMERICAN SPFS HAD. THE AMERICAN PLANES, HOWEVER, RELIED ON THE
SOLAR PANELS ENTIRELY. THE SKIMMER HE SAW HAD SMALL ROTORS --
GASOLINE-POWERED, NO DOUBT -- AS ASSISTS. KALIININ MIGHT PRESENT THAT AS
A SOVIET IMPROVEMENT BUT MORRISON SUSPECTED THAT THE SOVIET PHOTOVOLTAIC
CELLS WERE NOT AS EFFICIENT AS THE AMERICAN ONES.

 

  A MECHANIC WAS STANDING NEAR THE SKIMMER AND KALIININ APPROACHED HIM
WITH LONG, CONFIDENT STRIDES. "HOW DOES IT TEST OUT?"

 

  "SWEET AS A DREAM," SAID THE MECHANIC.

 

  SHE SMILED AND NODDED, BUT AS HE STEPPED AWAY SHE MUTTERED TO
MORRISON, "I'LL CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY, OF COURSE. I'VE SEEN DREAMS THAT
TURNED INTO NIGHTMARES."

 

  MORRISON STUDIED THE SKIMMER WITH A MIXTURE OF INTEREST AND
APPREHENSION. IT LOOKED LIKE THE SKELETON OF A PLANE, WITH EVERYTHING
SOMEHOW THINNER AND LONGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. THE COCKPIT WAS TINY, LIKE
A SOAP BUBBLE UNDER THE HUGE FLAP OF WINGS AND THE LONG BACKWARD
EXTENSION OF A THIN SKELETAL STRUCTURE.

 

  KALIININ HAD TO BEND HERSELF NEARLY DOUBLE TO CLIMB IN. MORRISON
WATCHED HER AS SHE FIDDLED WITH THE CONTROLS. THEN, AFTER WHAT SEEMED A
CONSIDERABLE LAPSE OF TIME, SHE TAXIED IT DOWN THE FIELD, TURNED IT, AND
CAME BACK. SHE RAISED THE ROTOS AND LET THEM TURN SLOWLY AND EVENTUALLY
EVERYTHING WAS SHUT DOWN AND SHE GOT OUT.

 

  "IT'S WORKING NICELY," SHE SAID. "THE FUEL SUPPLY IS ADEQUATE AND THE
SUN IS SHINING BRILLIANTLY. ONE COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE."

 

  MORRISON NODDED AND LOOKED AROUND. "ONE COULD ASK FOR THE PILOT. WHERE
IS HE?"

 

  KALIININ FROZE AT ONCE. "WHERE IS HE? IS THERE SOME SEXUAL REQUIREMENT
FOR THE TASK? I PILOT MY OWN SKIMMER."

 

  "YOU?" EXCLAIMED MORRISON QUITE AUTOMATICALLY.

 

  "YES, I! WHY NOT? I HAVE MY LICENSE AND I QUALIFY AS A MASTER PILOT.
GET IN!"

 

  "I'M SORRY," STAMMERED MORRISON. "I -- I RARELY FLY AND PILOTING
ANYTHING THROUGH THE AIR IS ALMOST A MYSTICAL THING TO ME. I JUST
ASSUMED THAT A PILOT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT PILOTING AND THAT IF SOMEONE
DID ANYTHING ELSE, HE COULDN'T BE A PILOT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"

 

  "I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT, ALBERT. GET IN."

 

  MORRISON CLIMBED IN, FOLLOWING HER DIRECTIONS AND DOING HIS BEST NOT
TO DAMAGE HIS HEAD ON ANY PORTION OF THE SKIMMER -- OR, PERHAPS,
DAMAGING THE SKIMMER.

 

  HE SAT IN HIS SEAT, STARING IN HORROR AT THE SKIMMER'S OPEN SIDE TO
HIS RIGHT. "ISN'T THERE A DOOR TO CLOSE?"

 

  "WHY DO YOU WANT A CLOSED DOOR? IT WOULD SPOIL THE WONDERFUL FEELING
OF FLIGHT. STRAP YOURSELF IN AND YOU'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE. -- HERE, I'LL
SHOW YOU HOW. -- ARE YOU READY NOW?" SHE WAS IN THE SEAT BESIDE HIM,
LOOKING QUITE CONFIDENT AND PLEASED WITH HERSELF. THEY WERE CROWDED INTO
CONTACT AND THAT MUCH AT LEAST MORRISON FOUND RATHER SOOTHING.

 

  "I'M RESIGNED," HE SAID. "THAT'S AS CLOSE AS I CAN GET TO READY."

 

  "DON'T BE SILLY. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. WE'LL USE THE MOTORS TO
RISE."

 

  THERE WAS A HIGH-PITCHED THROB OF THE SMALL ENGINE AND A RHYTHMIC SLAP
AS THE ROTORS BEGAN TO SPIN. SLOWLY THE SKIMMER ROSE AND -- AS SLOWLY --
IT TURNED. IT CANTED TO ONE SIDE WHILE TURNING AND MORRISON FOUND
HIMSELF LEANING OUT OVER THE OPEN SIDE AND STRAINING PRECARIOUSLY
AGAINST THE STRAP THAT HELD HIM. HE BARELY MANAGED TO FIGHT OFF THE
STRONG IMPULSE TO THROW HIS ARMS AROUND KALIININ FOR NOTHING MORE THAN
UTTERLY NONEROTIC SECURITY.

 

  THE SKIMMER STRAIGHTENED AND KALIININ SAID, "NOW, LISTEN," AS SHE
TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND THREW IN A SWITCH LABELED, IN CYRILLIC, SOLAR.
THE THROB CEASED AND THE ROTORS SLACKENED AS THE FORWARD PROPELLER BEGAN
TO TURN. THE SKIMMER MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST SILENTLY FORWARD.

 

  "LISTEN TO THE QUIET," WHISPERED KALIININ. "IT'S LIKE DRIFTING ON
NOTHING."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED DOWN UNEASILY.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "WE WON'T FALL. EVEN IF A CLOUD PASSED OVER THE SUN OR
IF A CIRCUIT FAILURE PUT THE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS OUT OF ACTION, THERE IS
ENOUGH POWER IN THE STORAGE COMPONENTS TO BRING US ACROSS KILOMETERS, IF
NECESSARY, TO A SAFE LANDING. AND IF WE RAN OUT OF POWER, THE SKIMMER IS
MORE THAN HALF A GLIDER AND IT WOULD STILL SETTLE DOWN TO A SAFE
LANDING. I DON'T THINK I COULD FORCE THE CRAFT INTO A CRASH EVEN IF I
TRIED. THE ONLY REAL DANGER IS A STRONG WIND AND THERE'S NONE OF THAT
NOW."

 

  MORRISON SWALLOWED AND SAID, "IT'S A GENTLE MOTION."

 

  "OF COURSE. WE'RE NOT GOING MUCH FASTER THAN AN AUTOMOBILE WOULD GO
AND THE SENSATION IS MUCH PLEASANTER. I LOVE IT. TRY TO RELAX AND LOOK
AT THE SKY. THERE'S NOTHING AS PEACEFUL AS A SKIMMER."

 

  HE SAID, "HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?"

 

  "WHEN I WAS TWENTY-FOUR, I GOT MY MASTER'S LICENSE. SO DID YU-- SO DID
HE. MANY A PEACEFUL SUMMER AFTERNOON WE SPENT IN THE AIR IN A SKIMMER
LIKE THIS. ONCE WE EACH HAD A RACING SKIMMER AND MARKED OUT LOVER'S
KNOTS IN THE AIR." HER FACE TWISTED SLIGHTLY AS SHE SAID THAT AND IT
OCCURRED TO MORRISON THAT SHE HAD OBTAINED A SKIMMER FOR THE SHORT HOP
TO MALENKIGRAD ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF A MOMENTARY RELIVING OF MEMORIES AND
FOR NO OTHER REASON.

 

  "THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS," HE SAID.

 

  "NOT REALLY -- IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. ONCE WE SKIMMED ALONG
THE FOOTHILLS OF THE CAUCASUS AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS. A WIND
SQUALL CAN EASILY SMASH YOU INTO A HILLSIDE AND THAT WOULDN'T BE FUN AT
ALL, BUT WE WERE YOUNG AND CAREFREE. -- THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER
OFF IF THAT HAD HAPPENED."

 

  HER VOICE TRAILED AWAY AND FOR A MOMENT HER FACE DARKENED, BUT THEN AN
INNER THOUGHT SEEMED TO ILLUMINATE HER INTO A SMILE.

 

  MORRISON FELT HIS DISTRUST MOUNTING AGAIN. WHY DID THE THOUGHT OF
KONEV MAKE HER SO HAPPY, WHEN SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM WHEN
THEY WERE TOGETHER IN THE MINIATURIZED SHIP?

 

  MORRISON SAID, "YOU DON'T SEEM TO MIND TALKING ABOUT HIM, SOPHIA."
THEN, DELIBERATELY, HE USED THE FORBIDDEN WORD, "ABOUT YURI, I MEAN. IT
EVEN SEEMS TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. WHY IS THAT?"

 

  AND KALIININ SAID BETWEEN HER TEETH, "IT'S NOT SENTIMENTAL MEMORIES
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY, I ASSURE YOU, ALBERT. ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND --
AND HEARTBREAK CAN MAKE A PERSON VICIOUS. I WANT REVENGE AND I AM
MEAN-SPIRITED ENOUGH -- WELL, HUMAN ENOUGH -- TO ENJOY IT WHEN IT
COMES."

 

  "REVENGE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND."

 

  "IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, ALBERT. HE DEPRIVED ME OF LOVE AND MY DAUGHTER OF
A FATHER WHEN I HAD NO WAY OF STRIKING BACK. THAT DID NOT BOTHER HIM AS
LONG AS HE HAD HIS DREAM OF BRINGING MINIATURIZATION TO PRACTICAL
LOW-ENERGY FRUITION SO THAT HE MIGHT BECOME, AT A BOUND, THE MOST FAMOUS
SCIENTIST IN THE WORLD -- OR IN HISTORY."

 

  "BUT HE FAILED AT THAT. WE DIDN'T GET THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FROM
SHAPIROV'S BRAIN. YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T."

 

  "AH, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. HE NEVER GIVES UP; HE'S DRIVEN BY THE
FURIES. I'VE SEEN HIM, FLEETINGLY, LOOKING AT YOU, AFTER THE VOYAGE
THROUGH SHAPIROV'S BODY WAS DONE. I KNOW HIS LOOKS, ALBERT. I CAN TELL
HIS THOUGHTS EVEN FROM THE DROOP OF AN EYELID. HE THINKS YOU HAVE THE
ANSWER."

 

  "OF WHAT WAS IN SHAPIROV'S BRAIN? I DON'T. HOW COULD I?"

 

  "IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT, ALBERT. HE THINKS YOU DO AND
HE WANTS YOU AND YOUR DEVICE WITH A GREATER YEARNING THAN HE EVER WANTED
ANYTHING IN HIS LIFE; CERTAINLY MORE THAN HE WANTED ME OR HIS CHILD. AND
I'M TAKING YOU AWAY FROM HIM, ALBERT. WITH MY OWN HANDS I AM TAKING YOU
OUT OF THE GROTTO AND WILL WATCH YOU LEAVE FOR YOUR OWN COUNTRY. AND I
WILL SEE HIM SICKEN TO DEATH OF FRUSTRATED AMBITION."

 

  MORRISON STARED AT HER IN ASTONISHMENT AS THE SKIMMER MOVED ALONG IN
RESPONSE TO HER ROCK-STEADY HAND AT THE CONTROLS. HE HAD NOT THOUGHT
THAT KALIININ WAS CAPABLE OF WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF SUCH CONSUMING AND
MALIGNANT JOY.

 

  82.

 

  BORANOVA HAD LISTENED TO KONEV'S EMOTIONAL AND BREATHLESS ACCOUNT AND
FELT HERSELF CARRIED ALONG BY THE WAVE OF HIS UTTER CONVICTION. THAT HAD
HAPPENED BEFORE, WHEN HE HAD BEEN CONVINCED THAT SHAPIROV'S DYING MIND
COULD BE TAPPED AND THAT MORRISON, THE AMERICAN NEUROPHYSICIST, WAS THE
KEY TO DOING THAT. SHE HAD BEEN SWEPT ALONG THEN AND SHE TRIED TO RESIST
IT NOW.

 

  SHE SAID FINALLY, "THAT SOUNDS QUITE MAD."

 

  KONEV SAID, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IF IT'S TRUE?"

 

  "AH, BUT IS IT TRUE?"

 

  "I AM CERTAIN."

 

  BORANOVA MUTTERED, "WE NEED ARKADY HERE TO TELL US THAT HIS FATHER
ASSURED HIM THAT VEHEMENCE WAS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH."

 

  "NEITHER IS IT A GUARANTEE OF THE REVERSE. IF YOU ACCEPT WHAT I SAY,
YOU MUST ALSO SEE THAT WE CAN'T LET HIM GO. CERTAINLY NOT NOW AND
POSSIBLY NOT EVER."

 

  BORANOVA SHOOK HER HEAD VIOLENTLY. "IT'S TOO LATE. THERE'S NOTHING TO
BE DONE. THE UNITED STATES WANTS HIM BACK AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED
TO LET HIM GO. THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T VERY WELL BACKTRACK NOW WITHOUT
BRINGING ABOUT A WORLD CRISIS."

 

  "CONSIDERING WHAT IS AT STAKE, NATALYA, WE MUST SURELY RISK IT. THE
WORLD CRISIS WILL NOT EXPLODE. THERE WILL BE LOUD TALK AND MUCH
POSTURING FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND THEN IF WE HAVE WHAT WE WANT, WE MIGHT
LET HIM GO IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- OR WE MIGHT ARRANGE AN ACCIDENT
--"

 

  BORANOVA ROSE TO HER FEET ANGRILY. "NO! WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS
UNTHINKABLE. THIS IS THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, NOT THE TWENTIETH."

 

  "NATALYA, WHATEVER CENTURY THIS IS, WE FACE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
THE UNIVERSE IS TO BE OURS -- OR THEIRS."

 

  "YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONVINCE MOSCOW THAT THAT IS WHAT IS AT
STAKE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS WHAT IT WANTS, A SAFE VOYAGE INTO AND OUT OF A
BODY. AT THE MOMENT IT'S ALL THEY WANT. THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT WE
WANTED TO READ SHAPIROV'S MIND. WE NEVER EXPLAINED THAT."

 

  "THAT WAS A MISTAKE."

 

  "COME, YURI. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO PERSUADE THEM
THAT ALBERT WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN FORCIBLY IF HE DID NOT COME
VOLUNTARILY? THEY WOULD NOT HAVE WANTED TO RISK A CRISIS -- EVEN AS MUCH
A CRISIS AS THEY NOW FACE, WHICH IS A MINOR ONE INDEED. YOU WILL NOW BE
ASKING THEM TO FACE A MUCH LARGER ONE. NOT ONLY WILL YOU FAIL BUT YOU
WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER OF THE ARRIVAL OF ALBERT
HERE AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD THAT."

 

  "THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALL ONE PIECE. THERE ARE MANY HIGH OFFICIALS
WHO ARE CONVINCED THAT WE ARE TOO EAGER TO GIVE IN TO THE AMERICANS,
THAT WE PAY TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR THE OCCASIONAL PAT ON THE HEAD WE
RECEIVE. I HAVE PEOPLE TO WHOM I HAVE ENTRY --"

 

  "I HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT YOU HAVE. THAT'S A DANGEROUS GAME YOU PLAY,
YURI. BETTER MEN THAN YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THAT SORT OF INTRIGUE
AND HAVE COME TO DEPLORABLE ENDS."

 

  "IT'S THE CHANCE I MUST TAKE. IN A CASE LIKE THIS, I CAN TURN THE
GOVERNMENT AROUND. BUT WE MUST HAVE ALBERT MORRISON IN OUR OWN HANDS IF
WE'RE TO DO IT. ONCE HE'S GONE, IT WILL BE ALL OVER. -- WHEN IS HE
SUPPOSED TO BE LEAVING?"

 

  "NIGHTFALL. SOPHIA AND I AGREED THAT, FOR THE SAKE OF AVOIDING
OBTRUSIVENESS AND OF NEEDLESSLY PROVOKING THOSE WHO TEND TO BE AGAINST
ACCOMMODATION WITH THE AMERICANS, NIGHT IS BETTER THAN DAY."

 

  HE STARED AT HER, EYES OPENING WIDELY ENOUGH SO THAT THEY ALMOST
SEEMED PROTUBERANT. "SOPHIA?" HE SAID HARSHLY. "WHAT'S SHE GOT TO DO
WITH IT?"

 

  "SHE'S IN CHARGE OF THE DETAILS OF RETURNING ALBERT. SHE REQUESTED
IT."

 

  "SHE REQUESTED IT?"

 

  "YES. I IMAGINE SHE WISHED TO BE WITH HIM FOR AN ADDITIONAL WHILE."
WITH A TOUCH OF SPITE, SHE ADDED, "PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T NOTICE IT, BUT SHE
RATHER LIKES THE AMERICAN."

 

  KONEV SNEERED IN DISGUST. "NOT A BIT OF IT. I KNOW THAT DEVIL. I KNOW
HER IF I KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL -- EVERY THOUGHT IN HER HEAD. SHE'S
GETTING HIM AWAY FROM ME. SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM IN THE SHIP,
WATCHING HIS EVERY MOVE, SHE MUST HAVE GUESSED HIS IMPORTANCE AND SHE
MEANS TO DEPRIVE ME OF HIM. SHE WON'T WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL. SHE'LL HURRY
HIM OFF AT ONCE."

 

  HE ROSE AND LEFT THE ROOM AT A RUN.

 

  "YURI," BORANOVA CALLED AFTER HIM. "YURI, WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO?"

 

  "STOP HER," FLOATED BACK THE ANSWER.

 

  SHE GAZED AFTER HIM THOUGHTFULLY. SHE COULD STOP HIM. SHE HAD THE
AUTHORITY. SHE HAD THE MEANS. AND YET -- WHAT IF HE WAS RIGHT? WHAT IF
WHAT WAS AT STAKE WAS INDEED NOTHING LESS THAN THE UNIVERSE? IF SHE
STOPPED HIM, EVERYTHING -- EVERYTHING -- MIGHT BE HANDED OVER TO THE
AMERICANS. IF SHE LET HIM GO, THERE MIGHT BE A CRISIS OF AN INTENSITY
THAT HADN'T BEEN DREAMED OF IN GENERATIONS.

 

  SHE HAD TO COME TO A DECISION AT ONCE.

 

  SHE BEGAN AGAIN.

 

  IF SHE STOPPED HIM, SHE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING. IF HE THEN TURNED
OUT TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT, THE BLAME FOR HAVING STOPPED HIM AND HAVING LOST
THE UNIVERSE WOULD REST SQUARELY ON HER. IF HE TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG
AFTER BEING STOPPED -- HER ACTION WOULD BE FORGOTTEN. THERE IS NOTHING
DRAMATIC ABOUT A MISTAKE THAT IS NOT MADE.

 

  IF SHE DID NOTHING TO STOP HIM, HOWEVER, THEN ALL WAS ON KONEV'S HEAD.
IF HE SOMEHOW PREVENTED MORRISON'S RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AND IF
THE GOVERNMENT WERE THEN HUMILIATINGLY FORCED TO RELEASE HIM, IT WOULD
BE KONEV WHO WOULD BE BLAMED. BORANOVA WOULD LOSE NOTHING, FOR HE HAD
DASHED OFF WITHOUT TELLING HER WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AND SHE COULD
REASONABLY CLAIM SHE HAD NOT DREAMED HE WOULD TRY TO SUBVERT THE KNOWN
INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. SHE WOULD BE IN THE CLEAR. IF, ON THE OTHER
HAND, HE PREVENTED MORRISON'S RETURN AND PROVED TO BE RIGHT AND THE
GOVERNMENT WON THE BATTLE OF WILLS THAT FOLLOWED, SHE COULD CLAIM THE
CREDIT OF HAVING DONE NOTHING TO STOP HIM. SHE COULD SAY THAT IT HAD
BEEN WITH HER PERMISSION THAT HE HAD WORKED.

 

  WELL, THEN, IF SHE STOPPED HIM, THE WORST WAS BLAME, THE BEST WAS
NEUTRAL. IF SHE DID NOTHING, THE BEST WAS CREDIT, THE WORST WAS NEUTRAL.

 

  SO BORANOVA DID NOTHING.

 

  83.

 

  MORRISON DECIDED THAT KALIININ WAS RIGHT. AS THE MINUTES PASSED, HE
GREW LESS UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE SKIMMER AND EVEN BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE A
FEEBLE PLEASURE.

 

  HE COULD SEE THE GROUND CLEARLY THROUGH THE OPEN LATTICEWORK THAT MADE
UP THE CHASSIS OF THE CRAFT. IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY METERS BELOW (HE
JUDGED) AND MOVING SMOOTHLY BACKWARD.

 

  KALIININ SAT AT THE CONTROLS, COMPLETELY ABSORBED, THOUGH IT DIDN'T
SEEM TO MORRISON THAT SHE HAD MUCH TO DO. PRESUMABLY, IT WAS SKILL AND
PATIENT OBSERVATION THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO KEEP THE SKIMMER ON
TRACK WITHOUT MINUTE-BY-MINUTE ADJUSTMENT.

 

  HE SAID, "WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FIND YOURSELF MOVING INTO A HEADWIND,
SOPHIA?"

 

  SHE SAID WITHOUT TAKING HER EYES FROM THE CONTROLS, "THEN I WOULD HAVE
TO USE THE ENGINE AND WASTE FUEL. IF IT WERE A FRESH WIND, IT WOULDN'T
PAY TO USE A SKIMMER AT ALL. FORTUNATELY, TODAY IS IDEAL SKIMMER
WEATHER."

 

  MORRISON BEGAN TO FEEL SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST WELL-BEING FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE HAVING LEFT THE UNITED STATES -- NO, SINCE A
CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE THAT. HE BEGAN TO PICTURE HIMSELF
BACK IN THE UNITED STATES; IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO DO SO.

 

  HE ASKED, "WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE REACH THE HOTEL IN MALENKIGRAD?"

 

  "CAR TO AN AIRPORT," SAID KALIININ CRISPLY, "AND THEN YOU'LL BOARD A
PLANE TO AMERICA."

 

  "WHEN?"

 

  "TONIGHT, ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE. I'LL TRY TO GET IT DONE MORE
QUICKLY."

 

  MORRISON SAID WITH WHAT WAS ALMOST JOVIALITY, "ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF
ME?"

 

  AND TO HIS SURPRISE, THE ANSWER CAME BACK AT ONCE. "YES. EXACTLY."

 

  HE STUDIED HER FACE IN PROFILE. THE LOOK OF STUDIED HATRED HAD LONG
SINCE VANISHED, BUT THERE WAS A SETTLED ANXIETY ABOUT HER EXPRESSION
THAT CAUSED MORRISON TO QUIVER. THE PICTURE OF HIMSELF BACK IN THE
UNITED STATES BEGAN TO FADE AROUND THE EDGES.

 

  HE SAID, "IS ANYTHING WRONG, SOPHIA?"

 

  "NO, NOTHING WRONG NOW. IT'S JUST THAT I EXPECT THAT -- HE WILL COME
AFTER US. THE WOLF IS IN PURSUIT, SO I MUST GET YOU AWAY QUICKLY IF I
CAN."

 

  84.

 

  THE CITY OF MALENKIGRAD LAY BELOW THEM, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A
CITY. SMALL IN NAME, IT WAS SMALL IN FACT AND IT RAVELED OFF IN ALL
DIRECTIONS INTO THE FLAT COUNTRYSIDE.

 

  IT WAS THE BEDROOM COMMUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE WORKING ON THE
MINIATURIZATION PROJECT AND DURING THE DAY -- NOW -- IT SEEMED ALL BUT
DESERTED. THERE WAS A MOVING VEHICLE HERE AND THERE, OCCASIONALLY A
PEDESTRIAN, AND, OF COURSE, CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE DUSTY STREETS.

 

  IT OCCURRED TO MORRISON THAT HE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE, IN THE
MIGHTY STRETCH OF LAND THAT MADE UP THE SOVIET UNION, MALENKIGRAD AND
THE GROTTO MIGHT BE. IT WASN'T IN THE BIRCH FOREST OR IN THE TUNDRA. THE
EARLY SUMMER WAS WARM AND THE GROUND LOOKED SEMIARID. HE MIGHT BE IN
CENTRAL ASIA OR IN THE STEPPES NEAR THE EUROPEAN SIDE OF THE CASPIAN. HE
COULD NOT SAY.

 

  THE SKIMMER WAS DROPPING NOW, MORE GENTLY THAN AN ELEVATOR. MORRISON
WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT SO SOOTHING A DESCENT COULD BE POSSIBLE.
THEN THE WHEELS TOUCHED THE GROUND AND THEY BRAKED TO A NEARLY INSTANT
HALT. THEY WERE IN THE REAR OF THE HOTEL, A HOTEL THE SMALL SIZE OF
WHICH HE COULD APPRECIATE WHEN IT WAS SEEN FROM THE AIR.

 

  KALIININ LEFT THE SKIMMER WITH A LIVELY JUMP AND MOTIONED TO MORRISON,
WHO EMERGED MORE SEDATELY.

 

  HE SAID, "WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SKIMMER NOW?"

 

  SHE ANSWERED CARELESSLY, "I'LL PICK IT UP ON MY RETURN AND TAKE IT
BACK TO THE GROTTO FIELD IF THE WEATHER HOLDS. COME, LET'S GO AROUND TO
THE FRONT AND I'LL GET YOU INTO YOUR ROOM, WHERE YOU CAN REST A LITTLE
AND WHERE WE CAN PLAN THE NEXT STEP."

 

  "THE ROOM WITH THE SOLDIERS WATCHING ME, YOU MEAN."

 

  SHE SAID IMPATIENTLY, "THERE'LL BE NO SOLDIERS WATCHING YOU. WE'RE NOT
AFRAID OF YOUR TRYING TO ESCAPE NOW." THEN, WITH A QUICK GLANCE AROUND,
SHE ADDED, "THOUGH I'D RATHER HAVE THE SOLDIERS, ACTUALLY."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED ABOUT, TOO, A BIT ANXIOUSLY AND DECIDED HE'D RATHER
NOT HAVE THE SOLDIERS. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF KONEV CAME TO RECLAIM
HIM, AS KALIININ CLEARLY FEARED HE MIGHT DO, HE MIGHT EASILY COME WITH
SOLDIERS AT HIS BACK.

 

  AND THEN MORRISON THOUGHT: OR IS THIS REALLY SOMETHING TO FEAR? SHE
HAS A THING ABOUT YURI. SHE'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING OF HIM.

 

  THE THOUGHT DID NOT QUIET HIM, HOWEVER.

 

  MORRISON HAD NOT SEEN THE HOTEL IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM OUTSIDE; HE HAD
NOT HAD THE LEISURE TO STUDY IT IN ANY CASE. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT
WAS PROBABLY USED ONLY BY VISITING OFFICIALS AND SPECIAL GUESTS -- SUCH
AS HE HIMSELF, IF HE COULD LAY CLAIM TO THE CATEGORY. HE WONDERED IF,
SMALL AS IT WAS, IT WAS EVER FULL. CERTAINLY, THE TWO NIGHTS HE HAD
SPENT HERE HAD BEEN QUIET INDEED. HE RECALLED NO NOISE IN THE CORRIDORS
AND THE DINING ROOM, WHEN HE HAD EATEN THERE, HAD BEEN ALL BUT EMPTY,
TOO.

 

  IT WAS AT THE MOMENT HE THOUGHT OF THE DINING ROOM THAT THEY
APPROACHED THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND THERE, TO ONE SIDE, SITTING IN THE SUN
AND PORING OVER A BOOK, WAS A STOUTISH WOMAN WITH REDDISH-BROWN HAIR.
SHE WAS WEARING HALF-SPECTACLES, PERCHED LOW ON HER NOSE. (MORRISON WAS
SURPRISED AT THAT BIT OF ARCHAISM. IT WAS RARE TO SEE GLASSES IN THESE
DAYS WHEN EYE-MOLDING WAS ROUTINE AND NORMAL VISION HAD TRULY BECOME
NORMAL.)

 

  IT WAS THE GLASSES AND THE STUDIOUS LOOK ON HER FACE THAT CHANGED HER
APPEARANCE SO THAT MORRISON MIGHT EASILY NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED HER. HE
WOULD NOT HAVE, PERHAPS, IF HE HAD NOT JUST THOUGHT OF THE DINING ROOM.
THE WOMAN WAS THE WAITRESS TO WHOM HE HAD APPEALED FOR HELP THREE
EVENINGS BEFORE AND WHO HAD FAILED HIM -- VALERI PALERON.

 

  HE SAID AUSTERELY, "GOOD MORNING, COMRADE PALERON." HIS VOICE WAS
STIFF AND HIS EXPRESSION UNFRIENDLY.

 

  SHE DID NOT SEEM DISCOMFITED BY THIS. SHE LOOKED UP, REMOVED HER
GLASSES, AND SAID, "AH, COMRADE AMERICAN. YOU ARE BACK SAFE AND SOUND.
CONGRATULATIONS."

 

  "FOR WHAT?"

 

  "IT IS THE TALK OF THE TOWN. THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPERIMENT THAT WAS A
GREAT SUCCESS."

 

  KALIININ, HER FACE LIKE THUNDER, SAID SHARPLY, "THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE
TALK OF THE TOWN. WE NEED NO WAGGING TONGUES."

 

  "WHAT WAGGING TONGUES?" SAID THE WAITRESS WITH SPIRIT. "WHO HERE DOES
NOT WORK AT THE GROTTO OR HAVE A RELATIVE THERE? WHY SHOULD WE NOT KNOW
OF IT AND WHY SHOULD WE NOT SPEAK OF IT? AND CAN I FAIL TO HEAR? MUST I
STOP MY EARS? I CANNOT CARRY A TRAY AND PUT MY FINGERS IN MY EARS, TOO."

 

  SHE TURNED TO MORRISON. "I HEAR THAT YOU DID VERY WELL AND ARE GREATLY
PRAISED FOR IT."

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED.

 

  "AND THIS MAN," THE WAITRESS SAID, TURNING TO THE FROWNING AND
INCREASINGLY IMPATIENT KALIININ, "WISHED TO LEAVE BEFORE HE HAD THE
CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GREAT DEED. HE TURNED TO ME FOR HELP IN HIS
SCHEME TO LEAVE -- TO ME, A WAITRESS. I REPORTED HIM AT ONCE, OF COURSE,
AND THAT MADE HIM UNHAPPY. EVEN NOW, SEE HOW HE GLARES AT ME." SHE
WAGGED HER FINGER AT HIM. "BUT CONSIDER THE FAVOR I DID YOU. HAD I NOT
PREVENTED YOU FROM DOING WHATEVER IT WAS THEY WERE TRYING TO HAVE YOU
DO, YOU WOULD NOT NOW BE THE GREAT SUCCESS YOU ARE, THE TOAST OF
MALENKIGRAD AND PERHAPS EVEN OF MOSCOW. AND THE LITTLE TSARITSA HERE
SURELY LOVES YOU FOR IT."

 

  KALIININ SAID, "IF YOU DO NOT STOP THIS IMPUDENCE IMMEDIATELY, I SHALL
REPORT YOU TO THE AUTHORITIES."

 

  "GO AHEAD," SAID PALERON, HER HANDS ON HER HIPS AND HER EYEBROWS
LIFTING. "I DO MY WORK, I AM A GOOD CITIZEN, AND I HAVE DONE NOTHING
WRONG. WHAT CAN YOU REPORT? -- AND THERE IS A FANCY CAR HERE FOR YOU,
TOO."

 

  "I SAW NO FANCY CAR," SAID KALIININ.

 

  "IT IS NOT IN THE PARKING LOT, BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOTEL."

 

  "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT IS FOR ME?"

 

  "YOU ARE THE ONLY IMPORTANT PERSONS TO APPROACH THE HOTEL. FOR WHOM,
THEN, SHOULD IT BE? FOR THE PORTER? FOR THE DESK CLERK?"

 

  "COME, ALBERT," SAID KALIININ. "WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME." SHE BRUSHED
PAST THE WAITRESS, DOING THIS SO CLOSELY THAT SHE STEPPED ON HER FOOT --
PERHAPS NOT BY ACCIDENT. MORRISON FOLLOWED MEEKLY.

 

  "I HATE THAT WOMAN," MUTTERED KAFFININ AS THEY WALKED UP THE FLIGHT OF
STAIRS TO MORRISON'S SECOND-FLOOR ROOM.

 

  "DO YOU THINK THAT SHE IS AN OBSERVER OF THIS PLACE ON BEHALF OF THE
CENTRAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE?" ASKED MORRISON.

 

  "WHO KNOWS? BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER. SHE IS POSSESSED BY
A DEVIL OF IMPUDENCE. SHE DOES NOT KNOW HER PLACE."

 

  "HER PLACE? ARE THERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS, THEN, IN THE SOVIET UNION?"

 

  "DON'T BE SARCASTIC, ALBERT. THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY NONE IN THE UNITED
STATES, EITHER, BUT YOU HAVE THEM SURELY. AND SO DO WE. I KNOW WHAT THE
THEORY IS, BUT NO PERSON CAN LIVE BY THEORY ALONE. IF ARKADY'S FATHER
DIDN'T SAY THAT, HE SHOULD HAVE."

 

  THEY WALKED UP ONE FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO WHAT HAD BEEN MORRISON'S ROOM
EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND APPARENTLY STILL WAS. MORRISON VIEWED IT WITH
MILD DISTASTE. IT WAS A ROOM WITHOUT CHARM, THOUGH THE SUNLIGHT MADE IT
SEEM LESS GLOOMY THAN HE REMEMBERED IT TO BE AND, OF COURSE, THE
PROSPECT OF RETURNING HOME WAS ENOUGH TO ADD GLITTER TO ANYTHING.

 

  KALIININ SAT IN THE BETTER OF THE TWO ARMCHAIRS IN THE ROOM, HER LEGS
CROSSED, THE UPPER LEG SWINGING IN SHORT ARCS. MORRISON SAT DOWN ON THE
SIDE OF THE BED AND WATCHED HER LEGS THOUGHTFULLY. HE HAD NEVER HAD GOOD
OCCASION TO ADMIRE HIS OWN CALMNESS UNDER PRESSURE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM
RATHER UNUSUAL TO WATCH SOMEONE BE MORE NERVOUS THAN HE HIMSELF WAS.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU SEEM GREATLY TROUBLED, SOPHIA. WHAT IS WRONG?"

 

  SHE SAID, "I TOLD YOU. THAT WOMAN PALERON TROUBLES ME."

 

  "SHE CAN'T UPSET YOU THAT MUCH. WHAT'S WRONG?"

 

  "I DON'T LIKE WAITING. THE DAYS ARE LONG NOW. IT WILL BE NINE HOURS
UNTIL SUNSET."

 

  "IT'S AMAZING THAT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF HOURS. THE DIPLOMATIC
MANEUVERING COULD HAVE CONTINUED FOR MONTHS." HE SAID SO LIGHTLY ENOUGH,
BUT THE THOUGHT GAVE HIM A COLD FEELING IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH.

 

  "NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS. I'VE SEEN IT WORK BEFORE, ALBERT. THE SWEDES
ARE INVOLVED. IT'S NOT AN AMERICAN PLANE THAT'S COMING. HAVING AN
AMERICAN PLANE LAND DEEP IN SOVIET TERRITORY IS STILL SOMETHING OUR
GOVERNMENT SHIES AWAY FROM. BUT THE SWEDES -- WELL, THEY SERVE AS AN
INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS BY COMMON CONSENT AND THEY TEND TO
WORK HARD TO DEFUSE ANY POSSIBILITY OF FRICTION."

 

  "IN THE UNITED STATES, WE CONSIDER SWEDEN LUKEWARM TOWARD US AT THE
BEST. I THINK WE'D PREFER TO HAVE GREAT BRITAIN --"

 

  "OH COME, YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY TEXAS. AS IT IS, SWEDEN MAY BE
LUKEWARM TOWARD YOU, BUT SHE IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT TOWARD US.
IN ANY CASE, IT'S SWEDEN AND THEIR PRINCIPLE ALWAYS IS THAT IF IT IS
NECESSARY TO DEFUSE A SITUATION, IT IS BEST TO DEFUSE IT SWIFTLY."

 

  "IT SEEMS QUITE SWIFT TO ME. CERTAINLY, I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE IN
THE GREATER HURRY, SINCE IT IS I WHO AM MOST ANXIOUS TO LEAVE. WHY
SHOULD A FEW HOURS MATTER TO YOU?"

 

  "I'VE TOLD YOU. HE IS AFTER US." SHE GROUND OUT THE PRONOUN.

 

  "YURI? WHAT CAN HE DO? IF YOUR GOVERNMENT IS GIVING ME UP --"

 

  "THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO MIGHT EASILY NOT WISH TO
GIVE YOU UP AND OUR -- FRIEND -- KNOWS SOME OF THESE WELL."

 

  MORRISON RAISED A FINGER TO HIS LIPS AND LOOKED AROUND.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT BEING BUGGED? THAT'S ANOTHER
AMERICAN SPY NOVEL MYTH. BUGS ARE SO EASILY DETECTED THESE DAYS AND SO
EASILY SCRAMBLED -- I CARRY A SMALL DETECTOR MYSELF AND I'VE NEVER
SPOTTED ONE."

 

  MORRISON SHRUGGED. "THEN SAY WHAT YOU WISH."

 

  "OUR FRIEND IS NOT A POLITICAL EXTREMIST HIMSELF, BUT HE FINDS HE CAN
USE THOSE IN HIGH OFFICE WHO ARE. THERE ARE EXTREMISTS IN AMERICA, TOO,
I SUPPOSE. "

 

  "THOSE WHO THINK OUR POLICY TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION IS TOO MILD?"
MORRISON NODDED. "I'VE MET A FEW."

 

  "WELL, THEN, THERE YOU ARE. HIS AMBITION CONSUMES HIM AND IF EXTREMISM
WILL ADVANCE HIS PLANS, THEN HE IS PREPARED TO BE AN EXTREMIST."

 

  "SURELY YOU DON'T THINK HE CAN ARRANGE SOME SORT OF COUP IN MOSCOW AND
PUT THE DIEHARDS IN CONTROL AND DO IT ALL IN TIME TO STOP ME FROM
LEAVING FOR HOME THIS EVENING?"

 

  "YOU'VE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY AROUND, ALBERT. IF HE COULD SOMEHOW
PREVENT YOU FROM LEAVING AND PRECIPITATE A CRISIS, HE MAY BE ABLE TO
PERSUADE SOME IN THE GOVERNMENT TO STAND FIRM AND DELAY YOUR LEAVING FOR
A LONG TIME. HE CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE, OUR FRIEND, WHEN HE IS IN THE
FULL GRIP OF HIS MANIA. HE CAN SWAY EVEN NATALYA."

 

  KALIININ FELL INTO A SILENCE AND BIT AT HER LOWER LIP. FINALLY SHE
LOOKED UP AND SAID, "HE HASN'T GIVEN UP ON YOU AND HE WON'T. I'M SURE OF
IT. I'VE GOT TO GET YOU AWAY."

 

  SHE ROSE SUDDENLY AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH SHORT, QUICK
STEPS, LOOKING AS THOUGH SHE WERE TRYING TO FORCE THE UNIVERSE INTO
TURNING HER WAY. SHE STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, LISTENED, THEN JERKED
IT OPEN SUDDENLY.

 

  VALERI PALERON, HER BLAND EXPRESSION SHIFTING RAPIDLY INTO SURPRISE,
HAD ONE FIST RAISED, AS THOUGH SHE WERE ABOUT TO KNOCK.

 

  "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" SAID KALIININ TIGHTLY.

 

  "I?" SAID THE WAITRESS. "I WANT NOTHING. IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER
YOU DO. I HAVE COME TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE SOME TEA."

 

  "WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR ANY."

 

  "I DID NOT SAY YOU HAVE. I COME OUT OF COURTESY."

 

  "THEN GO OUT OF COURTESY. AND DO NOT RETURN."

 

  PALERON, REDDENING, LOOKED FROM KALIININ TO MORRISON AND SAID BETWEEN
HER TEETH, "PERHAPS I INTERRUPT A TENDER MOMENT."

 

  "LEAVE!" SAID KALIININ. SHE CLOSED THE DOOR, WAITED LONG ENOUGH TO
COUNT TO TEN IN A DELIBERATE MANNER (HER LIPS MOVING SOUNDLESSLY), AND
THEN FLUNG IT OPEN AGAIN. NO ONE WAS THERE.

 

  SHE CLOSED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT, WALKED TO THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM, AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE, "SHE HAD BEEN OUT THERE, PROBABLY, FOR
QUITE SOME TIME. I HEARD FEET SHUFFLING."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "IF HIGH-TECH BUGGING IS PASS‚, THEN I SUPPOSE THERE IS
A PREMIUM ON OLD-FASHION EAVESDROPPING."

 

  "AH, BUT FOR WHOM?"

 

  "DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE DOES IT FOR YURI? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY THAT HE
WOULD HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE SPIES -- OR DOES HE?"

 

  "IT MIGHT NOT TAKE MUCH MONEY. A WOMAN LIKE THAT MIGHT DO IT FOR
PLEASURE."

 

  THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN MORRISON SAID, "IF IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT YOU'RE BESET BY SPIES, SOPHIA, WHY NOT COME TO AMERICA
WITH ME?"

 

  "WHAT?" SHE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE HEARD HIM.

 

  "YOU MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE FOR GETTING ME OUT, YOU KNOW."

 

  "WHY? I HAVE OFFICIAL PAPERS THAT WILL PLACE YOU ON THE PLANE. I AM
UNDER ORDERS."

 

  "THAT MIGHT NOT SAVE YOU IF A SCAPEGOAT IS NEEDED. WHY NOT JUST GET ON
THE PLANE WITH ME, SOPHIA, AND COME TO AMERICA?"

 

  "JUST LIKE THAT? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY CHILD?"

 

  "WE'LL SEND FOR HER AFTERWARD."

 

  "WE'LL SEND FOR HER? WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?"

 

  MORRISON FLUSHED SLIGHTLY. "I'M NOT SURE. WE CAN BE FRIENDS,
CERTAINLY. YOU'LL NEED FRIENDS IN A NEW COUNTRY."

 

  "BUT IT CAN'T HAPPEN, ALBERT. I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS AND CONCERN
-- OR PITY -- BUT IT CAN'T HAPPEN."

 

  "YES, IT CAN. THIS IS THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, NOT THE TWENTIETH,
SOPHIA. PEOPLE MAY MOVE ABOUT FREELY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD."

 

  "DEAR ALBERT," SAID KALIININ, "YOU DO TEND TO LIVE IN THEORY. YES,
PEOPLE CAN MOVE ABOUT, BUT EVERY NATION HAS ITS EXCEPTIONS. THE SOVIET
UNION WILL NOT ALLOW A HIGHLY TRAINED SCIENTIST WITH EXPERIENCE IN
MINIATURIZATION-RELATED FIELDS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THINK ABOUT IT AND
YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT'S REASONABLE. IF I DO ACCOMPANY YOU, THERE WILL BE
AN IMMEDIATE SOVIET PROTEST, A SURE CLAIM THAT I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED,
AND THERE WILL BE A LOUD HOWL FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD THAT I BE
SENT BACK IN ORDER TO AVOID A CRISIS. SWEDEN WILL ACT AS QUICKLY FOR ME
AS SHE HAS FOR YOU."

 

  "BUT IN MY CASE, I WAS KIDNAPPED."

 

  "THERE'LL BE MANY WHO WILL BELIEVE I WAS -- OR WHO MIGHT PREFER TO
BELIEVE IT -- AND I WILL BE SENT BACK BY THE UNITED STATES, AS YOU ARE
BEING SENT BACK BY THE SOVIET UNION. WE'VE PAPERED OVER, IN THIS
FASHION, DOZENS OF CRISES OVER THE LAST SIX DECADES OR SO -- AND ISN'T
THAT BETTER THAN WAR?"

 

  "IF YOU SAY, FIRMLY AND FREQUENTLY, THAT YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE
UNITED STATES --"

 

  "THEN I NEVER SEE MY CHILD AGAIN AND MY LIFE MAY BE AT RISK, TOO.
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES."

 

  MORRISON LOOKED SURPRISED.

 

  KALIININ SAID, "DO YOU FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE? DO YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THE SOVIET UNION?"

 

  "OF COURSE NOT. MY COUNTRY --" HE STOPPED.

 

  SHE SAID, "EXACTLY. YOU TALK ENDLESSLY ABOUT HUMANITY, ABOUT THE
IMPORTANCE OF A GLOBAL VIEW, BUT IF WE SCRAPE YOU DOWN TO YOUR EMOTIONS,
IT'S YOUR COUNTRY. I HAVE A COUNTRY ALSO, A LANGUAGE, A LITERATURE, A
CULTURE, A WAY OF LIFE. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP."

 

  MORRISON SIGHED. "AS YOU SAY, SOPHIA."

 

  SOPHIA SAID, "BUT I CANNOT ENDURE IT HERE IN THIS ROOM ANY LONGER,
ALBERT. THERE'S NO USE WAITING. LET US GET INTO THE CAR AND I'LL DRIVE
YOU TO WHERE THE SWEDISH PLANE IS WAITING."

 

  "IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THERE."

 

  "THEN WE'LL WAIT AT THE AIRPORT, RATHER THAN HERE, AND WE'LL AT LEAST
BE CERTAIN THAT AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES YOU CAN BOARD IT. I WANT TO SEE
YOU SAFELY GONE, ALBERT, AND I WANT TO SEE HIS FACE AFTERWARD."

 

  SHE WAS OUT THE ROOM AND CLATTERING DOWN THE STAIRS. HE FOLLOWED
HASTILY. HE WAS, IN TRUTH, NOT SORRY TO BE GOING.

 

  THEY STRODE ALONG A CARPETED CORRIDOR AND THROUGH A DOOR THAT LED
DIRECTLY OUT TO THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL.

 

  THERE, PULLED UP CLOSE TO THE WALL, WAS A HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK
LIMOUSINE.

 

  MORRISON, A LITTLE BREATHLESS, SAID, "THEY'RE CERTAINLY SUPPLYING US
WITH DELUXE TRANSPORTATION. CAN YOU DRIVE THAT THING?"

 

  "LIKE A DREAM," SAID KALIININ, SMILING -- AND THEN CAME TO A FULL AND
SUDDEN HALT, HER SMILE FORGOTTEN.

 

  AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOTEL STEPPED KONEV. HE, TOO, HALTED AND FOR
LONG MOMENTS THEY DID NOT STIR, EITHER OF THEM -- AS THOUGH THEY WERE A
PAIR OF GORGONS, EACH OF WHOM HAD FROZEN INTO STONE AT THE GLANCE OF THE
OTHER.

 

  85.

 

  MORRISON WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK. HE SAID A LITTLE HUSKILY, "HAVE YOU
COME TO SEE ME OFF, YURI? IF SO, GOOD-BYE. I'M LEAVING."

 

  THE PHRASES SOUNDED FALSE IN HIS OWN EARS AND HIS HEART WAS POUNDING.

 

  YURI'S EYES SHIFTED JUST ENOUGH TO GLANCE QUICKLY AT MORRISON AND THEN
MOVED BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION.

 

  MORRISON SAID, "COME, SOPHIA."

 

  HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID NOTHING. WHEN SHE SPOKE -- FINALLY -- IT
WAS TO KONEV. "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" SHE DEMANDED HARSHLY.

 

  "THE AMERICAN," SAID KONEV IN A TONE NO SOFTER THAN HERS.

 

  "I'M TAKING HIM AWAY."

 

  "DON'T. WE NEED HIM. HE HAS DECEIVED US." KONEV'S VOICE WAS BECOMING
QUIETER.

 

  "SO YOU SAY," SAID KABININ. "I HAVE MY ORDERS. I AM TO TAKE HIM TO A
PLANE AND SEE THAT HE GETS IN. YOU CANNOT HAVE HIM."

 

  "IT'S NOT I WHO MUST HAVE HIM. IT'S THE NATION."

 

  "TELL ME. GO ON AND TELL ME. SAY THAT HOLY MOTHER RUSSIA NEEDS HIM AND
I'LL LAUGH IN YOUR FACE."

 

  "I'LL SAY NO SUCH THING. THE SOVIET UNION NEEDS HIM."

 

  "YOU CARE ONLY FOR YOURSELF. STEP OUT OF MY WAY."

 

  KONEV MOVED BETWEEN THE TWO OTHERS AND THE LIMO. "NO. YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS STAYING HERE. BELIEVE ME. MY REPORT HAS
ALREADY GONE TO MOSCOW."

 

  "I'M SURE AND I CAN GUESS TO WHOM IT'S GOING, TOO. BUT OLD
GRUFF-AND-GRUMBLE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. HE'S A BLOWHARD AND WE
ALL KNOW THAT. HE WON'T DARE SAY A WORD IN THE PRESIDIUM AND IF HE DOES,
ALBERT WILL BE LONG GONE."

 

  "NO. HE'S NOT GOING."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM, SOPHIA. YOU OPEN THE LIMO
DOOR." HE FELT HIMSELF TREMBLING SLIGHTLY. KONEV WAS NOT A LARGE MAN,
BUT HE LOOKED WIRY AND HE WAS CLEARLY DETERMINED. MORRISON DID NOT
BELIEVE HIMSELF TO BE A SUCCESSFUL GLADIATOR UNDER ANY CONDITIONS AND HE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ONE NOW.

 

  KALIININ LIFTED HER HAND, PALM TURNED TOWARD MORRISON. "STAY WHERE YOU
ARE, ALBERT." SHE THEN SAID TO KONEV, "HOW DO YOU INTEND TO STOP ME. DO
YOU HAVE A GUN?"

 

  KONEV LOOKED SURPRISED. "NO. OF COURSE NOT. CARRYING A HAND WEAPON IS
ILLEGAL."

 

  "INDEED? BUT I HAVE ONE." SHE DREW IT FROM HER JACKET POCKET, A SMALL
THING ALMOST ENCLOSED IN HER FIST, ITS SMALL MUZZLE GLEAMING AS IT EDGED
THROUGH THE SPACE BETWEEN HER FIRST AND SECOND FINGERS.

 

  KONEV BACKED AWAY, EYES WIDENING. "THAT'S A STUNNER."

 

  "OF COURSE. WORSE THAN A GUN, ISN'T IT? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT INTERFERE,
SO I'M PREPARED."

 

  "THAT'S ALSO ILLEGAL."

 

  "THEN REPORT ME AND I'LL PLEAD THE NEED TO FULFILL MY ORDERS AGAINST
YOUR CRIMINAL INTERFERENCE. I WILL PROBABLY GET A COMMENDATION."

 

  "YOU WON'T. SOPHIA --" HE TOOK A STEP TOWARD HER.

 

  SHE TOOK A STEP BACK. "NO CLOSER. I'M READY TO SHOOT AND I MIGHT DO SO
EVEN IF YOU STAND WHERE YOU ARE. JUST KEEP IN MIND WHAT A STUNNER DOES.
IT SCRAMBLES YOUR BRAIN. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU ONCE TOLD ME? YOU'LL BE
UNCONSCIOUS AND YOU'LL WAKE UP WITH PARTIAL AMNESIA AND IT MAY TAKE YOU
HOURS TO RECOVER OR EVEN DAYS. I'VE EVEN HEARD THAT SOME PEOPLE NEVER
QUITE RECOVER. IMAGINE IF YOUR MAGNIFICENT BRAIN SHOULD NOT QUITE REGAIN
ITS FINE EDGE."

 

  "SOPHIA," HE SAID AGAIN.

 

  SHE SAID, THROUGH ALMOST CLOSED LIPS, "WHY DO YOU USE MY NAME? THE
LAST TIME I HEARD YOU USE IT, YOU SAID, 'SOPHIA, WE WILL NEVER SPEAK
AGAIN, NEVER LOOK AT EACH OTHER AGAIN.' YOU ARE NOW SPEAKING TO ME,
LOOKING AT ME. GO AWAY AND KEEP YOUR PROMISE, YOU MISERABLE --" (SHE
USED A RUSSIAN WORD THAT MORRISON DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.)

 

  KONEV, WHITE TO HIS LIPS, SAID A THIRD TIME, "SOPHIA -- LISTEN TO ME.
BELIEVE THAT EVERY WORD I HAVE EVER SAID IS A LIE, BUT LISTEN TO ME NOW.
THAT AMERICAN IS A DEADLY THREAT TO THE SOVIET UNION. IF YOU LOVE YOUR
COUNTRY --"

 

  "I'M TIRED OF LOVING. WHAT HAS IT GOTTEN ME?"

 

  "AND WHAT HAS IT GOTTEN ME?" WHISPERED KONEV.

 

  "YOU LOVE YOURSELF," SAID KALIININ BITTERLY.

 

  "NO! YOU KEPT SAYING THAT, BUT IT'S NOT SO. IF I HAVE SOME REGARD FOR
MYSELF NOW, IT IS BECAUSE ONLY I CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY."

 

  "YOU BELIEVE THAT?" SAID KALIININ, WONDERING. "YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT? -- YOU ARE MAD TO DO SO."

 

  "NOT AT ALL. I KNOW MY OWN WORTH. I COULDN'T LET ANYTHING DETER ME --
NOT EVEN YOU. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY AND MY WORK, I HAD TO GIVE YOU
UP. I HAD TO GIVE UP MY CHILD. I HAD TO TEAR MYSELF IN TWO AND THROW THE
BETTER HALF OF MYSELF AWAY."

 

  "YOUR CHILD?" KALIININ SAID. "ARE YOU CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY?"

 

  KONEV'S HEAD BENT. "HOW ELSE COULD I DRIVE YOU AWAY? HOW ELSE COULD I
BE SURE I WOULD WORK UNIMPEDED? -- I LOVE YOU. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
I HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG IT WAS MY CHILD AND THAT IT COULD BE NO ONE
ELSE'S."

 

  "DO YOU WANT ALBERT SO MUCH?" HER STUNNER DID NOT WAVER. "ARE YOU
WILLING TO SAY THAT IT IS YOUR CHILD -- SAY YOU LOVE ME -- BELIEVE I
WILL, FOR THAT, GIVE YOU ALBERT -- AND THEN DENY IT ALL AGAIN? HOW LOW
AN OPINION YOU MUST HAVE OF MY INTELLIGENCE."

 

  KONEV SHOOK HIS HEAD. "HOW CAN I CONVINCE YOU? -- WELL, IF I
DELIBERATELY THREW IT ALL AWAY, I CAN'T EXPECT TO GET IT BACK AGAIN, CAN
I? WILL YOU, IN THAT CASE, GIVE ME THE AMERICAN FOR THE SAKE OF OUR
NATION AND THEN THROW ME AWAY? WOULD YOU LET ME EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR
HIM?"

 

  "I WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE EXPLANATION." KALIININ THREW A QUICK GLANCE IN
MORRISON'S DIRECTION. "DO YOU HEAR THIS MAN, ALBERT?" SHE SAID. "YOU
DON'T KNOW WITH WHAT CRUELTY HE CAST MY DAUGHTER AND ME ASIDE. NOW HE
EXPECTS ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE LOVED ME ALL ALONG."

 

  AND MORRISON HEARD HIMSELF SAY, "THAT MUCH IS TRUE, SOPHIA. HE LOVES
YOU AND HE HAS ALWAYS LOVED YOU -- DESPERATELY."

 

  KALIININ FROZE FOR A MOMENT. HER FREE LEFT HAND GESTURED AT MORRISON
WHILE HER EYES REMAINED FIXED ON KONEV. "HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, ALBERT?
DID HE LIE TO YOU, TOO?"

 

  BUT KONEV SHOUTED IN EXCITEMENT, "HE KNOWS. HE ADMITS IT. DON'T YOU
SEE? HE SENSED IT WITH HIS COMPUTER. IF YOU NOW LET ME EXPLAIN, YOU WILL
BELIEVE EVERYTHING."

 

  KALIININ SAID, "IS THIS TRUE, THEN, ALBERT? DO YOU CONFIRM YURI?"

 

  AND MORRISON, TOO LATE, CLAMPED HIS MOUTH SHUT, BUT HIS EYES GAVE HIM
AWAY.

 

  KONEV SAID, "MY LOVE HAS BEEN UNWAVERING, SOPHIA. AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE
SUFFERED, SO MUCH HAVE I. BUT GIVE ME THE AMERICAN AND THERE WILL BE NO
MORE OF IT. I WILL NO LONGER ASK THAT I BE SPARED ANY CHANCE OF
HINDRANCE. I WILL DO MY WORK AND HAVE YOU AND THE CHILD, TOO, WHATEVER
THE COST MAY BE -- AND MAY I BE CURSED IF I DON'T MANAGE BOTH."

 

  KALIININ STARED AT KONEV, HER EYES SUDDENLY SWIMMING IN TEARS. "I WANT
TO BELIEVE YOU," SHE WHISPERED.

 

  "THEN BELIEVE. THE AMERICAN HAS TOLD YOU."

 

  AS THOUGH SHE WERE SLEEPWALKING, SHE MOVED TOWARD KONEV, HOLDING THE
STUNNER OUT TO HIM.

 

  MORRISON SHOUTED, "YOUR ORDERS -- TO THE PLANE!" HE RUSHED WILDLY AT
THEM.

 

  BUT AS HE DID SO, HE COLLIDED HEAVILY WITH ANOTHER BODY. ARMS WERE
AROUND HIM, HOLDING HIM CLOSELY, AND A VOICE IN HIS EAR SAID, "TAKE IT
EASY, COMRADE AMERICAN. DO NOT ATTACK TWO GOOD SOVIET CITIZENS."

 

  IT WAS VALERI PALERON, WHO HELD HIM IN A STRONG AND UNBREAKABLE GRIP.

 

  KALIININ CLUNG AS CLOSELY TO KONEV, THOUGH WITH DIFFERENT EFFECT, THE
STUNNER STILL GRIPPED LOOSELY IN HER RIGHT HAND.

 

  PALERON SAID, "ACADEMICIAN, DOCTOR, WE COULD BECOME CONSPICUOUS HERE.
LET US GO BACK TO THE AMERICAN'S ROOM. COME, COMRADE AMERICAN, AND COME
QUIETLY OR I WILL BE COMPELLED TO HURT YOU."

 

  KONEV, CATCHING MORRISON'S EYE, SMILED TIGHTLY IN ABSOLUTE TRIUMPH. HE
HAD IT ALL -- HIS WOMAN, HIS CHILD, AND HIS AMERICAN -- AND MORRISON SAW
HIS DREAM OF RETURNING TO AMERICA POP LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE AND VANISH.

 

 

 

  CHAPTER 19 -- TURNAROUND

 

  IN THE TRUE TRIUMPH, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO LOSERS.

 

  -- DEZHNEV SENIOR

 

  86.

 

  MORRISON SAT IN THE HOTEL ROOM THAT HE HAD, FOR SOME FIFTEEN MINUTES,
THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN. HE WAS CLOSE TO DESPAIR -- CLOSER, IT
SEEMED TO HIM, THAN HE HAD BEEN EVEN WHEN HE WAS ALONE AND LOST IN THE
CELLULAR STREAM OF THE NEURON.

 

  WHAT WAS THE USE? OVER AND OVER AGAIN, HE THOUGHT THIS, AS THOUGH THE
PHRASE WERE REVERBERATING IN AN ECHO CHAMBER. HE WAS A LOSER. HE HAD
ALWAYS BEEN A LOSER.

 

  FOR A DAY OR SO, HE HAD THOUGHT THAT SOPHIA KALIININ HAD BEEN
ATTRACTED TO HIM, BUT, OF COURSE, SHE HADN'T. HE HAD BEEN NOTHING MORE
THAN HER WEAPON AGAINST KONEV AND WHEN KONEV HAD CALLED TO HER --
BECKONED TO HER -- SHE HAD RETURNED TO HIM AND HAD THEN NO FURTHER USE
FOR HER WEAPONS, EITHER FOR MORRISON OR FOR HER STUNNER.

 

  HE LOOKED AT THEM DULLY. THEY WERE STANDING TOGETHER IN THE SUNLIGHT
STREAMING THROUGH THE WINDOW -- THEY IN THE SUNLIGHT, HE IN THE SHADOW,
AS IT MUST ALWAYS BE.

 

  THEY WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER, SO LOST IN EACH OTHER THAT KALIININ
SEEMED UNAWARE THAT SHE WAS STILL HOLDING THE STUNNER. FOR A MOMENT, HER
KNEES BENT AS THOUGH SHE WAS GOING TO GET RID OF ITS WEIGHT BY DROPPING
IT ON THE BED, BUT THEN KONEV SAID SOMETHING AND SHE WAS ALL ATTENTION
AND AGAIN UNAWARE OF THE STUNNER'S EXISTENCE.

 

  MORRISON CALLED OUT HOARSELY, "YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ENDURE THIS.
YOU HAVE ORDERS TO RELEASE ME."

 

  KONEV LOOKED UP, HIS EYES BRIGHTENING SLIGHTLY, AS THOUGH HE WERE
BEING PERSUADED, WITH DIFFICULTY, TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS CAPTIVE. IT
WAS NOT, AFTER ALL, AS THOUGH HE HAD TO WATCH MORRISON IN ANY PHYSICAL
SENSE. THE WAITRESS, VALERI PALERON, WAS DOING THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY.
SHE STOOD A METER FROM MORRISON AND HER EYES (SOMEHOW AMUSED -- AS
THOUGH SHE ENJOYED THE JOB) NEVER LEFT HIM.

 

  KONEV SAID, "MY GOVERNMENT NEED NOT CONCERN YOU, ALBERT. IT WILL
CHANGE ITS MIND SOON ENOUGH."

 

  KALIININ RAISED HER LEFT HAND AS THOUGH TO OBJECT, BUT KONEV ENCLOSED
IT IN HIS.

 

  "DO NOT BE CONCERNED, SOPHIA," HE SAID. "INFORMATION AT MY DISPOSAL
HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO MOSCOW. IT WILL MAKE THEM THINK. THEY WILL GET
BACK TO ME ON MY PERSONAL WAVELENGTH BEFORE LONG AND WHEN I TELL THEM WE
HAVE SAFELY SECURED MORRISON, THEY WILL TAKE ACTION. I AM SURE THEY WILL
HAVE THE PERSUASIVE POWER TO MAKE THE OLD MAN SEE REASON. I PROMISE YOU
THAT."

 

  KALIININ SAID IN A TROUBLED VOICE, "ALBERT!"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "ARE YOU GETTING READY TO TELL ME THAT YOU ARE SORRY,
SOPHIA, THAT YOU CROSSED ME OUT OF EXISTENCE AT ONE WORD FROM THE MAN
YOU SEEMED TO HAVE HATED?"

 

  KALIININ REDDENED. "YOU ARE NOT CROSSED OUT OF EXISTENCE, ALBERT. YOU
WILL BE WELL-TREATED. YOU WILL WORK HERE AS YOU WOULD HAVE WORKED IN
YOUR OWN COUNTRY, EXCEPT THAT HERE YOU WILL BE TRULY APPRECIATED."

 

  "THANK YOU," SAID MORRISON, FINDING SOME SMALL RESERVOIR OF THE
SARDONIC INSIDE HIMSELF. "IF YOU FEEL HAPPY FOR ME, OF WHAT IMPORTANCE
IS MY FEELING FOR MYSELF?"

 

  PALERON INTERVENED IMPATIENTLY, "COMRADE AMERICAN, YOU TALK TOO MUCH.
WHY DO YOU NOT SIT DOWN? -- SIT DOWN. " (SHE PUSHED HIM INTO A CHAIR.)
"YOU MAY AS WELL WAIT QUIETLY, SINCE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO."

 

  SHE THEN TURNED TO KALIININ, AROUND WHOSE SHOULDERS KONEV'S RIGHT ARM
WAS PROTECTIVELY PLACED. "AND YOU, LITTLE TSARITSA," SHE SAID, "ARE YOU
STILL PLANNING TO PLACE THIS FINE LOVER OF YOURS OUT OF ACTION THAT YOU
HOLD THIS STUNNER SO MENACINGLY IN YOUR HAND? YOU WILL BE ABLE TO
EMBRACE HIM THE MORE TIGHTLY IF BOTH ARMS ARE FREE."

 

  PALERON REACHED FOR THE STUNNER KALIININ WAS HOLDING AND KALIININ GAVE
IT UP WITHOUT A WORD.

 

  "ACTUALLY," SAID PALERON, LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE STUNNER, "I AM
RELIEVED AT HAVING IT. IN THE PAROXYSM OF YOUR NEWFOUND LOVE, I FEARED
YOU MIGHT SHOOT IN ALL DIRECTIONS. IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE IN YOUR HANDS,
MY LITTLE ONE."

 

  SHE MOVED BACK TO THE VICINITY OF MORRISON, STILL STUDYING THE STUNNER
AND TURNING IT IN VARIOUS WAYS.

 

  MORRISON STIRRED UNEASILY. "DON'T POINT IT IN MY DIRECTION, WOMAN. IT
MAY GO OFF."

 

  PALERON LOOKED AT HIM HAUGHTILY. "IT WILL NOT GO OFF IF I DON'T WANT
IT TO, COMRADE AMERICAN. I KNOW HOW TO USE IT."

 

  SHE SMILED IN THE DIRECTION OF KONEV AND KALIININ. RELIEVED OF THE
WEAPON, KALIININ NOW HAD BOTH ARMS AROUND KONEV'S NECK AND WAS KISSING
HIM WITH QUICK, GENTLE TOUCHES OF HER LIPS AGAINST HIS. PALERON SAID IN
THEIR DIRECTION, BUT NOT REALLY TO THEM, FOR THEY WEREN'T LISTENING, "I
KNOW HOW TO USE IT. LIKE THIS! AND LIKE THIS!"

 

  AND FIRST KONEV, THEN KALIININ CRUMPLED.

 

  PALERON TURNED TOWARD MORRISON. "NOW HELP ME, YOU IDIOT, WE MUST WORK
QUICKLY."

 

  SHE SAID IT IN ENGLISH.

 

  87.

 

  MORRISON HAD DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING. HE SIMPLY STARED AT HER.

 

  PALERON PUSHED HIS SHOULDER AS THOUGH SHE WERE TRYING TO AWAKEN HIM
FROM A DEEP SLEEP. "COME ON. YOU GRAB THE FEET."

 

  MORRISON OBEYED MECHANICALLY. FIRST KONEV AND THEN KALIININ WERE
LIFTED ONTO THE BED, FROM WHICH PALERON HAD STRIPPED THE THIN BLANKET.
SHE STRETCHED BOTH OF THEM OUT ALONG THE NARROW CONFINES OF THE SINGLE
MATTRESS, THEN SEARCHED KALIINEN IN A QUICK, PRACTICED WAY.

 

  "AH," SHE SAID, STARING AT A SHEET OF FOLDED PAPER, WHOSE CLOSE-SET
PRINT MARKED IT INDELIBLY AS SOMETHING WRITTEN IN GOVERNMENTESE. SHE
FLIPPED IT INTO THE POCKET OF HER WHITE JACKET AND CONTINUED THE SEARCH.
OTHER ITEMS CAME TO LIGHT -- A PAIR OF SMALL KEYS, FOR INSTANCE. QUICKLY
SHE WENT OVER KONEV, PLUCKING A SMALL METALLIC DISC FROM THE INNER
SURFACE OF HIS LAPEL.

 

  "HIS PERSONAL WAVELENGTH," SHE SAID AND PLACED THAT, TOO, INTO HER
POCKET.

 

  FINALLY SHE RETRIEVED A BLACK RECTANGULAR OBJECT AND SAID, "THIS IS
YOURS, ISN'T IT?"

 

  MORRISON GRUNTED. IT WAS HIS COMPUTER PROGRAM. HE HAD BEEN SO FAR GONE
HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE THAT KONEV HAD TAKEN IT FROM HIM. HE CLUTCHED AT
IT FRANTICALLY NOW.

 

  PALERON TURNED KALIININ AND KONEV TOWARD EACH OTHER, PROPPING THEM SO
THAT THEY WOULD NOT FALL APART. SHE THEN PLACED KONEV'S ARM AROUND
KALIININ AND COVERED THE TWO WITH THE BLANKET, TUCKING IT IN UNDER EACH
TO HELP KEEP THEM IN PLACE.

 

  "DON'T STARE AT ME LIKE THAT, MORRISON," SHE SAID WHEN SHE WAS DONE.
"COME ON." SHE SEIZED HIS UPPER ARM IN A FIRM GRIP.

 

  HE RESISTED. "WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHAT'S HAPPENING?"

 

  "I'LL TELL YOU LATER. NOT A WORD NOW. THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE. NOT A
MINUTE. NOT A SECOND. COME." SHE ENDED WITH SOFT FIERCENESS AND MORRISON
FOLLOWED HER.

 

  OUT OF THE ROOM THEY WENT, DOWN THE STAIRS AS SOFTLY AS SHE COULD
MANAGE (HE FOLLOWING AND IMITATING), ALONG THE CARPETED CORRIDOR, AND
OUT TO THE LIMOUSINE.

 

  PALERON OPENED THE FRONT DOOR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WITH ONE OF THE
KEYS SHE HAD OBTAINED FROM KALIININ'S POCKET AND SAID BRUSQUELY, "GET
IN."

 

  "WHERE ARE WE GOING?"

 

  "GET IN." SHE VIRTUALLY HURLED HIM INTO THE LIMO.

 

  SHE SETTLED QUICKLY BEHIND THE WHEEL AND MORRISON RESISTED THE IMPULSE
TO ASK HER IF SHE KNEW HOW TO DRIVE. IT HAD FINALLY GOTTEN THROUGH TO
HIS STUNNED MIND THAT PALERON WASN'T SIMPLY A WAITRESS.

 

  THAT SHE HAD PLAYED THE PART OF ONE, HOWEVER, WAS MADE PLAIN BY THE
FAINT ODOR OF ONIONS STILL CLINGING TO HER AND MIXING RATHER
INFELICITOUSLY WITH THE RICHER AND PLEASANTER ODOR OF THE LIMO'S
INTERIOR.

 

  PALERON STARTED THE ENGINE, LOOKED AROUND THE PARKING AREA, WHICH WAS
DESERTED EXCEPT FOR A CAT GOING ABOUT SOME BUSINESS OF ITS OWN, AND
MOVED OUT OVER A SANDY PATCH TO THE PATH THAT LED TO THE NEARBY ROAD.

 

  SLOWLY THE LIMO PICKED UP SPEED AND WHEN IT FINALLY REACHED THE
NINETY-FIVE KILOMETER-PER-HOUR MARK, IT WAS MOVING ALONG A TWO-LANE
HIGHWAY ON WHICH, OCCASIONALLY, AN AUTOMOBILE, MOVING IN THE OTHER
DIRECTION, PASSED THEM. MORRISON FOUND HIMSELF CAPABLE OF THINKING
NORMALLY AGAIN.

 

  HE GLANCED BACK EARNESTLY THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW. A CAR, FAR BEHIND
THEM, WAS TURNING OFF AT AN INTERSECTION THEY HAD PASSED SOME MOMENTS
BEFORE. NO ONE APPEARED TO BE FOLLOWING THEM.

 

  MORRISON THEN TURNED TO WATCH PALERON'S PROFILE. SHE SEEMED COMPETENT
BUT GRIM. IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM NOW THAT SHE WAS NOT ONLY NO WAITRESS BY
TRUE PROFESSION BUT WAS VERY LIKELY NO SOVIET CITIZEN. HER ENGLISH HAD A
STRONG URBAN ACCENT THAT NO EUROPEAN WOULD LEARN IN SCHOOL OR COULD PICK
UP IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE TRUE ENOUGH TO FOOL MORRISON'S EAR.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU WERE WAITING THERE OUTSIDE THE HOTEL, READING A BOOK, SO
THAT YOU WOULD SEE SOPHIA AND MYSELF WHEN WE CAME."

 

  "YOU GOT IT," SAID PALERON.

 

  "YOU'RE AN AMERICAN AGENT, AREN'T YOU?"

 

  "SHREWDER AND SHREWDER."

 

  "WHERE ARE WE GOING?"

 

  "TO THE DESIGNATED AIRPORT WHERE THE SWEDISH PLANE WILL PICK YOU UP. I
HAD TO GET THE DETAILS ON THAT FROM KALIININ."

 

  "AND YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THERE?"

 

  "YES, INDEED. I'VE BEEN IN MALENKIGRAD FOR CONSIDERABLY LONGER A
PERIOD THAN YOUR KALIININ HAS BEEN HERE. -- BUT TELL ME, WHY DID YOU
TELL HER THIS MAN, KONEV, WAS IN LOVE WITH HER? SHE WAS JUST WAITING TO
HEAR THAT FROM A THIRD PERSON. SHE WANTED IT CONFIRMED AND YOU DID THAT
FOR HER. IN THAT WAY, YOU HANDED OVER THE WHOLE GAME TO KONEV. WHY DID
YOU DO IT?"

 

  "FOR ONE THING," SAID MORRISON MILDLY, "IT WAS THE TRUTH."

 

  "THE TRUTH?" PALERON, LOOKING BEMUSED, SHOOK HER HEAD. "YOU DON'T
BELONG IN THE REAL WORLD. YOU SURE DON'T. I'M SURPRISED NO ONE KNOCKED
YOU ON THE HEAD AND BURIED YOU LONG AGO -- JUST FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
BESIDES, HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "I KNOW. -- BUT I WAS SORRY FOR HER. SHE SAVED MY LIFE
YESTERDAY. SHE SAVED ALL OUR LIVES YESTERDAY. FOR THAT MATTER, KONEV
SAVED MY LIFE, TOO."

 

  "YOU ALL SAVED EACH OTHER'S LIFE, I SUPPOSE."

 

  "YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT."

 

  "BUT THAT WAS YESTERDAY. TODAY YOU STARTED FRESH AND YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET YESTERDAY INFLUENCE YOU. SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN UP WITH HIM
AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOUR DUMB REMARK. HE COULD HAVE SWORN HIMSELF
PURPLE ABOUT LOVING HER AND ALL THE REST OF THAT RUBBISH AND SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED HIM. SHE DARED NOT. BE MADE A FOOL OF AGAIN?
NEVER! SHE WOULD HAVE STUNNED HIM TO THE GROUND IN ANOTHER MINUTE AND
THEN YOU TOLD HER, 'WHY, YES, KID, THAT THERE GUY LOVES YOU,' AND THAT'S
ALL SHE NEEDED. I TELL YOU, MORRISON, YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT WITHOUT YOUR
KEEPER."

 

  MORRISON STIRRED UNEASILY, "HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?"

 

  "I WAS ON THE FLOOR IN THE BACK SEAT OF THIS CAR, READY TO GO WITH YOU
AND KALIININ AND TO MAKE SURE SHE TOOK YOU THERE. AND THEN YOU PULLED
YOUR DUMB TRICK. WHAT WAS THERE TO DO BUT GRAB YOU AND KEEP YOU FROM
BEING STUNNED DOWN, THEN GET YOU BACK TO THE ROOM WHERE WE COULD HAVE
SOME PRIVACY, AND AFTER THAT GET HOLD OF THE STUNNER SOMEHOW?"

 

  "THANK YOU."

 

  "THAT'S ALL RIGHT. -- AND I MADE THEM LOOK LIKE A LOVING COUPLE, TOO.
ANYONE COMING IN WILL BE BOUND TO SAY, 'EXCUSE ME,' AND LEAVE QUICKLY --
AND THAT WILL GIVE US MORE TIME."

 

  "HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE THEY'RE CONSCIOUS AGAIN?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. IT DEPENDS ON HOW ACCURATELY I PLACED THE RADIATION AND
WHAT EACH STATE OF MIND WAS AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE. BUT WHEN THEY DO
COME BACK, IT WILL TAKE THEM SOME TIME TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. I'M
HOPING THAT IN THEIR POSITION, THE FIRST THING THEY'LL REMEMBER IS THAT
THEY'RE IN LOVE. THAT WOULD PREOCCUPY THEM FOR A WHILE. THEN WHEN THEY
DO GET AROUND TO REMEMBERING YOU AND WHAT IT WAS THAT WAS BEING DONE
WITH MOSCOW, IT WILL BE TOO LATE."

 

  "ARE THEY GOING TO BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED?"

 

  PALERON CAST A QUICK LOOK AT MORRISON'S CONCERNED FACE. "YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT THEM, AREN'T YOU? WHY? WHAT ARE THEY TO YOU?"

 

  "WELL ... SHIPMATES."

 

  PALERON MADE AN INELEGANT SOUND. "I GUESS THEY'LL RECOVER OKAY. THEY
MIGHT BE BETTER OFF IF SOME OF THAT SUPERSENSITIVE EDGE IS GROUND OFF.
THEY CAN GET TOGETHER AND MAKE A NICE FAMILY THEN."

 

  "AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU? YOU'D BETTER GET ON THE PLANE WITH
ME."

 

  "DON'T BE A JACKASS. THE SWEDES WOULDN'T TAKE ME. THEY'VE GOT ORDERS
TO TAKE ONE GUY AND THEY'LL TEST YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE THE RIGHT ONE.
THEY'LL HAVE RECORDS OF YOUR FINGERPRINTS AND YOUR RETINA PATTERN, RIGHT
OUT OF THE FILES OF THE POPULATION BOARD. IF THEY TAKE THE WRONG PERSON
OR AN ADDITIONAL PERSON, THAT'LL BE A NEW INCIDENT AND THE SWEDES ARE
TOO SMART FOR THAT."

 

  "BUT THEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU?"

 

  "WELL, FOR STARTERS, I'LL SAY YOU GOT HOLD OF THE STUNNER AND RAYED
THEM BOTH, THEN HELD THE STUNNER ON ME AND MADE ME TAKE YOU TO THE
AIRPORT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW ITS LOCATION. YOU ORDERED ME TO STOP
OUTSIDE THE GATES, THEN STUNNED ME DOWN AND TOSSED THE STUNNER INTO THE
CAR. EARLY TOMORROW, I'LL MAKE MY WAY BACK TO MALENKIGRAD, LIKE I WAS
COMING OUT OF A STUNNING."

 

  "BUT KONEV AND KALIININ WILL DENY YOUR STORY."

 

  "THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AT ME WHEN THEY WERE STUNNED AND ALMOST NO ONE
REMEMBERS THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF STUNNING, ANYWAY. BESIDES, THE SOVIET
GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT THEY ORDERED YOU RETURNED AND IF YOU ARE RETURNED,
THEN ANYTHING KONEV WILL TELL THEM ABOUT YOU WILL DO HIM NO GOOD. THE
GOVERNMENT WILL ACCEPT THE FAIT ACCOMPLI. IT'S RUBLES TO KOPEKS OR,
BETTER, DOLLARS TO KOPEKS THAT THEY'LL PREFER TO FORGET THE WHOLE THING
-- AND I'LL JUST GO BACK TO WAITRESSING."

 

  "THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME SUSPICION CLINGING TO YOU."

 

  "THEN WE'LL SEE," SHE SAID. "NICHEVO! WHAT WILL BE, WILL BE." SHE
SMILED FAINTLY.

 

  THEY CONTINUED TO TRAVEL ALONG THE HIGHWAY AND MORRISON FINALLY SAID
WITH A TOUCH OF DIFFIDENCE, "SHOULDN'T WE TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE?"

 

  "NOT EVEN BY A KILOMETER PER HOUR," SAID PALERON FIRMLY. "WE'RE GOING
AT JUST UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT AND THE SOVIETS HAVE EVERY CENTIMETER OF
THE HIGHWAY RADARIZED. THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THE SPEED LIMIT
AND I DON'T INTEND TO SPEND HOURS TRYING TO GET OUT OF A POLICE STATION
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES REACHING THE PLANE."

 

  IT WAS PAST NOON NOW AND MORRISON WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE MILD,
PREMONITORY PINCHES OF HUNGER. HE SAID, "WHAT WAS IT THAT KONEV TOLD
MOSCOW ABOUT ME, DO YOU SUPPOSE?"

 

  PALERON SHOOK HER HEAD. "DON'T KNOW. WHATEVER IT WAS, HE GOT A
RESPONSE ON HIS PERSONAL WAVELENGTH. IT SIGNALED ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES
AGO. YOU DIDN'T HEAR?"

 

  "NO."

 

  "YOU WOULDN'T LAST LONG IN MY BUSINESS. -- NATURALLY, THEY GOT NO
ANSWER, SO WHOEVER KONEV WAS TALKING TO IN MOSCOW WILL TRY TO FIND OUT
WHY. SOMEONE WILL FIND THEM AND THEN THEY'LL FIGURE YOU'RE ON THE WAY TO
THE AIRPORT AND SOMEONE WILL CHASE OUT AFTER US TO SEE IF YOU CAN BE
HEADED OFF. LIKE PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS."

 

  "WE DON'T HAVE MOSES TO PART THE RED SEA FOR US," MUTTERED MORRISON.

 

  "IF WE GET TO THE AIRPORT, WE'LL HAVE THE SWEDES. THEY WON'T GIVE YOU
UP TO ANYBODY."

 

  "WHAT CAN THEY DO AGAINST THE SOVIET MILITARY?"

 

  "IT WON'T BE THE SOVIET MILITARY. IT WILL BE SOME FUNCTIONARY, WORKING
FOR AN EXTREMIST SPLINTER GROUP, WHO WILL TRY TO BLUFF THE SWEDES. BUT
WE HAVE OFFICIAL PAPERS GIVING YOU UP TO THEM AND THEY WON'T BE BLUFFED.
WE JUST HAVE TO GET THERE FIRST."

 

  "AND YOU DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO FASTER?"

 

  PALERON SHOOK HER HEAD FIRMLY.

 

  HALF AN HOUR LATER, PALERON POINTED AND SAID, "THERE WE ARE AND WE
HAVE THE BREAKS. THE SWEDISH PLANE IS IN EARLY AND HAS LANDED."

 

  SHE STOPPED THE CAR, PRESSED A BUTTON, AND THE DOOR FLEW OPEN ON HIS
SIDE. "YOU GO ON ALONE. I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN, BUT LISTEN --" SHE
LEANED TOWARD HIM. "MY NAME IS ASHBY. WHEN YOU GET TO WASHINGTON, TELL
THEM THAT IF THEY THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GET OUT -- I'M READY. GOT
IT?"

 

  "I'VE GOT IT."

 

  MORRISON GOT OUT OF THE CAR, BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT. IN THE
DISTANCE, A MAN IN UNIFORM -- NOT A SOVIET UNIFORM, AS NEARLY AS HE
COULD TELL -- WAVED HIM FORWARD.

 

  MORRISON BROKE INTO A RUN. THERE WERE NO SPEED LIMITS ON RUNNING AND
THOUGH HE COULD SEE NO ONE IN PURSUIT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
TO SEE SOMEONE RISE OUT OF THE GROUND TO STOP HIM.

 

  HE TURNED, WAVED A LAST TIME IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR, THOUGHT HE
SAW AN ANSWERING WAVE, AND CONTINUED TO RUN.

 

  THE MAN WHO HAD GESTURED TO HIM ADVANCED, FIRST AT A WALK, THEN AT A
RUN, AND CAUGHT HIM AS HE ALL BUT FELL FORWARD. MORRISON COULD SEE NOW
THAT HE WAS WEARING A EUROPEAN FEDERATION UNIFORM.

 

  "MAY I PLEASE HAVE YOUR NAME?" SAID THE MAN IN ENGLISH. HIS ACCENT, TO
MORRISON'S INFINITE RELIEF, WAS SWEDISH.

 

  "ALBERT JONAS MORRISON," HE SAID AND TOGETHER THEY WALKED TOWARD THE
PLANE AND THE SMALL GROUP WAITING TO CHECK HIS IDENTITY.

 

  88.

 

  MORRISON SAT AT THE PLANE WINDOW, TENSE AND EXHAUSTED, STARING
DOWNWARD AT THE LAND FLEEING EAST. A LUNCH, CONSISTING LARGELY OF
HERRING AND BOILED POTATOES, HAD SOOTHED THE INNER MAN BUT SCARCELY THE
INNER MIND.

 

  HAD THE MINIATURIZED TRIP THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM AND BRAIN YESTERDAY
(ONLY YESTERDAY?) TWISTED HIM FOREVER INTO A MENTAL ATTITUDE OF
APPREHENSION OF IMMINENT DISASTER? WOULD HE NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO
ACCEPT THE UNIVERSE AS FRIENDLY? WOULD HE NEVER WALK THROUGH IT IN
SERENE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT NO ONE AND NO THING WISHED HIM HARM?

 

  OR HAD THERE MERELY BEEN INSUFFICIENT TIME FOR HIM TO RECOVER?

 

  OF COURSE, COMMON SENSE TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS REASON NOT TO FEEL
COMPLETELY SAFE YET. THAT WAS STILL SOVIET EARTH UNDER THE PLANE.

 

  WAS THERE STILL TIME FOR KONEV'S ALLY IN MOSCOW, WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE,
TO SEND OUT PLANES AFTER THE SWEDES? WAS HE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO SO?
WOULD PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS TAKE TO THE AIR AND CONTINUE THE PURSUIT?

 

  FOR A MOMENT, HIS HEART FAILED HIM WHEN HE ACTUALLY SAW A PLANE IN THE
DISTANCE -- THEN ANOTHER.

 

  HE TURNED TO THE STEWARDESS, WHO SAT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM HIM. HE DID
NOT HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION. SHE APPARENTLY READ HIS ANXIOUS EXPRESSION
ACCURATELY.

 

  "FEDERATION PLANES," SHE SAID, "AS ESCORT. WE'VE LEFT SOVIET
TERRITORY. THE PLANES ARE SWEDISH-CREWED."

 

  THEN, WHEN THEY PASSED OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL, AMERICAN PLANES
JOINED THE ESCORT. MORRISON WAS SAFE FROM THE CHARIOTS, AT ANY RATE.

 

  HIS MIND DID NOT LET HIM REST, HOWEVER. MISSILES? WOULD SOMEONE
ACTUALLY COMMIT AN ACT OF WAR? HE TRIED TO CALM HIMSELF. SURELY NO MAN
IN THE SOVIET UNION, NOT EVEN THE SOVIET EXECUTIVE HIMSELF, COULD MAKE
SUCH A MOVE WITHOUT CONSULTATION AND NO CONSULTATION WOULD TAKE LESS
THAN HOURS OR PERHAPS DAYS.

 

  IT COULDN'T BE.

 

  STILL, IT WASN'T UNTIL THE PLANE HAD LANDED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF
WASHINGTON THAT MORRISON COULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO FEEL THAT IT WAS OVER
AND THAT HE WAS SAFELY IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.

 

  89.

 

  IT WAS SATURDAY MORNING AND MORRISON WAS RECOVERING. HE HAD ATTENDED
TO HIS CREATURE NEEDS. HE HAD HAD BREAKFAST AND HAD WASHED. HE WAS EVEN
PARTLY DRESSED.

 

  NOW HE LAY IN BED ON HIS BACK, ARMS BEHIND HIS HEAD. IT WAS CLOUDY
OUTSIDE AND HE HAD ONLY HALF-CLARIFIED THE WINDOW BECAUSE HE WANTED A
SENSE OF PRIVACY. IN THE HOURS AFTER HE HAD DISEMBARKED FROM THE PLANE
AND HAD BEEN RUSHED TO HIS PRESENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT, THERE HAD BEEN
ENOUGH OFFICIAL CROWDING AROUND HIM TO MAKE HIM WONDER A BIT IF HE WAS
ANY BETTER OFF IN THE UNITED STATES THAN HE HAD BEEN IN THE SOVIET
UNION.

 

  THE DOCTORS HAD FINALLY FINISHED THEIR PROBING, THE INITIAL QUESTIONS
HAD BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED, EVEN DURING DINNER, AND THEY HAD FINALLY
LEFT HIM TO HIS SLEEP IN A ROOM THAT WAS, IN TURN, INSIDE SOMETHING THAT
RESEMBLED A FORTRESS FOR THE DEPTH OF ITS SECURITY.

 

  WELL, AT LEAST HE DIDN'T HAVE TO FACE MINIATURIZATION. THERE WAS
ALWAYS THAT THOUGHT TO COMFORT HIM.

 

  THE DOOR SIGNAL FLASHED AND MORRISON REACHED OVER HIS HEAD, FEELING
THE BEDBOARD FOR THE BUTTON THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE ONE-WAY PATCH ON THE
DOOR. HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE THAT APPEARED AND PUSHED ANOTHER CONTACT
THAT ALLOWED THE DOOR TO BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE.

 

  TWO MEN ENTERED. THE ONE WHOSE FAMILIAR FACE HAD BEEN AT THE ONE-WAY
PATCH SAID, "YOU REMEMBER ME, I HOPE."

 

  MORRISON MADE NO MOVE TO GET OUT OF BED. HE WAS THE CENTER NOW AROUND
WHICH ALL REVOLVED, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY, AND HE WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THAT. HE SIMPLY RAISED HIS ARM IN CASUAL GREETING AND SAID, "YOU'RE THE
AGENT WHO WANTED ME TO GO TO THE SOVIET UNION. RODANO, ISN'T IT?"

 

  "FRANCIS RODANO, YES. AND THIS IS PROFESSOR ROBERT G. FRIAR. I IMAGINE
YOU KNOW HIM."

 

  MORRISON HESITATED AND THEN COURTESY SWUNG HIS FEET OFF THE BED AND
LIFTED HIM TO HIS FEET. "HELLO, PROFESSOR. I KNOW OF YOU, OF COURSE, AND
HAVE SEEN YOU ON HOLOVISION OFTEN ENOUGH. I'M PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR
PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE."

 

  FRIAR, ONE OF THE "VISIBLE SCIENTISTS" WHOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AND HV
APPEARANCES HAD MADE HIM FAMILIAR TO MOST OF THE WORLD, SMILED TIGHTLY.
HE HAD A ROUND FACE, PALE BLUE EYES, AN APPARENTLY PERMANENT VERTICAL
CREASE BETWEEN HIS EYEBROWS, RUDDY CHEEKS, A STURDY BODY OF AVERAGE
HEIGHT, AND A WAY OF LOOKING AROUND HIM RESTLESSLY.

 

  HE SAID, "YOU, I TAKE IT, ARE ALBERT JONAS MORRISON."

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT," SAID MORRISON EASILY. "MR. RODANO WILL VOUCH FOR ME.
PLEASE SIT DOWN, BOTH OF YOU, AND FORGIVE ME IF I CONTINUE TO RELAX ON
THE BED. I HAVE ABOUT A YEAR'S RELAXATION TO CATCH UP ON."

 

  THE TWO VISITORS SAT DOWN ON A LARGE COUCH AND LEANED TOWARD MORRISON.
RODANO SMILED A BIT TENTATIVELY. "I CAN'T PROMISE YOU MUCH RELAXATION,
DR. MORRISON. AT LEAST FOR A WHILE. INCIDENTALLY, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED
WORD FROM ASHBY. DO YOU REMEMBER HER?"

 

  "THE WAITRESS WHO TURNED THE TABLES? YES, INDEED. WITHOUT HER --"

 

  "WE KNOW THE ESSENTIALS OF THE STORY, MORRISON. SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOUR TWO FRIENDS HAVE RECOVERED AND ARE APPARENTLY FOND OF EACH
OTHER STILL."

 

  "AND ASHBY, HERSELF? SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS READY TO LEAVE IF WASHINGTON
THOUGHT IT BEST. I REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT."

 

  "YES, WE'LL GET HER OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. -- AND NOW I'M AFRAID WE
MUST BOTHER YOU AGAIN."

 

  MORRISON FROWNED. "HOW LONG WILL THIS KEEP UP?"

 

  "I DON'T KNOW. YOU MUST TAKE IT AS IT COMES. -- PROFESSOR FRIAR, WON'T
YOU TAKE OVER?"

 

  FRIAR NODDED. "DR. MORRISON, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE NOTES. -- NO, LET
ME REPHRASE THAT. I AM GOING TO TAKE NOTES, MORRISON."

 

  HE PLUCKED A SMALL COMPUTER KEYBOARD OF ADVANCED DESIGN OUT OF HIS
BRIEFCASE.

 

  RODANO SAID MILDLY, "WHERE WILL THESE NOTES GO, PROFESSOR?"

 

  "TO MY RECORDING DEVICE, MR. RODANO."

 

  "WHICH IS WHERE, PROFESSOR?"

 

  "IN MY OFFICE AT DEFENSE, MR. RODANO," THEN, WITH SOME IRRITATION
UNDER THE OTHER'S CONTINUING STARE, "INTO MY SAFE IN MY OFFICE AT
DEFENSE AND BOTH THE SAFE AND THE RECORDING DEVICE ARE WELL-CODED. DOES
THAT SATISFY YOU?"

 

  "PROCEED, PROFESSOR."

 

  FRIAR TURNED TO MORRISON AND SAID, "IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WERE
MINIATURIZED, MORRISON. YOU, PERSONALLY?"

 

  "I WAS. AT MY SMALLEST, I WAS THE SIZE OF AN ATOM WHILE PART OF A SHIP
THE SIZE OF A GLUCOSE MOLECULE. I SPENT BETTER THAN HALF A DAY INSIDE A
LIVING HUMAN BODY, FIRST IN THE BLOODSTREAM, THEN IN THE BRAIN."

 

  "AND THIS IS TRUE? NO CHANCE OF AN ILLUSION OR TRICKERY?"

 

  "PLEASE, PROFESSOR FRIAR. IF I WERE TRICKED OR HYPNOTIZED, MY
TESTIMONY NOW WOULD BE WORTHLESS. WE CAN'T PROCEED UNLESS YOU RECOGNIZE
THE FACT THAT I AM IN MY RIGHT MIND AND CAN BE RELIED ON TO REPORT
EVENTS THAT CORRESPOND REASONABLY WELL WITH REALITY."

 

  FRIAR'S LIPS PRESSED TOGETHER AND THEN HE SAID, "YOU ARE RIGHT. WE
MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS TO BEGIN WITH AND I WILL ASSUME YOU ARE SANE AND
RELIABLE -- WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO FURTHER RECONSIDERATION OF SUCH
ASSUMPTIONS."

 

  "OF COURSE," SAID MORRISON.

 

  "IN THAT CASE" -- AND FRIAR TURNED TO RODANO -- "WE BEGIN WITH ONE
GREAT AND IMPORTANT OBSERVATION. MINIATURIZATION IS POSSIBLE AND THE
SOVIETS DO INDEED HAVE IT AND MAKE USE OF IT AND CAN MINIATURIZE EVEN
LIVING HUMAN BEINGS WITHOUT APPARENT HARM TO THEM."

 

  HE TURNED BACK TO MORRISON. "PRESUMABLY, THE SOVIETS CLAIM TO
MINIATURIZE BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF PLANCK'S CONSTANT."

 

  "YES, THEY DO."

 

  "OF COURSE THEY DO. THERE'S NO OTHER CONCEIVABLE WAY OF DOING IT. DID
THEY EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE BY WHICH THAT WAS DONE?"

 

  "CERTAINLY NOT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SOVIETS
SCIENTISTS I DEALT WITH ARE AS SANE AS WE ARE. THEY WOULDN'T CARELESSLY
GIVE AWAY ANYTHING THEY DON'T WANT US TO KNOW."

 

  "VERY WELL, THEN. ASSUMPTION MADE. NOW TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU IN THE SOVIET UNION. DO NOT TELL IT AS AN ADVENTURE STORY, BUT
ONLY AS THE OBSERVATIONS OF A PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIST."

 

  MORRISON BEGAN TO TALK. HE WAS NOT ENTIRELY SORRY TO DO SO. HE WANTED
TO EXORCISE IT AND HE DIDN'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING THE ONLY
AMERICAN TO KNOW WHAT HE KNEW. HE TOLD THE STORY IN DETAIL AND IT TOOK
HOURS. HE DID NOT FINISH UNTIL THEY WERE SITTING AT A LUNCH DELIVERED BY
ROOM SERVICE.

 

  OVER DESSERT, FRIAR SAID, "LET ME SUMMARIZE, THEN, AS BEST I CAN FROM
MEMORY. TO BEGIN WITH, MINIATURIZATION DOES NOT AFFECT TIME FLOW, NOR
THE QUANTUM INTERACTIONS -- THAT IS, THE ELECTROMAGNETIC, WEAK AND
STRONG INTERACTIONS. THE GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION IS AFFECTED, HOWEVER,
AND DECREASES IN PROPORTION TO MASS, AS IT NATURALLY WOULD. IS THAT SO?"

 

  MORRISON NODDED.

 

  FRIAR WENT ON. "LIGHT -- AND ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, GENERALLY --
CAN CROSS INTO AND OUT OF THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD, BUT SOUND CANNOT.
NORMAL MATTER IS WEAKLY REPELLED BY THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD BUT, UNDER
PRESSURE, NORMAL MATTER CAN BE MADE TO ENTER IT AND BE ITSELF
MINIATURIZED, AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ENERGY OF THE FIELD."

 

  MORRISON NODDED AGAIN.

 

  FRIAR SAID, "THE MORE MINIATURIZED AN OBJECT BECOMES, THE LESS ENERGY
IS REQUIRED TO MINIATURIZE IT FURTHER. DO YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY
REQUIREMENT DECREASES IN PROPORTION TO THE MASS REMAINING AT ANY
PARTICULAR STAGE OF MINIATURIZATION?"

 

  "THAT WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM LOGICAL," SAID MORRISON, "BUT I DON'T
RECALL ANYONE MENTIONING THE QUANTITATIVE NATURE OF THAT PHENOMENON."

 

  "TO GO ON, THEN. THE MORE MINIATURIZED AN OBJECT, THE GREATER THE
CHANCE OF ITS SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION -- AND THAT REFERS TO THE
ENTIRE MASS WITHIN THE FIELD, RATHER THAN TO ANY COMPONENT PART. YOU, AS
A SEPARATED INDIVIDUAL, WERE MORE LIKELY TO DEMINIATURIZE SPONTANEOUSLY
THAN YOU WOULD AS PART OF THE SHIP. IS THAT RIGHT?"

 

  "THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING."

 

  "AND YOUR SOVIET COMPANIONS ADMITTED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
MAXIMIZE AND TO MAKE THINGS MORE MASSIVE THAN THEY ARE IN NATURE."

 

  "AGAIN, THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING. YOU MUST REALIZE, PROFESSOR FRIAR,
THAT I CAN ONLY REPEAT WHAT I WAS TOLD. THEY MIGHT HAVE DELIBERATELY
MISLED ME OR THEY MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG BECAUSE THEY HAD INSUFFICIENT
KNOWLEDGE THEMSELVES."

 

  "YES YES, I UNDERSTAND. DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THEY WERE
DELIBERATELY MISLEADING YOU?"

 

  "NO. IT SEEMED TO ME THEY WERE BEING HONEST."

 

  "WELL, PERHAPS. NOW, THE MOST INTERESTING THING TO ME IS THAT BROWNIAN
MOTION WAS IN BALANCE WITH MINIATURIZATION OSCILLATION AND THAT THE
GREATER THE DEGREE OF MINIATURIZATION, THE GREATER THE SHIFT IN BALANCE
TOWARD OSCILLATION AND AWAY FROM ORDINARY BROWNIAN MOTION."

 

  "THAT IS AN ACTUAL OBSERVATION OF MY OWN, PROFESSOR, AND DOESN'T REST
MERELY ON WHAT I WAS TOLD."

 

  "AND THAT SHIFT OF BALANCE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RATE OF
SPONTANEOUS DEMINIATURIZATION."

 

  "THAT IS MY OWN THOUGHT. I CANNOT STATE IT AS FACT."

 

  "HMM." FRIAR SIPPED THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS COFFEE AND SAID, "THE TROUBLE
IS THAT ALL THIS IS SUPERFICIAL. IT TELLS US ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
MINIATURIZATION FIELD, BUT NOTHING ABOUT HOW THE FIELD IS PRODUCED. --
AND IN DECREASING THE VALUE OF PLANCK'S CONSTANT, THEY LEAVE THE SPEED
OF LIGHT UNTOUCHED, YOU SAY?"

 

  "YES, BUT THAT, AS I EMPHASIZED, MEANS THAT MAINTAINING THE
MINIATURIZATION FIELD COSTS ENORMOUSLY IN ENERGY. IF THEY CAN COUPLE
PLANCK'S CONSTANT WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT, INCREASING THE LATTER AS THEY
DECREASE THE FORMER -- BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT YET."

 

  "SO THEY SAY. IT WAS IN SHAPIROV'S MIND, SUPPOSEDLY, BUT YOU WERE
UNABLE TO GET IT OUT."

 

  "THAT'S RIGHT."

 

  FRIAR REMAINED LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
"WE'LL GO OVER EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID AND DEDUCE WHAT WE CAN FROM IT,
BUT I FEAR IT WON'T HELP."

 

  "WHY NOT?" ASKED RODANO.

 

  "BECAUSE NONE OF IT GOES TO THE HEART. IF SOMEONE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A
ROBOT OR HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS WERE TO REPORT
A ROBOT IN OPERATION, HE COULD DESCRIBE HOW THE HEAD AND LIMBS MOVED,
HOW THE VOICE SOUNDED, HOW IT OBEYED ORDERS, AND SO ON. NOTHING HE COULD
OBSERVE WOULD TELL HIM HOW A POSITRONIC BRAINPATH WORKS OR WHAT A
MOLECULAR VALVE IS. HE WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE AN INKLING THAT EITHER
EXISTS, NOR WOULD THOSE SCIENTISTS WHO WOULD WORK FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS
HAVE ANY.

 

  "THE SOVIETS HAVE SOME TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE THE FIELD AND WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT IT, NOR DOES ANYTHING MORRISON CAN TELL US HELP US THERE.
THEY MIGHT HAVE PUBLISHED MATERIAL THAT LED UP TO IT, NOT AWARE THAT
SOMETHING CRUCIAL WAS IN THE MAKING -- THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY, WHEN EARLY WORK ON NUCLEAR FISSION WAS PUBLISHED
BEFORE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT IT OUGHT TO BE KEPT SECRET. THE SOVIETS
DIDN'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE WITH MINIATURIZATION, HOWEVER. NOR HAVE WE
SUCCEEDED IN RETRIEVING INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MATTER THROUGH
ESPIONAGE OR BY THE LUCK OF HAVING SOME KEY PERSONNEL ON THE OTHER SIDE
DEFECT AND COME TO US.

 

  "I WILL CONSULT WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD, BUT ON THE WHOLE, DR.
MORRISON, I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR ADVENTURE IN THE SOVIET UNION, HOWEVER
DARING AND PRAISEWORTHY HAS -- EXCEPT FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION THAT
MINIATURIZATION DOES EXIST -- BEEN USELESS. I'M SORRY, MR. RODANO, BUT
IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE HAPPENED."

 

  90.

 

  MORRISON'S EXPRESSION DID NOT CHANGE AS FRIAR ADVANCED HIS CONCLUSION.
HE POURED HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE COFFEE, ADDED CREAM JUDICIOUSLY, AND
DRANK IT WITHOUT HASTE.

 

  THEN HE SAID, "YOU'RE QUITE WRONG, YOU KNOW, FRIAR."

 

  FRIAR LOOKED UP AND SAID, "ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION OF THE MINIATURIZATION FIELD? YOU HAD
SAID THAT --"

 

  "WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, FRIAR, HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH
MINIATURIZATION. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH MY OWN WORK. THE SOVIETS
TOOK ME TO MALENKIGRAD AND THE GROTTO IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT USE MY
COMPUTER PROGRAM TO READ SHAPIROV'S MIND. IT FAILED AT THAT, WHICH IS
PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING, CONSIDERING THAT SHAPIROV WAS IN A COMA AND NEAR
DEATH. ON THE OTHER HAND, SHAPIROV, WHO HAD A REMARKABLY PENETRATING
MIND, REFERRED TO MY PROGRAM AS A 'RELAY STATION' AFTER HE HAD READ SOME
OF MY PAPERS. THAT'S WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE."

 

  "A RELAY STATION?" FRIAR'S FACE TOOK ON A LOOK OF PUZZLED DISTASTE.
"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"

 

  "INSTEAD OF TAPPING SHAPIROV'S THOUGHT, MY PROGRAMMED COMPUTER, ONCE
INSIDE ONE OF SHAPIROV'S NEURONS, WAS ACTING AS A RELAY, PASSING THOUGHT
FROM ONE OF US TO ANOTHER."

 

  FRIAR'S EXPRESSION BECAME ONE OF INDIGNATION. "YOU MEAN IT WAS A
TELEPATHIC DEVICE."

 

  "EXACTLY. I FIRST EXPERIENCED THAT WHEN I WAS AWARE OF AN INTENSE
EMOTION OF LOVE AND SEXUAL DESIRE FOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS ON THE
MINIATURIZED SHIP WITH ME. NATURALLY, I ASSUMED IT WAS MY OWN FEELING,
FOR SHE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. NEVERTHELESS, I WAS NOT AWARE OF
ANY CONSCIOUS FEELING OF THAT SORT. IT WAS NOT UNTIL SEVERAL OTHER
INSTANCES OF THE SORT THAT I REALIZED I WAS RECEIVING THE THOUGHTS OF A
YOUNG MAN ON BOARD SHIP. HE AND THE YOUNG LADY WERE ESTRANGED, BUT THE
PASSION BETWEEN THEM EXISTED, NEVERTHELESS."

 

  FRIAR SMILED TOLERANTLY. "ARE YOU SURE YOU WERE IN CONDITION, ON BOARD
THE SHIP, TO INTERPRET THESE THOUGHTS PROPERLY? AFTER ALL, YOU WERE
UNDER TENSION. DID YOU ALSO RECEIVE SIMILAR THOUGHTS FROM THE YOUNG
LADY?"

 

  "NO. THE YOUNG MAN AND I EXCHANGED THOUGHTS, INVOLUNTARILY, ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS. WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN, HE THOUGHT OF A WOMAN
AND TWO YOUNGSTERS. WHEN I WAS LOST IN THE BLOODSTREAM, IT WAS HE WHO
PICKED UP MY SENSATIONS OF PANIC. HE ASSUMED HE HAD DETECTED SHAPIROV'S
MISERIES BY WAY OF MY MACHINE -- WHICH REMAINED IN MY POSSESSION WHEN I
WAS ADRIFT -- BUT THOSE WERE MY FEELINGS, NOT SHAPIROV'S. I DID NOT
EXCHANGE THOUGHTS WITH EITHER WOMAN ON BOARD, BUT THEY EXCHANGED
THOUGHTS WITH EACH OTHER. WHEN THEY TRIED TO CATCH SHAPIROV'S THOUGHTS,
THEY DETECTED SIMILAR WORDS AND FEELINGS -- FROM EACH OTHER, OF COURSE
-- WHICH THE YOUNG MAN AND MYSELF DID NOT."

 

  "A SEXUAL DIFFERENCE?" SAID FRIAR SKEPTICALLY.

 

  "NOT REALLY. THE PILOT OF THE SHIP, A MALE, RECEIVED NOTHING AT ALL,
EITHER FROM THE WOMEN OR FROM THE OTHER MEN, THOUGH ON ONE OCCASION, HE
DID SEEM TO GET A THOUGHT. I COULDN'T SAY FROM WHOM. MY OWN FEELING IS
THAT THERE ARE BRAIN TYPES, AS THERE ARE BLOOD TYPES -- PROBABLY ONLY A
FEW -- AND THAT TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION CAN BE MOST EASILY ESTABLISHED
AMONG THOSE OF THE SAME BRAIN TYPE."

 

  RODANO INTERPOSED SOFTLY, "EVEN IF ALL THIS IS SO, DR. MORRISON. WHAT
OF IT?"

 

  MORRISON SAID, "LET ME EXPLAIN THAT. FOR YEARS I'VE WORKED TO IDENTIFY
THE REGIONS AND PATTERNS OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN WITH
SOME UNREMARKABLE SUCCESS. OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD CATCH AN IMAGE, BUT I
NEVER INTERPRETED THAT PROPERLY. I THOUGHT IT WAS COMING FROM THE ANIMAL
ON WHOSE BRAIN I WAS WORKING, BUT I NOW SUSPECT THAT THEY CAME WHEN I
WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO SOME HUMAN BEING WHO WAS IN THE GRIP OF STRONG
EMOTION OR DEEP THOUGHT. I NEVER NOTICED THAT. MY FAULT.

 

  "NEVERTHELESS, HAVING BEEN STUNG BY THE GENERAL INDIFFERENCE AND
DOWNRIGHT DISBELIEF AND RIDICULE OF MY COLLEAGUES, I NEVER PUBLISHED THE
MATTER OF CATCHING IMAGES, BUT MODIFIED MY PROGRAM IN AN ATTEMPT TO
INTENSIFY IT. SOME OF THOSE MODIFICATIONS WERE NEVER PUBLISHED, EITHER.
THUS, I ENTERED SHAPIROV'S BLOODSTREAM WITH A DEVICE THAT COULD MORE
NEARLY SERVE AS A TELEPATHIC RELAY THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER HAD BEFORE.
AND NOW THAT, AT LAST, MY THICK HEAD HAS ABSORBED EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
THAT I HAVE, I KNOW WHAT TO DO TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM. I AM SURE OF
THAT."

 

  FRIAR SAID, "LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, MORRISON. YOU ARE TELLING ME
THAT, AS A RESULT OF YOUR FANTASTIC VOYAGE INTO SHAPIROV'S BODY, YOU ARE
NOW CERTAIN YOU CAN SO MODIFY YOUR DEVICE AS TO MAKE TELEPATHY
PRACTICAL?"

 

  "PRACTICAL TO AN EXTENT. YES."

 

  "THAT WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS THING -- IF YOU COULD DEMONSTRATE IT." THE
SKEPTICISM IN FRIAR'S VOICE DID NOT DISAPPEAR.

 

  "MORE ENORMOUS THAN YOU PERHAPS THINK," SAID MORRISON WITH SOME
ASPERITY. "YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THAT TELESCOPES, WHETHER OPTICAL OR
RADIO, CAN BE BUILT IN PARTS OVER A WIDE AREA AND, IF THEY ARE
COORDINATED BY COMPUTER, CAN ACHIEVE THE FUNCTION OF A SINGLE LARGE
TELESCOPE, ONE MUCH LARGER THAN CAN PRACTICALLY BE BUILT IN A SINGLE
PIECE."

 

  "YES. BUT WHAT OF THAT?"

 

  "I MENTION IT AS AN ANALOGY. I AM CONVINCED THAT I CAN DEMONSTRATE
SOMETHING OF THE SAME SORT IN CONNECTION WITH THE BRAIN. IF WE WERE TO
HAVE SIX MEN UNITED TELEPATHICALLY, THE SIX BRAINS WOULD, FOR THE TIME,
ACT AS ONE LARGE BRAIN AND, IN FACT, BE BEYOND HUMAN IN INTELLIGENCE AND
IN THE CAPACITY FOR INSIGHT. THINK OF THE ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE MADE, ADVANCES IN OTHER FIELDS OF HUMAN
ENDEAVOR AS WELL. WE WOULD, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE TEDIUM OF PHYSICAL
EVOLUTION OR THE DANGER OF GENETIC ENGINEERING, CREATE A MENTAL
SUPERMAN."

 

  "INTERESTING, IF TRUE," SAID FRIAR, OBVIOUSLY INTRIGUED AND AS
OBVIOUSLY UNCONVINCED.

 

  "THERE IS A CATCH, THOUGH," SAID MORRISON. "I PERFORMED ALL MY
EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS, PLACING LEADS FROM MY COMPUTER INTO THE BRAIN.
THAT WAS -- AND AS I SEE NOW, MUST BE -- NOT AT ALL PRECISE. NO MATTER
HOW WE REFINE IT, WE WILL HAVE ONLY A CRUDE TELEPATHIC SYSTEM AT BEST.
WHAT WE NEED IS TO INVADE A BRAIN AND PLACE A MINIATURIZED AND PROPERTY
PROGRAMMED COMPUTER IN A NEURON, WHERE IT CAN ACT AS A RELAY. THE
TELEPATHIC PROCESS WILL THEN BE SHARPENED ENORMOUSLY."

 

  "AND THE POOR PERSON ON WHOM YOU INFLICT THIS DAMAGE," SAID FRIAR,
"WILL EVENTUALLY EXPLODE WHEN THE DEVICE DEMINIATURIZES."

 

  "AN ANIMAL BRAIN IS MUCH INFERIOR TO THE HUMAN BRAIN," SAID MORRISON
EARNESTLY, "BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE ANIMAL BRAIN HAS FEWER NEURONS,
LESS INTRICATELY ORDERED. THE INDIVIDUAL NEURON IN A RABBIT'S BRAIN MAY,
HOWEVER, NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY INFERIOR TO A HUMAN NEURON. A ROBOT COULD
BE USED AS A RELAY."

 

  RODANO SAID, "AMERICAN BRAINS WORKING IN TANDEM COULD, THEN, WORK OUT
THE SECRET OF MINIATURIZATION AND PERHAPS EVEN BEAT THE SOVIETS AT THE
TASK OF COUPLING PLANCK'S CONSTANT TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT."

 

  "YES," SAID MORRISON ENTHUSIASTICALLY, "AND ONE SOVIET SCIENTIST, YURI
KONEV, WHO WAS THE SHIPMATE WHO SHARED THOUGHTS WITH ME, CAUGHT ON TO
THIS, AS I DID. IT WAS FOR THAT REASON THAT HE TRIED TO HOLD ON TO ME
AND TO MY PROGRAM IN DEFIANCE OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT. WITHOUT ME AND MY
PROGRAM, I DOUBT THAT HE CAN DUPLICATE MY WORK FOR A LONG TIME, PERHAPS
NOT FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS NOT REALLY HIS FIELD."

 

  "CONTINUE," SAID RODANO. "I'M BEGINNING TO GET A FEELING FOR THIS."

 

  MORRISON SAID, "THIS IS THE SITUATION, THEN. RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT A
KIND OF CRUDE TELEPATHY. EVEN WITHOUT MINIATURIZATION, IT MAY HELP US
FORGE AHEAD OF THE SOVIETS, BUT IT MAY NOT. WITHOUT MINIATURIZATION --
AND WITHOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROPERLY PROGRAMMED COMPUTER IN AN
ANIMAL NEURON AS A RELAY -- WE CAN'T BE SURE OF ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING.

 

  "THE SOVIETS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE A CRUDE FORM OF MINIATURIZATION.
THEY MAY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF INVESTIGATION, FIND A WAY OF LINKING
QUANTUM THEORY AND RELATIVITY THEORY TO MAKE A TRULY EFFICIENT
MINIATURIZATION DEVICE, BUT THAT MIGHT TAKE A VERY LONG TIME.

 

  "SO IF WE HAVE TELEPATHY BUT NOT MINIATURIZATION, AND IF THEY HAVE
MINIATURIZATION BUT NOT TELEPATHY, IT MAY BE THAT WE MAY WIN AFTER A
LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- OR THEY MAY WIN. THE NATION THAT WINS HAS, IN A
SENSE, AN UNLIMITED SPEED OF TRAVEL AND THE UNIVERSE WILL BELONG TO IT.
THAT NATION THAT LOSES WILL WITHER -- OR AT LEAST ITS INSTITUTIONS WILL
WITHER. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US IF WE WIN THE RACE, BUT IT IS THEY WHO
MAY WIN AND THE PROCESS OF RACING MAY FORCE THE BREAKDOWN OF TWO
GENERATIONS OF AN UNEASY PEACE AND LEAD TO AN ALLDESTRUCTIVE WAR.

 

  "ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE AND THE SOVIETS ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER
AND, BOTH OF US, TO USE TELEPATHY AS REFINED AND STRENGTHENED BY A
MINIATURIZED RELAY STATION IN A LIVING NEURON, WE MAY ACHIEVE, IN
COMBINATION AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME, WHAT AMOUNTS TO ANTIGRAVITY AND
INFINITE SPEED. THE UNIVERSE WILL BELONG TO BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND
THE SOVIET UNION; INDEED, TO THE WHOLE GLOBE, TO EARTH, TO HUMANITY.

 

  "WHY NOT, GENTLEMEN? NO ONE WOULD LOSE. EVERYONE WOULD GAIN."

 

  FRIAR AND RODANO STARED AT HIM IN WONDER. FRIAR FINALLY SAID,
SWALLOWING HARD, "YOU MAKE IT SOUND GOOD, IF INDEED YOU HAVE TELEPATHY."

 

  "DO YOU HAVE THE TIME TO LISTEN TO MY EXPLANATION?"

 

  "I HAVE ALL THE TIME YOU WANT," SAID FRIAR.

 

  IT TOOK SOME HOURS FOR MORRISON TO EXPLAIN HIS THEORY IN DETAIL. THEN
HE LEANED BACK AND SAID, "IT'S ALMOST DINNERTIME. NOW I KNOW THAT YOU --
AND OTHERS AS WELL -- WILL BE WANTING TO INTERVIEW ME AND THAT YOU WILL
ALL WANT ME TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHICH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICALITY
OF TELEPATHY AND THAT THAT WILL KEEP ME BUSY FOR -- WELL, FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE, FOR ALL I KNOW, BUT I MUST HAVE ONE THING NOW."

 

  "WHAT'S THAT?" ASKED RODANO.

 

  "SOME TIME OFF TO BEGIN WITH. PLEASE. I'VE GONE THROUGH ENOUGH. GIVE
ME TWENTY-FOUR HOURS -- FROM NOW UNTIL DINNERTIME TOMORROW. LET ME READ,
EAT, THINK, REST, AND SLEEP. JUST ONE DAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND, AND
THEREAFTER I WILL BE AT YOUR SERVICE."

 

  "FAIR ENOUGH," SAID RODANO, RISING. "I WILL ARRANGE THAT IF I CAN AND
I SUSPECT I CAN. THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IS YOURS. MAKE THE MOST OF IT. I
AGREE THAT YOU'LL HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE TIME TO YOURSELF THEREAFTER. AND
FROM NOW ON, FOR QUITE A WHILE, RESIGN YOURSELF TO BEING THE MOST
STRICTLY GUARDED PERSON IN AMERICA, NOT EXCLUDING THE PRESIDENT."

 

  "GOOD," SAID MORRISON. "I'LL CALL FOR A DINNER FOR ONE."

 

  91.

 

  RODANO AND FRIAR HAD FINISHED THEIR OWN DINNER. IT HAD BEEN AN
UNUSUALLY SILENT MEAL IN AN ISOLATED AND GUARDED ROOM.

 

  ONCE IT WAS OVER, RODANO SAID, "TELL ME, DR. FRIAR, DO YOU THINK
MORRISON IS RIGHT IN THIS MATTER OF TELEPATHY?"

 

  FRIAR SIGHED AND SAID CAUTIOUSLY, "I WILL HAVE TO CONSULT WITH SOME OF
MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE CONCERNING THE BRAIN THAN I AM,
BUT I FEEL HE IS RIGHT. HE IS VERY CONVINCING. -- AND NOW I HAVE A
QUESTION FOR YOU?"

 

  "YES?"

 

  "DO YOU THINK MORRISON WAS CORRECT AS TO THE NECESSITY OF COOPERATION
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION IN THIS MATTER?"

 

  THERE WAS A LENGTHY PAUSE AND FINALLY RODANO SAID, "YES, I THINK HE'S
RIGHT THERE, TOO. OF COURSE, THERE'LL BE HOWLS FROM EVERY DIRECTION, BUT
WE CAN'T RISK THE SOVIETS GETTING THERE FIRST. EVERYONE WILL SEE THAT.
THEY'LL HAVE TO."

 

  "AND THE SOVIETS? WILL THEY SEE IT, TOO?"

 

  "THEY'LL HAVE TO, ALSO. THEY CAN'T RISK US GETTING THERE FIRST.
BESIDES, THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL UNDOUBTEDLY GET WIND OF WHAT IS
GOING ON AND THEY WILL CLAMOR FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION AND DEMAND THAT
NO NEW COLD WAR BE STARTED. IT MAY TAKE SOME YEARS, BUT IN THE END WE
WILL COOPERATE."

 

  RODANO THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID, "BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY
STRIKES ME AS PECULIAR, PROFESSOR FRIAR?"

 

  FRIAR SAID, "WHAT IN THIS WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS CAN POSSIBLY STRIKE
YOU AS NOT PECULIAR?"

 

  "NOTHING, I SUPPOSE, BUT WHAT STRIKES ME AS MOST PECULIAR IS THIS. I
MET MORRISON LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON TO URGE HIM TO GO TO THE SOVIET
UNION. AT THE TIME, MY HEART SANK. HE STRUCK ME AS A MAN WITHOUT GUTS,
AS A ZERO, AS A WIMP, AS SOMEONE WHO WASN'T EVEN BRIGHT EXCEPT IN AN
ACADEMIC SENSE. I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD BE RELIED ON TO ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING. I WAS SIMPLY SENDING HIM TO HIS DEATH. SO I THOUGHT -- AND SO
I SAID TO A COLLEAGUE THE NEXT DAY -- AND, SO HELP ME, SO I STILL THINK.
HE'S NOTHING AND IT'S SIMPLY A MIRACLE THAT HE SURVIVED AND THAT'S ONLY
THANKS TO OTHERS. AND YET --"

 

  "AND YET?"

 

  "AND YET HE RETURNED, HAVING MADE AN INCREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY
AND HAVING SET IN MOTION A PROCESS WHEREBY THE UNITED STATES AND THE
SOVIET UNION WILL BOTH BE FORCED, AGAINST THEIR SEPARATE WILLS, TO
COOPERATE. AND, TO TOP IT OFF, HE HAS MADE HIMSELF THE MOST IMPORTANT
AND, ONCE WE PUBLICIZE THESE EVENTS, THE MOST FAMOUS SCIENTIST IN THE
WORLD -- POSSIBLY OF ALL TIME.

 

  "HE HAS, IN A SENSE, DESTROYED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE WORLD AND
BUILT A NEW ONE -- OR AT LEAST INITIATED THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A NEW
ONE -- AND HE HAS DONE IT ALL BETWEEN THE AFTERNOON OF LAST SUNDAY AND
THE AFTERNOON OF TODAY, SATURDAY. HE HAS DONE IT IN SIX DAYS. SOMEHOW
THAT'S A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT."

 

  FRIAR LEANED BACK AND LAUGHED ALOUD. "IT'S MORE FRIGHTENING THAN YOU
THINK. HE PLANS TO REST ON THE SEVENTH DAY."
