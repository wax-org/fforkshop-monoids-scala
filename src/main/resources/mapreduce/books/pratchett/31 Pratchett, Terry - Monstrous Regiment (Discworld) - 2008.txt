_‘Trousers. That’s the secret ... Put on trousers and the world changes.
We walk different. We act different. I see these girls and I think:
idiots! Get yourself some trousers!’_

Women belong in the kitchen – everyone knows that. Not in jobs, pubs or
indeed trousers, and certainly not on the front line, braving enemy
forces in defence of their country. Then again, there’s always a war on
somewhere, even if no-one really knows what it’s about. And when money
and enthusiasm for it are running very low, it might be time to let
women make a stand, on the battlefield and for their rights ...

Polly cut off her hair in front of the mirror, feeling slightly guilty
about not feeling very guilty about doing so. It was supposed to be her
crowning glory, and everyone said it was beautiful, but she generally
wore it in a net when she was working. She’d always told herself it was
wasted on her. But she was careful to see that the long golden coils all
landed on the small sheet spread out for the purpose.

If she would _admit_ to any strong emotion at all at this time, it was
sheer annoyance that a haircut was all she needed to pass for a young
man. She didn’t even need to bind up her bosom, which she’d heard was
the normal practice. Nature had seen to it that she had barely any
problems in this area.

The effect that the scissors had was . . . erratic, but it was no worse
than other male haircuts here. It’d do. She did feel cold on the back of
her neck, but that was only partly because of the loss of her long hair.
It was also because of the Stare.

The Duchess watched her from above the bed.

It was a poor woodcut, hand-coloured mostly in blue and red. It was of a
plain, middle-aged woman whose sagging chin and slightly bulging eyes
gave the cynical the feeling that someone had put a large fish in a
dress, but the artist had managed to capture something extra in that
strange, blank expression. Some pictures had eyes that followed you
around the room; this one looked right through you. It was a face you
found in every home. In Borogravia, you grew up with the Duchess
watching you.

Polly knew her parents had one of the pictures in their room, and knew
also that when her mother was alive she used to curtsy to it every
night. She reached up and turned this picture round so that it faced the
wall. A thought in her head said _No_. It was overruled. She’d made up
her mind.

Then she dressed herself in her brother’s clothes, tipped the contents
of the sheet into a small bag which went into the bottom of her pack
along with the spare clothes, put the note on her bed, picked up the
pack and climbed out of the window. At least, Polly climbed out of the
window, but it was Oliver’s feet that landed lightly on the ground.

Dawn was just turning the dark world into monochrome when she slipped
across the inn’s yard. The Duchess watched her from the inn sign, too.
Her father had been a great loyalist, at least up to the death of her
mother. The sign hadn’t been repainted this year, and a random
bird-dropping had given the Duchess a squint.

Polly checked that the recruiting sergeant’s cart was still in front of
the bar, its bright banners now drab and heavy with last night’s rain.
By the look of that big fat sergeant, it would be hours before it was on
the road again. She had plenty of time. He looked like a slow
breakfaster.

She let herself out of the door in the back wall and headed uphill. At
the top, she turned back and looked at the waking town. Smoke was rising
from a few chimneys, but since Polly was always the first to wake, and
had to yell the maids out of their beds, the inn was still sleeping. She
knew that the Widow Clambers had stayed overnight (it had been ‘raining
too hard for her to go home’, according to Polly’s father) and,
personally, she hoped for his sake that she’d stay every night. The town
had no shortage of widows, and Eva Clambers was a warm-hearted lady who
baked like a champion. His wife’s long illness and Paul’s long absence
had taken a lot out of her father. Polly was glad some of it was being
put back. The old ladies who spent their days glowering from their
windows might spy and peeve and mumble, but they had been doing that for
too long. No one listened any more.

She raised her gaze. Smoke and steam was already rising from the laundry
of the Girls’ Working School. It hung over one end of the town like a
threat, big and grey with tall, thin windows. It was always silent. When
she was small, she’d been told that that was where the Bad Girls went.
The nature of ‘badness’ was not explained, and at the age of five Polly
had received the vague idea that it consisted of not going to bed when
you were told. At the age of eight she’d learned it was where you were
lucky not to go for buying your brother a paint box. She turned her back
and set off between the trees, which were full of birdsong.

Forget you were ever Polly. _Think_ young male, that was the thing. Fart
loudly and with self-satisfaction at a job well done, move like a puppet
that’d had a couple of random strings cut, never hug anyone and, if you
meet a friend, punch them. A few years working in the bar had provided
plenty of observational material. No problem about not swinging her
hips, at least. Nature had been pretty sparing there, too.

And then there was the young male walk to master. At least women swung
only their _hips_. Young men swung _everything_, from the shoulders
down. You have to try to occupy a lot of space, she thought. It makes
you look bigger, like a tomcat fluffing his tail. She’d seen it a lot in
the inn. The boys tried to walk big in self-defence against all those
other big boys out there. I’m bad, I’m fierce, I’m cool, I’d like a pint
of shandy and me mam wants me home by nine . . .

Let’s see, now . . . arms out from the body as though holding a couple
of bags of flour . . . check. Shoulders swaying as though she was
elbowing her way through a crowd . . . check. Hands slightly bunched and
making rhythmical circling motions as though turning two independent
handles attached to the waist . . . check. Legs moving forward loosely
and ape-like . . . check . . .

It worked fine for a few yards until she got something wrong and the
resultant muscular confusion somersaulted her into a holly bush. After
that, she gave up.

The thunderstorm came back as she hurried along the trail; sometimes one
would hang around the mountains for days. But at least up here the path
wasn’t a river of mud, and the trees still had enough leaves to give her
some protection. There was no time to wait out the weather, anyway. She
had a long way to go. The recruiting party would cross at the ferry, but
Polly was known to all the ferrymen by sight and the guard would want to
see her permit to travel, which Oliver Perks certainly didn’t have. So
that meant a long diversion all the way to the troll bridge at Tübz. To
the trolls all humans looked alike and any piece of paper would do as a
permit, since they didn’t read. Then she could walk down through the
pine forests to Plün. The cart would have to stop there for the night,
but the place was one of those nowhere villages that existed only in
order to avoid the embarrassment of having large empty spaces on the
map. No one knew her in Plün. No one ever went there. It was a dump.

It was, in fact, just the place she needed. The recruiting party would
stop there, and she could enlist. She was pretty certain the big fat
sergeant and his greasy little corporal wouldn’t notice the girl who’d
served them last night. She was not, as they said, conventionally
beautiful. The corporal _had_ tried to pinch her bottom, but probably
out of habit, like swatting a fly, and there was not enough for a big
pinch, at that.

She sat on the hill above the ferry and had a late breakfast of cold
potato and sausage while she watched the cart cross over. No one was
marching behind it. No lads had been recruited back in Munz this time.
People had kept away. Too many young men had left over the last few
years, and not enough had come back. And, of the ones who’d come back,
sometimes not enough of each man had come back. The corporal could bang
his big drum all he liked. Munz was running out of sons almost as fast
as it accumulated widows.

The afternoon hung heavy and humid, and a yellow pine warbler followed
her from bush to bush. Last night’s mud was steaming when Polly reached
the troll bridge, which crossed the river in a narrow gorge. It was a
thin, graceful affair, put together, it was said, with no mortar at all.
And it was said that the weight of the bridge anchored it ever more
deeply into the rock on either side. It was said to be a wonder of the
world, except that very few people around here ever wondered much about
anything and were barely aware of the world. It cost one penny to cross,
or one hundred gold pieces if you had a billygoat.¹ Halfway across Polly
peered over the parapet and saw the cart far, far below, working its way
along the narrow road just above the white water.

The afternoon’s journey was downhill all the way, through dark pines on
this side of the gorge. She didn’t hurry and, towards sunset, she
spotted the inn. The cart had already arrived, but by the looks of it
the recruiting sergeant had not even bothered to make an effort. There
was no drum-banging like there had been last night, no cries of ‘Roll
up, my young shavers! It’s a great life in the Ins-and-Outs!’

_There was always a war._ Usually it was a border dispute, the national
equivalent of complaining that the neighbour was letting his hedge grow
too long. Sometimes it was bigger. Borogravia was a peace-loving country
in the midst of treacherous, devious, warlike enemies. They had to be
treacherous, devious and warlike, otherwise we wouldn’t be fighting
them, eh? There was always a war.

Polly’s father had been in the army before he took over The Duchess from
Polly’s grandfather. He didn’t talk about it much. He’d brought his
sword back with him, but instead of hanging it over the fireplace he
used it to poke the fire. Sometimes old friends would turn up and, when
the bars were shut for the night, they’d gather round the fire and drink
and sing. The young Polly found excuses to stay up and listen to the
songs they sang, but that had stopped when she’d got into trouble for
using one of the more interesting words in front of her mother; now she
was older, and served the beer, it was presumably assumed that she knew
the words or would find out what they meant soon enough. Besides, her
mother had gone where bad words would no longer offend and, in theory,
never got said.

The songs had been part of her childhood. She knew all the words of ‘The
World Turned Upside Down’ and ‘The Devil Shall Be My Sergeant’ and
‘Johnny Has Gone For A Soldier’ and ‘The Girl I Left Behind Me’ and,
after the drink had been flowing for a while, she’d memorized ‘Colonel
Crapski’ and ‘I Wish I’d Never Kissed Her’.

And then, of course, there had been ‘Sweet Polly Oliver’. Her father
used to sing it when she was small and fretful or sad, and she’d laughed
to hear it simply because it had her name in it. She was word perfect on
the words before she’d known what most of them meant. And now . . .

. . . Polly pushed open the door. The recruiting sergeant and his
corporal looked up from the stained table where they were sitting, beer
mugs halfway to their lips. She took a deep breath, marched over, and
made an attempt at saluting.

‘What do you want, kid?’ growled the corporal.

‘Want to join up, sir!’

The sergeant turned to Polly and grinned, which made his scars move
oddly and caused a tremor to shake all his chins. The word ‘fat’ could
not honestly be applied to him, not when the word ‘gross’ was lumbering
forward to catch your attention. He was one of those people who didn’t
have a waist. He had an equator. He had gravity. If he fell over, in any
direction, he would rock. Sun and drink had burned his face red. Small
dark eyes twinkled in the redness like the sparkle on the edge of a
knife. Beside him, on the table, were a couple of old-fashioned
cutlasses, weapons that had more in common with a meat cleaver than a
sword.

‘Just like that?’ he said.

‘Yessir!’

‘Really?’

‘Yessir!’

‘You don’t want us to get you stinking drunk first? It’s traditional,
you know.’

‘Nosir!’

‘I haven’t told you about the wonderful opportunities for advancement
and good fortune, have I?’

‘Nosir!’

‘Did I mention how the spanking red uniform will mean you’ll have to
beat the girls off with a stick?’

‘Don’t think so, sir!’

‘Or the grub? Every meal’s a banquet when you march along with us!’ The
sergeant smacked his belly, which caused tremors in outlying regions.
‘I’m the living proof!’

‘Yes, sir. No, sir. I just want to join up to fight for my country and
the honour of the Duchess, sir!’

‘You do?’ said the corporal incredulously, but the sergeant appeared not
to hear this. He looked Polly up and down, and Polly got the definite
impression that the man was neither as drunk nor as stupid as he looked.

‘Upon my oath, Corporal Strappi, it seems that what we’ve got ourselves
here is nothin’ less than a good, old-fashioned _patriot_,’ he said, his
eyes searching Polly’s face. ‘Well, you’ve come to the right place, my
lad!’ He pulled a sheaf of papers towards him with an air of bustle.
‘You know who we are?’

‘The Tenth Foot, sir. Light infantry, sir. Known as the “Ins-and-Outs”,
sir,’ said Polly, relief bubbling through her. She’d clearly passed some
sort of test.

‘Right, lad. The jolly old Cheesemongers. Finest regiment there is, in
the finest army in the world. Keen to join, then, are yer?’

‘Keen as mustard, sir!’ said Polly, aware of the corporal’s suspicious
eyes on her.

‘Good lad!’

The sergeant unscrewed the top from a bottle of ink and dipped a nib pen
in it. His hand hovered over the paperwork. ‘Name, lad?’ he said.

‘Oliver, sir. Oliver Perks,’ said Polly.

‘Age?’

‘Seventeen come Sunday, sir.’

‘Yeah, right,’ said the sergeant. ‘You’re seventeen and I’m the Grand
Duchess Annagovia. What’re you running away from, eh? Got a young lady
in the family way?’

‘’e’d ’ave ’ad to ’ave ’elp,’ said the corporal, grinning. ‘He squeaks
like a little lad.’

Polly realized she was starting to blush. But then, young Oliver would
blush too, wouldn’t he? It was very easy to make a boy blush. Polly
could do it just by staring.

‘Don’t matter anyway,’ said the sergeant. ‘You make your mark on this
here document and kiss the Duchess and you’re _my_ little lad, you
understand? My name is Sergeant Jackrum. I will be your mother and your
father and Corporal Strappi here will be just like your big brother. And
life will be steak and bacon every day, and anyone who wants to drag you
away’ll have to drag me away too, because I’ll be holding on to your
collar. And you might well be thinking there’s no one that can drag that
much, Mr Perks.’ A thick thumb jabbed at the paper. ‘Just there, right?’

Polly picked up the pen and signed.

‘What’s that?’ said the corporal.

‘My signature,’ said Polly.

She heard the door open behind her, and spun round. Several young men—
she corrected herself, several _other_ young men had clattered into the
bar, and were looking around warily.

‘You can read and write, too?’ said the sergeant, glancing up at them
and then back to her. ‘Yeah, I see. A nice round hand, as well. Officer
material, you are. Give him the shilling, corporal. And the picture, of
course.’

‘Right, sergeant,’ said Corporal Strappi, holding up a picture frame on
a handle, like a looking-glass.

‘’Pucker up, Private Parts.’

‘It’s Perks, sir,’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, right. Now kiss the Duchess.’

It was not a good copy of the famous picture. The painting behind the
glass was faded and something, some kind of moss or something, was
growing on the inside of the cracked glass itself. Polly let her lips
brush it while holding her breath.

‘Huh,’ said Strappi, and pressed something into her hand.

‘What’s this?’ said Polly, looking at the small square of paper.

‘An IOU. Bit short of shillings right now,’ said the sergeant, while
Strappi smirked. ‘But the innkeeper’ll stand you a pint of ale, courtesy
of her grace.’

He turned and looked up at the newcomers. ‘Well, it never rains but it
pours. You boys here to join up too? My word, and we didn’t even have to
bang the drum. It must be Corporal Strappi’s amazin’ charisma. Step up,
don’t be shy. Who’s the next likely lad?’

Polly looked at the next recruit with horror that she hoped she was
concealing. She hadn’t really noticed him in the gloom, because he was
wearing black – not cool, styled black, but a dusty black, the kind of
suit people got buried in. By the look of it, that person had been him.
There were cobwebs all over it. The boy himself had stitches across his
forehead.

‘Your name, lad?’ said Jackrum.

‘Igor, thur.’

Jackrum counted the stitches.

‘You know, I had a feeling it was going to be,’ he said. ‘And I see
you’re eighteen.’

‘_Awake!_’

‘Oh, gods . . .’ Commander Samuel Vimes put his hands over his eyes.

‘I beg your pardon, your grace?’ said the Ankh-Morpork consul to
Zlobenia. ‘Are you ill, your grace?’

‘What’s your name again, young man?’ said Vimes. ‘I’m sorry, but I’ve
been travelling for two weeks and not getting a lot of sleep and I’ve
spent all day being introduced to people with difficult names. That’s
bad for the brain.’

‘It’s Clarence, your grace. Clarence Chinny.’

‘Chinny?’ said Vimes, and Clarence read everything in his expression.

‘I’m afraid so, sir,’ he said. ‘Were you a good fighter at school?’ said
Vimes. ‘No, your grace, but no one could beat me over the
one-hundred-yard dash.’

Vimes laughed. ‘Well, Clarence, any national anthem that starts “Awake!”
is going to lead to trouble. They didn’t teach you this in the
Patrician’s office?’

‘Er . . . no, your grace,’ said Chinny.

‘Well, you’ll find out. Carry on, then.’

‘Yes, sir.’ Chinny cleared his throat. ‘The Borogravian National
Anthem,’ he announced, for the second time.

‘Awake _sorry, your grace_, ye sons of the Motherland!

Taste no more the wine of the sour apples

Woodsmen, grasp your choppers!

Farmers, slaughter with the tool formerly used for lifting beets the
foe!

Frustrate the endless wiles of our enemies

We into the darkness march singing

Against the whole world in arms coming

But see the golden light upon the mountain tops!

The new day is a great big fish!’

‘Er . . .’ Vimes said. ‘That last bit . . . ?’

‘That is a literal translation, your grace,’ said Clarence nervously.
‘It means something like “an amazing opportunity” or “a glittering
prize”, your grace.’

‘When we’re not in public, Clarence, “sir” will do. “Your grace” is just
to impress the natives.’ Vimes slumped back in his uncomfortable chair,
chin in his hand, and then winced.

‘Two thousand three hundred miles,’ he said, shifting his position. ‘And
it’s freezing on a broomstick, however low they fly. And then the barge,
and then the coach . . .’ He winced again. ‘I read your report. Do you
think it’s possible for an entire nation to be insane?’

Clarence swallowed. He’d been told that he was talking to the second
most powerful man in Ankh-Morpork, even if the man himself acted as
though he was ignorant of the fact. His desk in this chilly tower room
was rickety; it had belonged to the head janitor of the Kneck garrison
until yesterday. Paperwork cluttered its scarred surface and was stacked
in piles behind Vimes’s chair.

Vimes himself did not look, to Clarence, like a duke. He looked like a
watchman which, in fact, Clarence understood, he was. This offended
Clarence Chinny. People at the top should look as though they belonged
there.

‘That’s a very . . . interesting question, sir,’ he said. ‘You mean the
people—’

‘Not the people, the nation,’ said Vimes. ‘Borogravia looks off its
head, to me, from what I’ve read. I expect the people just do the best
they can and get on with raising their kids which, I might say, I’d
rather be doing right now, too. Look, you know what I mean. You take a
bunch of people who don’t seem any different from you and me, but when
you add them all together you get this sort of huge raving maniac with
national borders and an anthem.’

‘It’s a fascinating idea, sir,’ said Clarence diplomatically.

Vimes looked round the room. The walls were bare stone. The windows were
narrow. It was damn cold, even on a sunny day. All that bad food, and
that bumping about and sleeping on bad beds . . . and all that
travelling in the dark, too, on dwarf barges in their secret canals
under the mountains – the gods alone knew what intricate diplomacy Lord
Vetinari had pulled off to get _that_, although the Low King owed Vimes
a few favours . . .

. . . all of that for this cold castle over this cold river between
these stupid countries, with their stupid war. He knew what he wanted to
do. If they’d been people, scuffling in the gutter, he’d have known what
to do. He’d have banged their heads together and maybe shoved them in
the cells overnight. You couldn’t bang countries together.

Vimes picked up some paperwork, fiddled with it, and threw it down
again. ‘To hell with this,’ he said. ‘What’s happening out there?’

‘I understand there are a few pockets of resistance in some of the more
inaccessible areas of the keep, but they are being dealt with. For all
practical purposes the keep is in our hands. That was a clever ruse of
yours, your gr— sir.’

Vimes sighed. ‘No, Clarence, it was a dull old ruse. It should not be
possible to get men into a fortress dressed as washerwomen. Three of
them had moustaches, for goodness’ sake!’

‘The Borogravians are rather . . . old-fashioned about things like that,
sir. On that subject, we appear to have zombies in the lower crypts.
Dreadful things. A lot of high-ranking Borogravian military men were
interred down there over the centuries, apparently.’

‘Really? What are they doing now?’

Clarence raised his eyebrows. ‘Lurching, sir, I think. Groaning. Zombie
things. Something seems to have stirred them up.’

‘Us, probably,’ said Vimes. He got up, strode across the room, and
pulled open the big heavy door. ‘Reg!’ he yelled.

After a moment another watchman appeared, and saluted. He was
grey-faced, and Clarence couldn’t help noticing when the man saluted
that the hand and fingers were held together with stitching.

‘Have you met Constable Shoe, Clarence?’ said Vimes cheerfully. ‘One of
my staff. Been dead for more than thirty years, and loves every minute
of it, eh, Reg?’

‘Right, Mister Vimes,’ said Reg, grinning and revealing a lot of brown
teeth.

‘Some fellow countrymen of yours down in the cellar, Reg.’

‘Oh, dear. Lurching, are they?’

‘’fraid so, Reg.’

‘I shall go and have a word with them,’ said Reg. He saluted again and
marched out, with a hint of lurch.

‘He’s, er, from here?’ said Chinny, who had gone quite pale.

‘Oh, no. The _undiscovered_ country,’ said Vimes. ‘He’s dead. However,
credit where it’s due, he hasn’t let that stop him. You didn’t know we
have a zombie in the Watch, Clarence?’

‘Er . . . no, sir. I’ve haven’t been back to the city in five years.’ He
swallowed. ‘I gather things have changed.’

Horribly so, in Clarence Chinny’s opinion. Being consul to Zlobenia had
been an easy job, which left him a lot of time to get on with his
business. And then the big semaphore towers marched through, all along
the valley, and suddenly Ankh-Morpork was an hour away. Before the
clacks, a letter from Ankh-Morpork would take more than two weeks to get
to him, and so no one worried if he took a day or two to answer it. Now
people expected a reply overnight. He’d been quite glad when Borogravia
had destroyed several of those wretched towers. And then all hell had
been let loose.

‘We’ve got all sorts in the Watch,’ said Vimes. ‘And we bloody well need
’em now, Clarence, with Zlobenians and Borogravians scrapping in the
streets over some damn quarrel that began a thousand years ago. It’s
worse than dwarfs and trolls! All because someone’s
great-to-the-power-of-umpteen-grandmother slapped the face of someone’s
great-ditto-uncle! Borogravia and Zlobenia can’t even agree a border.
They chose the river, and that changes course every spring. Suddenly the
clacks towers are now on Borogravian soil – or mud, anyway – so the
idiots burn them down for religious reasons.’

‘Er, there is more to it than that, sir,’ said Chinny.

‘Yes, I know. I read the history. The annual scrap with Zlobenia is just
the local derby. Borogravia fights everybody. Why?’

‘National pride, sir.’

‘What in? There’s nothing there! There’s some tallow mines, and they’re
not bad farmers, but there’s no great architecture, no big libraries, no
famous composers, no very high mountains, no wonderful views. All you
can say about the place is that it isn’t anywhere else. What’s so
special about Borogravia?’

‘I suppose it’s special because it’s theirs. And of course there’s
Nuggan, sir. Their god. I’ve brought you a copy of the _Book of
Nuggan_.’

‘I looked through one back in the city, Chinny,’ said Vimes. ‘Seemed
pretty stu—’

‘That wouldn’t have been a recent edition, sir. And I suspect it
wouldn’t be, er, very current that far from here. This one is more up to
date,’ said Chinny, putting a small but thick book on the desk.

‘Up to date? What do you mean, up to date?’ said Vimes, looking puzzled.
‘Holy writ gets . . . written. Do this, don’t do that, no coveting your
neighbour’s ox . . .’

‘Um . . . Nuggan doesn’t just leave it at that, sir. He, er . . .
updates things. Mostly the Abominations, to be frank.’

Vimes took the new copy. It was noticeably thicker than the one he’d
brought with him.

‘It’s what they call a Living Testament,’ Chinny explained. ‘They –
well, I suppose you could say they “die” if they’re taken out of
Borogravia. They no longer . . . get added to. The latest Abominations
are at the end, sir,’ said Chinny helpfully.

‘This is a holy book with an appendix?’

‘Exactly, sir.’

‘In a _ring binder_?’

‘Quite so, sir. People put blank pages in and the Abominations . . .
turn up.’

‘You mean magically?’

‘I suppose I mean religiously, sir.’

Vimes opened a page at random. ‘Chocolate?’ he said. ‘He doesn’t like
chocolate?’

‘Yes, sir. That’s an Abomination.’

‘Garlic? Well, I don’t much like that, so fair enough . . . cats?’

‘Oh, yes. He really doesn’t like cats, sir.’

‘_Dwarfs?_ It says here “The dwarfish race which worships Gold is an
Abomination unto Nuggan”! He must be mad. What happened there?’

‘Oh, the dwarfs that were here sealed their mines and vanished, your
grace.’

‘I bet they did. They know trouble when they see it,’ said Vimes. He let
‘your grace’ pass this time; Chinny clearly derived some satisfaction
from talking to a duke.

He leafed through the pages, and stopped. _‘The colour blue?’_

‘Correct, sir.’

‘What’s abominable about the colour blue? It’s just a colour! The _sky_
is blue!’

‘Yes, sir. Devout Nugganites try not to look at it these days. Um . . .’
Chinny had been trained as a diplomat. Some things he didn’t like to say
directly. ‘Nuggan, sir . . . um . . . is rather . . . tetchy,’ he
managed.

‘Tetchy?’ said Vimes. ‘A _tetchy_ god? What, he complains about the
noise their kids make? Objects to loud music after nine p.m.?’

‘Um . . . we get the _Ankh-Morpork Times_ here, sir, eventually, and,
er, I’d say, er, that Nuggan is very much like, er, the kind of people
who write to its letter column. You know, sir. The kind who sign their
letters “Disgusted of Ankh-Morpork” . . .’

‘Oh, you mean he really _is_ mad,’ said Vimes.

‘Oh, I’d never mean anything like that, sir,’ said Chinny hurriedly.

‘What do the priests do about this?’

‘Not a lot, sir. I think they quietly ignore some of the more, er,
extreme Abominations.’

‘You mean Nuggan objects to dwarfs, cats and the colour blue and
there’re more insane commandments?’

Chinny coughed politely.

‘All right, then,’ growled Vimes. ‘More extreme commandments?’

‘Oysters, sir. He doesn’t like them. But that’s not a problem because no
one there has ever seen an oyster. Oh, and babies. He Abominated them,
too.’

‘I take it people still make them here?’

‘Oh, yes, your gr— I’m sorry. Yes, sir. But they feel guilty about it.
Barking dogs, that was another one. Shirts with six buttons, too. And
cheese. Er . . . people just sort of, er, _avoid_ the trickier ones.
Even the priests seem to have given up trying to explain them.’

‘Yes, I think I can see why. So what we have here is a country that
tries to run itself on the commandments of a god who, the people feel,
may be wearing his underpants on his head. Has he Abominated
underpants?’

‘No, sir,’ Chinny sighed. ‘But it’s probably only a matter of time.’

‘So how do they manage?’

‘These days, people mostly pray to the Duchess Annagovia. You see icons
of her in every house. They call her the Little Mother.’

‘Ah, yes, the Duchess. Can I get to see her?’

‘Oh, no one sees her, sir. No one except her servants has seen her for
more than thirty years. To be honest, sir, she’s probably dead.’

‘Only probably?’

‘No one really knows. The official story is that she’s in mourning. It’s
rather sad, sir. The young Duke died a week after they got married.
Gored by a wild pig during a hunt, I believe. She went into mourning at
the old castle at PrinceMarmadukePiotreAlbertHans
JosephBernhardtWilhelmsberg and hasn’t appeared in public since. The
official portrait was painted when she was about forty, I believe.’

‘No children?’

‘No, sir. On her death, the line is extinct.’

‘And they pray to her? Like a god?’

Chinny sighed. ‘I _did_ put this in my briefing notes, sir. The royal
family in Borogravia have always had a quasi-religious status, you see.
They’re the head of the church and the peasants, at least, pray to them
in the hope that they’ll put in a good word with Nuggan. They’re like
. . . living saints. Celestial intermediaries. To be honest, that’s how
these countries work in any case. If you want something done, you have
to know the right people. And I suppose it’s easier to pray to someone
in a picture than to a god you can’t see.’

Vimes sat looking at the consul for some time. When he next spoke, he
frightened the man to his boots.

‘Who’d inherit?’ he said.

‘Sir?’

‘Just following the monarchy, Mr Chinny. If the Duchess isn’t on the
throne, who should be?’

‘Um, it’s incredibly complex, sir, because of the intermarriages and the
various legal systems, which for example—’

‘Who’s the smart money on, Mr Chinny?’

‘Um, Prince Heinrich of Zlobenia.’

To Chinny’s astonishment Vimes laughed. ‘And he’s wondering how auntie’s
gettin’ on, I expect. I met him this morning, didn’t I? Can’t say I took
to him.’

‘But he is a friend of Ankh-Morpork,’ said Chinny reproachfully. ‘That
was in my report. Educated. Very interested in the clacks. Got great
plans for his country. They used to be Nugganatic in Zlobenia, but he’s
banned the religion and, frankly, hardly anyone objected. He wants
Zlobenia to move forward. He admires Ankh-Morpork very much.’

‘Yes, I know. He sounds almost as insane as Nuggan,’ said Vimes. ‘Okay,
so what we’ve probably got is an elaborate charade to keep Heinrich out.
How’s this place governed?’

‘There isn’t much. A bit of tax collecting, and that’s about all. We
think some of the senior court officials just drift on as if the Duchess
was alive. The only thing that really works is the army.’

‘All right, how about coppers? Everyone needs coppers. At least they
have their feet on the ground.’

‘I believe informal citizens’ committees enforce Nugganatic law,’ said
Chinny.

‘Oh, gods. Prodnoses, curtain-twitchers and vigilantes,’ said Vimes. He
stood up and peered out through the narrow window at the plain below. It
was night-time. Cooking-fires in the enemy camp made demonic
constellations in the darkness.

‘Did they tell you why I’ve been sent here, Clarence?’ he said.

‘No, sir. My instructions were that you would, um, oversee things.
Prince Heinrich is not very happy about it.’

‘Oh, well, the interests of Ankh-Morpork are the interests of all
money-lov— oops, sorry, all _freedom_-loving people everywhere,’ said
Vimes. ‘We can’t have a country that turns back our mail coaches and
keeps cutting down the clacks towers. That’s _expensive_. They’re
cutting the continent in half, they’re the pinch in the hourglass. I’m
to bring things to a “satisfactory” conclusion. And frankly, Clarence,
I’m wondering if it’s even worth attacking Borogravia. It’ll be cheaper
to sit here and wait for it to explode. Although I notice . . . where
was that report . . . ah, yes . . . it will starve first.’

‘Regrettably so, sir.’

Igor stood mutely in front of the recruiting table.

‘Don’t often see you people these days,’ said Jackrum.

‘Yeah, run out of fresh brains, ’ave yer?’ said the corporal nastily.

‘Now then, corporal, no call for that,’ said the sergeant, leaning back
in his creaking chair. ‘There’s plenty of lads out there walking around
on legs they wouldn’t still have if there hadn’t been a friendly Igor
around, eh, Igor?’

‘Yeah? Well, _I_ heard about people waking up and findin’ their friendly
Igor had whipped out their brains in the middle of the night and
buggered off to flog ’em,’ said the corporal, glaring at Igor.

‘I promith you your brain ith entirely thafe from me, corporal,’ said
Igor. Polly started to laugh, and stopped when she realized absolutely
no one else was doing so.

‘Yeah, well, I met a sergeant who said an Igor put a man’s legs on
_backwards_,’ said Corporal Strappi. ‘What good’s that to a soldier,
eh?’

‘Could advance and retreat at the thame time?’ said Igor levelly.
‘Thargent, I know all the thtorieth, and they are nothing but vile
calumnieth. I theek only to therve my country. I do not want trouble.’

‘Right,’ said the sergeant. ‘Nor do we. Make your mark, and you’ve got
to promise not to mess about with Corporal Strappi’s brain, right?
_Another_ signature? My word, I can see we’ve got ourselves a bleedin’
_college_ of recruits today. Give him his cardboard shilling, corporal.’

‘Thank you,’ said Igor. ‘And I would like to give the picture a wipe, if
it’th all the thame to you.’ He produced a small cloth.

‘Wipe it?’ said Strappi. ‘Is that allowed, sergeant?’

‘What do you want to wipe it for, mister?’ said Jackrum.

‘To remove the invithible demonth,’ said Igor.

‘I can’t see any invis—’ Strappi began, and stopped.

‘Just let him, all right?’ said Jackrum. ‘It’s one of their funny little
ways.’

‘Dun’t seem right,’ muttered Strappi. ‘Practically treason . . .’

‘Can’t see why it’d be wrong just to give the old girl a wash,’ said the
sergeant shortly. ‘Next. Oh . . .’

Igor, after carefully wiping the stained picture and giving it a
perfunctory peck, came and stood next to Polly, giving her a sheepish
grin. But she was watching the next recruit.

He was short and quite slim, which was fairly usual in a country where
it was rare to get enough food to make you fat. But he was dressed in
black and expensively, like an aristocrat; he even had a sword. The
sergeant was, therefore, looking worried. Clearly a man could get into
trouble talking wrong to a nob who might have important friends.

‘You sure you’ve come to the right place, sir?’ he said.

‘Yes, sergeant. I wish to enlist.’

Sergeant Jackrum shifted uneasily. ‘Yes, sir, but I’m not sure a
gentleman like you—’

‘Are you going to enlist me or not, sergeant?’

‘Not usual for a _gentleman_ to enlist as a common soldier, sir,’
mumbled the sergeant.

‘What you mean, sergeant, is: is anyone after me? Is there a price on my
head? And the answer is no.’

‘How about a mob with pitchforks?’ said Corporal Strappi. ‘He’s a bloody
_vampire_, sarge! Anyone can see that! He’s a Black Ribboner! Look, he’s
got the badge!’

‘Which says “Not One Drop”,’ said the young man calmly. ‘Not one drop of
human blood, sergeant. A prohibition I have accepted for almost two
years, thanks to the League of Temperance. Of course, if you have a
personal objection, sergeant, you only need to give it to me in
writing.’

Which was quite a clever thing to say, Polly thought. Those clothes cost
serious money. Most of the vampire families were highly nobby. You never
knew who was connected to who . . . not just connected to who, in fact,
but to whom. Whoms were likely to be far more trouble than your common
everyday who. The sergeant was looking down a mile of rough road.

‘Got to move with the times, corporal,’ he said, deciding not to go
there. ‘And we certainly need the men.’

‘Yeah, but s’posin’ he wants to suck all my blood out in the middle of
the night?’ said Strappi.

‘Well, he’ll just have to wait until Private Igor’s finished looking for
your brain, won’t he?’ snapped the sergeant. ‘Sign here, mister.’

The pen scratched on the paper. After a minute or two the vampire turned
the paper over and continued writing on the other side. Vampires had
long names.

‘But you can call me Maladict,’ he said, dropping the pen back in the
inkwell.

‘Thank you very much, I must say, si— private. Give him the shilling,
corporal. Good job it’s not a silver one, eh? Haha!’

‘Yes,’ said Maladict. ‘It is.’

‘Next!’ said the sergeant. Polly watched as a farm boy, breeches held up
with string, shuffled in front of the table and looked at the quill pen
with the resentful perplexity of those confronted with new technology.

She turned back to the bar. The landlord glared at her in the manner of
bad landlords everywhere. As her father always said, if you kept an inn
you either liked people or went mad. Oddly enough, some of the mad ones
were the best at looking after their beer. But by the smell of the
place, this wasn’t one of those.

She leaned on the bar. ‘Pint, please,’ she said, and watched glumly as
the man gave a scowl of acknowledgement and turned to the big barrels.
It’d be sour, she knew, with the slop bucket under the tap tipped back
in every night, and the spigot not put back, and . . . yes, it was going
to be served in a leather tankard that had probably never been washed.

A couple of new recruits were already knocking back their pints, though,
with every audible sign of enjoyment. But this was Plün, after all.
Anything that made you forget you were there was probably worth
drinking.

One of them said, ‘Lovely pint, this, eh?’ and the boy next to him
belched and said, ‘Best I’ve tasted, yeah.’

Polly sniffed at the tankard. The contents smelled like something she
wouldn’t feed to pigs. She took a sip, and completely changed her
opinion. She _would_ feed it to pigs. Those lads have never tasted beer
before, she told herself. It’s like dad said. Out in the country there’s
lads who’d join up for an uninhabited pair of breeches. And they’ll
drink this muck and pretend to enjoy it like men, hey up, we supped some
stuff last night, eh, lads? And then next thing—

Oh, lor’ . . . that reminded her. What’d the privy be like here? The
men’s one out in the yard back at home was bad enough. Polly sloshed two
big pails of water into it every morning while trying not to breathe.
There was weird green moss growing on the slate floor. And The Duchess
was a good inn. It had customers who took their boots off before going
to bed.

She narrowed her eyes. This stupid fool in front of her, a man making
one long eyebrow do the work of two, was serving them slops and foul
vinegar just before they marched off to war—

‘Thith beer,’ said Igor, on her right, ‘tathteth of horthe pith.’

Polly stood back. Even in a bar like this, that was killing talk.

‘Oh, you’d know, would you?’ said the barman, looming over the boy.
‘Drunk horse piss, have you?’

‘Yeth,’ said Igor.

The barman stuck a fist in front of Igor’s face. ‘Now you listen to me,
you lisping little—’

A slim black arm appeared with amazing speed and a pale hand caught the
man’s wrist. The one eyebrow contorted in sudden agony.

‘Now, it’s like this,’ said Maladict calmly. ‘We’re soldiers of the
Duchess, agreed? Just say “aargh”.’

He must have squeezed. The man groaned.

‘Thank you. And you’re serving up as beer a liquid best described as
foul water,’ Maladict went on in the same level, conversational tone.
‘I, of course, don’t drink . . . horse piss, but I have a highly
developed sense of smell, and really would prefer not to list aloud the
things I can smell in this murk, so we’ll just say “rat droppings” and
leave it at that, shall we? Just whimper. Good man.’ At the end of the
bar, one of the new recruits threw up. The barman’s fingers had gone
white. Maladict nodded with satisfaction.

‘Incapacitating a soldier of her grace in wartime is a treasonable
offence,’ he said. He leaned forward. ‘Punishable, of course, by . . .
death.’ Maladict pronounced the word with a certain delight. ‘_However_,
if there happened to be another barrel of beer around the place, you
know, good stuff, the stuff you’d keep for your friends if you had any
friends, then I’m sure we can forget this little incident. Now, I’m
going to let go of your wrist. I can tell by your eyebrow that you are a
thinker, and if you’re thinking of rushing back in here with a big
stick, I’d like you to think about _this_ instead: I’d like you to think
about this black ribbon I’m wearing. Know what it means, do you?’

The barman winced, and mumbled: ‘Temp’rance League . . .’

‘Right! Well done!’ said Maladict. ‘And one more thought for you, if
you’ve got room. I’ve only taken a pledge not to drink human blood. It
doesn’t mean I can’t kick you in the fork so hard you suddenly go deaf.’

He released his grip. The barman slowly straightened up. Under the bar
he _would_ have a short wooden club, Polly knew. Every bar had one. Even
her father had one. It was a great help, he said, in times of worry and
confusion. She saw the fingers of the usable hand twitch.

‘Don’t,’ she said. ‘I think he means it.’

The barman relaxed. ‘Bit of a misunderstanding there, gents,’ he
mumbled. ‘Got the wrong barrel in. No offence meant.’ He shuffled off,
his hand almost visibly throbbing.

‘I only thaid it wath horthe pith,’ said Igor.

‘He won’t cause trouble,’ said Polly to Maladict. ‘He’ll be your friend
from now on. He’s worked out he can’t beat you so he’s going to be your
best mate.’

Maladict subjected her to a thoughtful stare. ‘_I_ know that,’ he said.
‘How do you?’

‘I used to work in an inn,’ said Polly, feeling her heart begin to beat
faster, as it always did when the lies lined up. ‘You learn to read
people.’

‘What did you do in the inn?’

‘Barman.’

‘There’s another inn in this hole, is there?’

‘Oh no, I’m not from round here.’

Polly groaned at the sound of her own voice, and waited for the
question: ‘Then why come here to join up?’ It didn’t come. Instead,
Maladict just shrugged and said, ‘I shouldn’t think anyone is from round
here.’

A couple more new recruits arrived at the bar. They had the same look –
sheepish, a bit defiant, in clothes that didn’t fit well. Eyebrow
reappeared with a small keg, which he laid reverentially on a stand and
gently tapped. He pulled a genuine pewter tankard from under the bar,
filled it, and timorously proffered it to Maladict.

‘Igor?’ said the vampire, waving it away.

‘I’ll thtick with the horthe pith, if it’th all the thame to you,’ said
Igor. He looked around in the sudden silence. ‘Look, I never thaid I
didn’t _like_ it,’ said Igor. He pushed his mug across the sticky bar.
‘Thame again?’

Polly took the new tankard and sniffed at it. Then she took a sip. ‘Not
bad,’ she said. ‘At least it tastes like it’s—’

The door pushed open, letting in the sounds of the storm. About
two-thirds of a troll eased its way inside, and then managed to get the
rest of itself through.

Polly was okay about trolls. She met them up in the woods sometimes,
sitting amongst the trees or purposefully lumbering along the tracks on
the way to whatever it was trolls did. They weren’t friendly, they were
. . . resigned. The world’s got humans in it, live with it. They’re not
worth the indigestion. You can’t kill ’em all. Step around ’em. Stepping
on ’em doesn’t work in the long term.

Occasionally a farmer would hire one to do some heavy work. Sometimes
they turned up, sometimes they didn’t. Sometimes they’d turn up, lumber
around a field pulling out tree stumps as if they were carrots, and then
wander off without waiting to be paid. A lot of things humans did
mystified trolls, and vice versa. Generally, they avoided one another.

But she didn’t often see trolls as . . . trollish as this one. It looked
like a boulder that had spent centuries in the damp pine forests. Lichen
covered it. Stringy grey moss hung in curtains from its head and its
chin. It had a bird’s nest in one ear. It had a genuine troll club, made
from an uprooted sapling. It was almost a joke troll, except that no one
would laugh.

The root end of the sapling bumped across the floor as the troll,
watched by the recruits and a horrified Corporal Strappi, trudged to the
table.

‘Gonna En List,’ it said. ‘Gonna do my bit. Gimme shillin’.’

‘You’re a troll!’ Strappi burst out.

‘Now, now, none of that, corporal,’ said Sergeant Jackrum. ‘Don’t ask,
don’t tell.’

‘Don’t ask? Don’t _ask_? It’s a troll, sarge! It’s got crags! There’s
grass growing under its fingernails! It’s a troll!’

‘Right,’ said the sergeant. ‘Enlist him.’

‘You want to fight with us?’ Strappi squeaked. Trolls had no sense of
personal space, and a ton of what was, for practical purposes, a kind of
rock was looming right over the table.

The troll analysed the question. The recruits stood in silence, mugs
halfway to mouths.

‘No,’ said the troll at last. ‘Gonna fight wi’ En Army. Gods save the
. . .’ The troll paused, and looked at the ceiling. Whatever it was
seeking there didn’t appear to be visible. Then it looked at its feet,
which had grass growing on them. Then it looked at its free hand and
moved its fingers as if counting something. ‘. . . Duchess,’ it said. It
had been a long wait. The table creaked as the troll laid a hand on it,
palm upwards. ‘Gimme shillin’.’

‘We’ve only got the bits of pape—’ Corporal Strappi began. Sergeant
Jackrum jabbed an elbow into his ribs.

‘Upon my oath, are you mad?’ he hissed. ‘There’s a ten-man bounty for
enlisting a troll!’ With his other hand he reached into his jacket
pocket, pulled out a real silver shilling, and placed it delicately in
the huge hand. ‘Welcome to your new life, friend! I’ll just write your
name down, shall I? What is it?’

The troll looked at ceiling, feet, sergeant, wall and table. Polly saw
its lips move. ‘Carborundum?’ it volunteered.

‘Yeah, probably,’ said the sergeant. ‘Er, how’d you like to shav— to cut
off some of that hai— moss? We’ve got a, a sort of a . . . regulation
. . .’

Wall, floor, ceiling, table, fingers, sergeant. ‘No,’ said Carborundum.

‘Right. Right. Right,’ said the sergeant quickly. ‘It’s not a regulation
as per such, actually, it’s more of an advisory. Silly one, too, eh?
I’ve always thought so. Glad to have you with us,’ he added fervently.

The troll licked the coin, which gleamed like a diamond in its hand. It
actually did have grass growing under its fingernails too, Polly
noticed. Then Carborundum trudged to the bar. The crowd parted
instantly, because trolls _never_ had to stand at the back of the press
of bodies, waving money and trying to catch the barman’s eye.

He broke the coin in two and dropped both halves on the bar top. Eyebrow
swallowed. He looked as though he would have said ‘Are you sure?’ except
that this was not a question barmen addressed to people weighing over
half a ton. Carborundum thought for a while, and then said: ‘Gimme
drink.’

Eyebrow nodded, disappeared briefly into the room behind the bar, and
came back holding a double-handled mug. Maladict sneezed. Polly’s eyes
watered. It was the kind of smell you sense with your teeth. The pub
might make foul beer as a matter of course, but _this_ was eye-stinging
vinegar.

Eyebrow dropped one half of the silver coin into it, and then took a
copper penny out of the money drawer and held it over the fuming mug.
The troll nodded. With just a hint of ceremony, like a cocktail waiter
dropping the little umbrella into a Double Entendre, Eyebrow let the
copper fall.

More bubbles welled up. Igor watched with interest. Carborundum picked
the mug up in two fingers of each shovel-like hand, and swallowed the
contents in one gulp. He stood stock still for a moment, then carefully
put the mug back on the bar.

‘You gentlemen might like to move back a bit,’ murmured Eyebrow.

‘What’s going to happen?’ said Polly.

‘It takes ’em all differently,’ said Eyebrow. ‘Looks like this one’s –
no, there he goes . . .’

With considerable style, Carborundum went over backwards. There was no
sagging at the knees, no girly attempt to soften the fall. He just went
from standing up, one hand out, to lying down, one hand up. He even
rocked gently for some time after hitting the floor.

‘Got no head for his drink,’ said Eyebrow. ‘Typical of the young bucks.
Wants to play the big troll, comes in here, orders an Electrick
Floorbanger, doesn’t know how to handle it.’

‘Is he going to come round?’ said Maladict.

‘No, that’s it until dawn, I reckon,’ said Eyebrow. ‘Brain stops
working.’

‘Shouldn’t affect _him_ too much, then,’ said Corporal Strappi, stepping
up. ‘Right, you miserable lot. You’re sleeping in the shed out the back,
understand? Practically waterproof, hardly any rats. We’re out of here
at dawn! You’re in the army now!’

Polly lay in the dark, on a bed of musty straw. There was no question of
anyone’s getting undressed. The rain hammered on the roof and the wind
blew through a crack under the door, despite Igor’s attempt to stuff it
with straw. There was some desultory conversation, during which Polly
found that she was sharing the dank shed with ‘Tonker’ Halter, ‘Shufti’
Manickle, ‘Wazzer’ Goom and ‘Lofty’ Tewt. Maladict and Igor didn’t seem
to have acquired repeatable nicknames. She’d become Ozzer by general
agreement.

Slightly to Polly’s surprise the boy now known as Wazzer had taken a
small picture of the Duchess out of his pack and had nervously hung it
on an old nail. No one else said anything as he prayed to it. It was
what you were supposed to do.

_They said the Duchess was dead_ . . .

Polly had been washing up when she’d heard the men talking late one
night, and it’s a poor woman who can’t eavesdrop while making a noise at
the same time.

Dead, they said, but the people up at
PrinceMarmadukePiotreAlbertHansJoseph-BernhardtWilhelmsberg weren’t
admitting it. That was ’cos what with there being no children, and with
royalty marrying one another’s cousins and grannies all the time, the
ducal throne would go to Prince Heinrich of Zlobenia! There! Can you
believe that? That’s why we never see her, right? And there hasn’t been
a new picture all these years? Makes you think, eh? Oh, they _say_ she’s
been in mourning ’cos of the young Duke, but that was more’n seventy
years ago! They _say_ she was buried in secret and—

At which point her father had stopped the speaker dead. There are some
conversations where you don’t even want people to remember you were in
the same room.

Dead or alive, the Duchess watched over you.

The recruits tried to sleep.

Occasionally, someone belched or expelled wind noisily, and Polly
responded with a few fake eructations of her own. That seemed to inspire
greater effort on the part of the other sleepers, to the point where the
roof rattled and dust fell down, before everyone subsided. Once or twice
she heard people stagger out into the windy darkness, in theory for the
privy but probably, given male impatience in these matters, to aim much
closer to home. Once, coasting in and out of a troubled dream, she
thought she heard someone sobbing.

Taking care not to rustle too much, Polly pulled out the much-folded,
much-read, much-stained last letter from her brother, and read it by the
light of the solitary, guttering candle. It had been opened and heavily
mangled by the censors, and bore the stamp of the Duchy. It read:

Dear all,

We are in [image] which is [image] with a [image] big thing with knobs.
On [image] we will [image] which is just as well because [image] out of.
I am keeping well. The food is [image] we’ll [image] at the [image] but
my mate [image] er says not to worry, it’ll be all over by [image] and
we shall all have medals.

Chins up!

Paul

It was in a careful hand, the excessively clear and well-shaped writing
of someone who has to think about every letter. She slowly folded it up
again. Paul had wanted medals, because they were shiny. That’d been
almost a year ago, when any recruiting party that came past went away
with the best part of a battalion, and there had been people waving them
off with flags and music. Sometimes, now, smaller parties of men came
back. The lucky ones were missing only one arm or one leg. There were no
flags.

She unfolded another piece of paper. It was a pamphlet. It was headed
‘From the Mothers of Borogravia!’ The mothers of Borogravia were very
definite about wanting to send their sons off to war against the
Zlobenian Aggressor and used a great many exclamation marks to say so.
And this was odd, because the mothers in Munz had not seemed keen on the
idea of their sons going off to war, and positively tried to drag them
back. Several copies of the pamphlet seemed to have reached every home,
even so. It was very patriotic. That is, it talked about killing
foreigners.

Polly had learned to read and write after a fashion because the inn was
big and it was a business and things had to be tallied and recorded. Her
mother had taught her to read, which was acceptable to Nuggan, and her
father made sure that she learned how to write, which was not. A woman
who could write was an Abomination unto Nuggan, according to Father
Jupe; anything she wrote would by definition be a lie.

But Polly had learned anyway because Paul hadn’t, at least to the
standard needed to run an inn as busy as The Duchess. He could read if
he could run his finger slowly along the lines, and he wrote letters at
a snail’s pace, with a lot of care and heavy breathing, like a man
assembling a piece of jewellery. He was big and kind and slow and could
lift beer kegs as though they were toys, but he wasn’t a man at home
with paperwork. Their father had hinted to Polly, very gently but very
often, that Polly would need to be right behind him when the time came
for him to run The Duchess. Left to himself, with no one to tell him
what to do next, her brother just stood and watched birds.

At Paul’s insistence, she’d read the whole of ‘From the Mothers of
Borogravia!’ to him, including the bits about heroes and there being no
greater good than to die for your country. She wished, now, she hadn’t
done that. Paul did what he was told. Unfortunately, he believed what he
was told, too.

Polly put the papers away and dozed again, until her bladder woke her
up. Oh, well, at least at this time of the morning she’d have a clear
run. She reached out for her pack and stepped as softly as she could out
into the rain.

It was mostly just coming off the trees now, which were roaring in the
wind that blew up the valley. The moon was hidden in the clouds, but
there was just enough light to make out the inn’s buildings. A certain
greyness suggested that what passed for dawn in Plün was on the way. She
located the men’s privy which, indeed, stank of inaccuracy.

A lot of planning and practice had gone into this moment. She was helped
by the design of the breeches, which were the old-fashioned kind with
generous buttoned trapdoors, and also by the experiments she’d made very
early in the mornings when she was doing the cleaning. In short, with
care and attention to detail, she’d found that a woman could pee
standing up. It certainly worked back home in the inn’s privy, which had
been designed and built in the certain expectation of the aimlessness of
the customers.

The wind shook the dank building. In the dark she thought of Auntie
Hattie, who’d gone a bit strange round her sixtieth birthday and
persistently accused passing young men of looking up her dress. She was
even worse after a glass of wine, and she had one joke: ‘What does a man
stand up to do, a woman sit down to do and a dog lift its leg to do?’
And then, when everyone was too embarrassed to answer, she’d
triumphantly shriek, ‘Shake hands!’ and fall over. Auntie Hattie was an
Abomination all by herself.

Polly buttoned up the breeches with a sense of exhilaration. She felt
she’d crossed a bridge, a sensation that was helped by the realization
that she’d kept her feet dry.

Someone said, ‘Psst!’

It was just as well she’d already taken a leak. Panic instantly squeezed
every muscle. Where were they hiding? This was just a rotten old shed!
Oh, there were a few cubicles, but the smell alone suggested very
strongly that the woods outside would be a much better proposition. Even
on a wild night. Even with extra wolves.

‘Yes?’ she quavered, and then cleared her throat and demanded, with a
little more gruffness: ‘_Yes?_’

‘You’ll need these,’ whispered the voice. In the fetid gloom she made
out something rising over the top of a cubicle. She reached up nervously
and touched softness. It was a bundle of wool. Her fingers explored it.

‘A pair of _socks_?’ she said.

‘Right. Wear ’em,’ said the mystery voice hoarsely.

‘Thank you, but I’ve brought several pairs . . .’ Polly began.

There was a faint sigh. ‘No. Not on your feet. Shove ’em down the front
of your trousers.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘Look,’ said the whisperer patiently, ‘you don’t bulge where you
shouldn’t bulge. That’s good. But you don’t bulge where you should
bulge, either. You know? Lower down?’

‘Oh! Er . . . I . . . but . . . I didn’t think people noticed . . .’
said Polly, glowing with embarrassment. She’d been spotted! But there
was no hue and cry, no angry quotations from the _Book of Nuggan_.
Someone was _helping_. Someone who had _seen_ her . . .

‘It’s a funny thing,’ said the voice, ‘but they notice what’s missing
more than they notice what’s there. Just one pair, mark you. Don’t get
ambitious.’

Polly hesitated. ‘Um . . . is it obvious?’ she said.

‘No. That’s why I gave you the socks.’

‘I _meant_ that . . . that I’m not . . . that I’m . . .’

‘Not really,’ said the voice in the dark. ‘You’re pretty good. You come
over as a frightened young lad trying to look big and brave. You might
pick your nose a bit more often. Just a tip. Few things interest a young
man more than the contents of his nostrils. Now I’ve got a favour to ask
you in return.’

I didn’t _ask_ you for one, Polly thought, quite annoyed at being taken
for being a frightened young lad when she was sure she’d come over as
quite a cool, non-ruffled young lad. But she said calmly: ‘What is it?’

‘Got any paper?’

Wordlessly, Polly pulled ‘From the Mothers of Borogravia!’ out of her
shirt and handed it up. She heard the sound of a match striking, and a
sulphurous smell which only improved the general conditions.

‘Why, is this the escutcheon of her grace the Duchess I see in front of
me?’ said the whisperer. ‘Well, it won’t be in front of me for long.
Beat it . . . boy.’

Polly hurried out into the night, shocked, dazed, confused and almost
asphyxiated, and made it to the shed door. But she’d barely shut it
behind her and was still blinking in the blackness when it was thrust
open again, to let in the wind, rain and Corporal Strappi.

‘All right, all right! Hands off . . . well, you lot wouldn’t be able to
find ’em . . . and on with socks! Hup hup hi ho hup hup . . .’

Bodies were suddenly springing up or falling over all round Polly. Their
muscles must have been obeying the voice directly, because no brain
could have got into gear that quickly. Corporal Strappi, in obedience to
the law of non-commissioned officers, responded by making the confusion
more confusing.

‘Good grief, a lot of old women could shift better’n you!’ he shouted
with satisfaction as people flailed around looking for coats and boots.
‘Fall in! Get shaved! Every man in the regiment to be clean shaven, by
order! Get dressed! Wazzer, I’ve got my eye on you! Move! Move!
Breakfast in five minutes! Last one there doesn’t get a sausage! Oh
deary me, what a bloody _shower_!’

The four lesser horsemen of Panic, Bewilderment, Ignorance and Shouting
took control of the room, to Corporal Strappi’s obscene glee. Polly,
though, ducked out of the door, pulled a small tin mug out of her pack,
dipped it into a water butt, balanced it on an old barrel behind the
inn, and started to shave.

She’d practised this, too. The secret was in the old cut-throat razor
that she’d carefully blunted. After that, it was all in the shaving
brush and soap. Get a lot of lather on, shave a lot of lather off, and
you’d had a shave, hadn’t you? Must have done, sir, feel how smooth the
skin is . . .

She was halfway through when a voice by her ear screamed: ‘What d’you
think you’re doing, Private Parts?’

It was just as well the blade _was_ blunt.

‘Perks, sir!’ she said, rubbing her nose. ‘I’m shaving, sir! It’s Perks,
sir!’

‘Sir? _Sir?_ I’m not a sir, Parts, I’m a bloody _corporal_, Parts. That
means you calls me “corporal”, Parts. And you are shaving in an official
regimental mug, Parts, what you have not been issued with, right? You a
deserter, Parts?’

‘No, s— corporal!’

‘A thief, then?’

‘No, corporal!’

‘Then how come you got a bloody mug, Parts?’

‘Got it off a dead man, sir— corporal!’

Strappi’s voice, pitched to a scream in any case, became a screech of
rage. ‘You’re a _looter_?’

‘No, corporal! The soldier . . .’

. . . had died almost in her arms, on the floor of the inn.

There had been half a dozen men in that party of returning heroes. They
must have been trekking with grey-faced patience for days, making their
way back to little villages in the mountains. Polly counted nine arms
and ten legs between them, and ten eyes.

But it was the apparently whole who were worse, in a way. They kept
their stinking coats buttoned tight, in lieu of bandages, over whatever
unspeakable mess lay beneath, and they had the smell of death about
them. The inn’s regulars made space for them, and talked quietly, like
people in a sacred place. Her father, not usually a man given to
sentiment, quietly put a generous tot of brandy into each mug of ale,
and refused all payment. Then it turned out that they were carrying
letters from soldiers still fighting, and one of them had brought the
letter from Paul. He pushed it across the table to Polly as she served
them stew and then, with very little fuss, he died.

The rest of the men moved unsteadily on later that day, taking with
them, to give to his parents, the pot-metal medal that had been in the
soldier’s coat pocket and the official commendation from the Duchy that
went with it. Polly had taken a look at it. It was printed, including
the Duchess’s signature, and the man’s name had been filled in, rather
cramped, because it was longer than average. The last few letters were
rammed up tight together.

It’s little details like that which get remembered, as undirected
white-hot rage fills the mind. Apart from the letter and the medal, all
the man left behind was a tin mug and, on the floor, a stain which
wouldn’t scrub out.

Corporal Strappi listened impatiently to a slightly adjusted version.
Polly could see his mind working. The mug had belonged to a soldier; now
it belonged to another soldier. Those were the facts of the matter, and
there wasn’t much he could do about it. He resorted, instead, to the
safer ground of general abuse.

‘So you think you’re smart, Parts?’ he said.

‘No, corporal.’

‘Oh? So you’re stupid, are you?’

‘Well, I did enlist, corporal,’ said Polly meekly. Somewhere behind
Strappi, someone sniggered.

‘I’ve got my eye on you, Parts,’ growled Strappi, temporarily defeated.
‘Just you put a foot wrong, that’s all.’ He strode off.

‘Um . . .’ said a voice beside Polly. She turned to see another youth,
wearing secondhand clothes and an air of nervousness that didn’t quite
conceal some bubbling anger. He was big and red-haired, but it was cut
so close that it was just head fuzz.

‘You’re Tonker, right?’ she said.

‘Yeah, and, er . . . could I have a borrow of your shaving gear, right?’

Polly looked at a chin as free of hair as a billiard ball. The boy
blushed.

‘Got to start sometime, right?’ he said defiantly.

‘The razor’ll need sharpening,’ said Polly.

‘That’s all right, I know how to do that,’ said Tonker.

Polly wordlessly handed over the mug and razor, and took the opportunity
to duck into the privy while everyone else was occupied. It was the work
of a moment to put the socks in place. Anchoring them was a problem,
which she solved by unwinding part of one sock and tucking it up under
her belt. They felt odd, and strangely heavy for a little package of
wool. Walking a little awkwardly, Polly went in to see what horrors
breakfast would bring.

It brought stale horse-bread and sausage and very weak beer. She grabbed
a sausage and a slab of bread and sat down.

You had to concentrate to eat horse-bread. There was a lot more about
these days, a bread made from flour ground up with dried pease and beans
and vegetable scrapings. It used to be made just for horses, to put them
in fine condition. Now you hardly ever saw anything else on the table,
and there tended to be less and less of it, too. You needed time and
good teeth to work your way through a slice of horse-bread, just as you
needed a complete lack of imagination to eat a modern sausage. Polly sat
and concentrated on chewing.

The only other area of calm was around Private Maladict, who was
drinking coffee like a young man relaxing in a pavement café, with the
air of someone who has life thoroughly worked out. He nodded at Polly.

Was that him in the privy? she wondered. I got back in just as Strappi
started yelling and everyone started running around and rushing in and
out. It could have been _anyone_. Do vampires use the privy? Well, do
they? Has anyone ever dared ask?

‘Sleep well?’ he asked.

‘Yeah. Did you?’ said Polly.

‘I couldn’t stand that shed, but Mr Eyebrow _kindly_ allowed me to use
his cellar,’ said Maladict. ‘Old habits die hard, you know? At least,’
he added, ‘old _acceptable_ habits. I’ve never felt happy not hanging
down.’

‘And you got _coffee?_’

‘I carry my own supply,’ said Maladict, indicating an exquisite little
silver and gilt coffee-making engine on the table by his cup, ‘and Mr
Eyebrow kindly boiled some water for me.’ He grinned, showing two long
canine teeth. ‘It’s amazing what you can achieve with a smile, Oliver.’

Polly nodded. ‘Er . . . is Igor a friend of yours?’ she said. At the
next table Igor had obtained a sausage, presumably raw, from the
kitchen, and was watching it intently. A couple of wires ran from the
sausage to a mug of the horrible vinegary beer, which was bubbling.

‘Never seen him before in my life,’ said the vampire. ‘Of course, if
you’ve met one you have in a sense met them all. We had an Igor at home.
Wonderful workers. Very reliable. Very trustworthy. And, of course, so
good at stitching things together, if you know what I mean.’

‘Those stitches round his head don’t look very professional,’ said
Polly, who was beginning to object to Maladict’s permanent expression of
effortless superiority.

‘Oh, that? It’s an Igor thing,’ said Maladict. ‘It’s a Look. Like . . .
tribal markings, you know? They like them to show. Ha, we had a servant
once who had stitches all the way round his neck, and he was _extremely_
proud of them.’

‘Really?’ said Polly weakly.

‘Yes, and the droll part of it all was that it wasn’t even _his_ head!’

Now Igor had a syringe in his hand, and was watching the sausage with an
air of satisfaction. For a moment, Polly thought that the sausage moved
. . .

‘All right, all right, time’s up, you horrible lot!’ barked Corporal
Strappi, strutting into the room. ‘Fall in! That means line up, you
shower! That means you too, Parts! And you, Mr Vampire, sir, will you be
joining us for a morning’s light soldiering? On your feet! And where’s
that bloody Igor?’

‘Here, thur,’ said Igor, from three inches behind Strappi’s backbone.
The corporal spun round.

‘How did you get there?’ he bellowed.

‘It’th a gift, thur,’ said Igor.

‘Don’t you _ever_ get behind me again! Fall in with the rest of them!
Now . . . Attention!’ Strappi sighed theatrically. ‘That means “stand up
straight”. Got it? Once more with feeling! Attention! Ah, I see the
problem! You’ve got trousers that are permanently at ease! I think I
shall have to write to the Duchess and tell her she should ask for her
money back! What are you smiling about, Mr Vampire sir?’ Strappi
positioned himself in front of Maladict, who stood faultlessly to
attention.

‘Happy to be in the regiment, corporal!’

‘Yeah, right,’ mumbled Strappi. ‘Well, you won’t be so—’

‘_Everything all right, corporal?_’ asked Sergeant Jackrum, appearing in
the doorway.

‘Best we could expect, sergeant,’ sighed the corporal. ‘We ought to
throw ’em back, oh dear me, yes. Useless, useless, useless . . .’

‘Okay, lads. Stand easy,’ said Jackrum, glancing at Strappi in a less
than friendly way. ‘Today we’re heading on down towards Plotz, where
we’ll meet up with the other recruiting parties and you’ll be issued
with your uniforms and weapons, you lucky lads. Any of you ever used a
weapon? You _have_, Perks?’

Polly lowered her hand. ‘A bit, sarge. My brother taught me a bit when
he was home on leave, and some of the old men in the bar where I worked
gave me some, er, tips.’ They had, too. It was funny to watch a girl
waving a sword around, and they’d been kind enough when they weren’t
laughing. She was a quick learner, but she’d made a point of staying
clumsy long after she’d got the feel for the blade, because using a
sword was also ‘the work of an Man’ and a woman doing it was an
Abomination unto Nuggan. Old soldiers, on the whole, were on the
easy-going side when it came to Abominations. She’d be funny just as
long as she was useless, and safe as long as she was funny.

‘Expert, are yer?’ said Strappi, grinning nastily. ‘A real fencin’
genius, are yer?’

‘No, corporal,’ said Polly meekly.

‘All right,’ said Jackrum. ‘Anyone else—’

‘Hang on, sarge, I reckon we’d _all_ like a bit of instruction from
swordmeister Parts,’ said Strappi. ‘Ain’t that right, lads?’ There was a
general murmuring and shrugging from the squad, who recognized a right
little bullying bastard when they saw one but, treacherously, were glad
he hadn’t picked on them.

Strappi drew his own sword. ‘Lend him one of yours, sarge,’ he said. ‘Go
on. Just a little bit of fun, eh?’

Jackrum hesitated, and glanced at Polly. ‘How about it, lad? You don’t
have to,’ he said.

I’ll have to sooner or later, Polly thought. The world was full of
Strappies. If you backed away from them, they only kept on coming. You
had to stop them at the start. She sighed. ‘Okay, sarge.’

Jackrum pulled one of his cutlasses out of his sash and handed it to
Polly. It looked amazingly sharp.

‘He won’t hurt you, Perks,’ he said, while looking at the smirking
Strappi.

‘I’ll try not to hurt him either, sir,’ said Polly, and then cursed
herself for the idiot bravado. It must have been the socks talking.

‘Oh, _good_,’ said Strappi, stepping back. ‘We’ll just see what you’re
made of, Parts.’

Flesh, thought Polly. Blood. Easily cut things. Oh, well . . .

Strappi waved his sabre like the old boys had done, down low, in case
she was one of those people who thought the whole idea was to hit the
other man’s sword. She ignored it, and watched his eyes, which was no
great treat. He wouldn’t stick her, not mortally, not with Jackrum
watching. He’d try for something that’d hurt and make everyone laugh at
her. That was the Strappi type through and through. Every inn counted
one or two amongst its regulars.

The corporal tested her more aggressively a couple of times, and twice,
by luck, she managed to knock the blade out of the way. Luck would run
out, though, and if she looked like putting up a decent show Strappi
_would_ sort her out good and proper. Then she remembered the cackled
advice of old Gummy Abbens, a retired sergeant who’d lost his left arm
to a broadsword and all his teeth to cider: ‘A good swordsman ’ates
comin’ up against a newbie, gel! The reason bein’, he don’t know what
the bugger’s gonna do!’

She swung the cutlass wildly. Strappi had to block it, and for a moment
the swords locked.

‘That the best you can do, Parts?’ the corporal jeered.

Polly reached out and grabbed his shirt. ‘No, corporal,’ she said, ‘but
_this_ is.’ She pulled hard and lowered her head.

The collision hurt more than she’d hoped, but she heard something crunch
and it didn’t belong to her. She stepped back quickly, slightly dizzy,
with the cutlass at the ready.

Strappi had sunk to his knees, blood gushing from his nose. When he got
up, _someone_ was going to die . . .

Panting, Polly appealed wordlessly to Sergeant Jackrum, who had folded
his arms and was looking innocently at the ceiling.

‘I bet you didn’t learn _that_ from your brother, Perks,’ he said.

‘No, sarge. Got that from Gummy Abbens, sarge.’

Jackrum suddenly looked down at her, grinning. ‘What, old Sergeant
Abbens?’

‘Yes, sarge!’

‘There’s a name from the past! He’s still alive? How is the evil old
sot?’

‘Er . . . well preserved, sarge,’ said Polly, still trying to get her
breath.

Jackrum laughed. ‘Yeah, I’ll bet. Did his best fighting in bars, he did.
And I’ll bet that’s not the only trick he told you about, eh?’

‘No, sir.’ And the other men had scolded the old boy for telling her,
and Gummy had chuckled into his cider mug, and anyway it had taken Polly
a long time to find out what ‘family jewels’ meant.

‘Hear that, Strappi?’ said the sergeant to the cursing man dribbling
blood on to the floor. ‘Looks like you was lucky. But there’s no prizes
for fighting fair in a mêlée, lads, as you will learn. All right, fun
over. Go and put some cold water on that, corporal. It always looks
worse than it is. And _that’s an end of it_, the pair of you. That is an
_order_. A word to the wise. Understood?’

‘Yes, sarge,’ said Polly meekly. Strappi grunted.

Jackrum looked at the rest of the recruits. ‘Okay. Any of the rest of
you boys ever held a stick? Right. I can see we’re going to have to
start slow and work up . . .’

There was another grunt from Strappi. You had to admire the man. On his
knees, with blood bubbling through the hand cupping his injured nose, he
could find time to make life difficult for someone in some small way.

‘Private Bloodfnucker hnas a fnord, fnargeant,’ he said accusingly.

‘Any good with it?’ said the sergeant to Maladict.

‘Not really, sir,’ said Maladict. ‘Never had training. I carry it for
protection, sir.’

‘How can you protect yourself by carrying a sword if you don’t know how
to use it?’

‘Not me, sir. Other people. They see the sword and don’t attack me,’
said Maladict patiently.

‘Yes, but if they did, lad, you wouldn’t be any good with it,’ said the
sergeant.

‘No, sir. I’d probably settle for just ripping their heads off, sir.
That’s what I mean by protection, sir. Theirs, not mine. And I’d get
hell from the League if I did that, sir.’

The sergeant stared at him for a while. ‘Well thought out,’ he mumbled.

There was a thud behind them and a table overturned. Carborundum the
troll sat up, groaned, and crashed back down again. At the second
attempt, he managed to stay upright, both hands clutching his head.

Corporal Strappi, now on his feet, must have been made fearless by fury.
He headed for the troll in a high-speed strut and stood in front of him,
vibrating with rage and still oozing blood in sticky strings.

‘You ’orrible little man!’ he screamed. ‘You—’

Carborundum reached down and, with care and no apparent effort, picked
the corporal up by his head. He brought him to one crusted eye and
turned him this way and that.

‘Did I join th’ army?’ he rumbled. ‘Oh, coprolite . . .’

‘This is affnault on a fnuperior officer!’ screamed the muffled voice of
the corporal.

‘Put Corporal Strappi down, please,’ said Sergeant Jackrum. The troll
grunted, and lowered the man to the floor.

‘Sorry about dat,’ he said. ‘Thought you was a dwarf.’

‘I dnemand this man is affrested for—’ Strappi began.

‘No you don’t, corporal, no you don’t,’ said the sergeant. ‘This is not
the time. On your feet, Carborundum, and get in line. Upon my oath, you
try that little trick one more time and there will be trouble,
understand?’

‘Yes, sergeant,’ growled the troll, and knuckled himself to his feet.

‘Right, then,’ said the sergeant, stepping back. ‘Now today, my lucky
lads, we’re goin’ to learn about something we call marching . . .’

They left Plün to the wind and rain. About an hour after they’d vanished
round a bend in the valley, the shed they’d slept in mysteriously burned
down.

There have been better attempts at marching, and they have been made by
penguins. Sergeant Jackrum brought up the rear in the cart, shouting
instructions, but the recruits moved as if they’d never before had to
get from place to place. The sergeant yelled the swagger out of their
steps, stopped the cart and for a few of them held an impromptu lesson
in the concepts of ‘right’ and ‘left’ and, by degrees, they left the
mountains.

Polly remembered those first days with mixed feelings. All they did was
march, but she was used to long walks and her boots were good. The
trousers ceased to chafe. A watery sun took the trouble to shine. It
wasn’t cold. It would have been fine, if it hadn’t been for the
corporal.

She’d wondered how Strappi, whose nose was now about the same colour as
a plum, was going to handle the situation between them. It turned out
that he intended to deal with it by pretending it hadn’t happened, and
also by having as little as possible to do with Polly.

He didn’t spare the others, although he was selective. Maladict was left
strictly alone, as was Carborundum; whatever else Strappi was, he wasn’t
suicidal. And he was bewildered by Igor. The little man did whatever
stupid chore Strappi found for him, and he did it quickly, competently,
and giving every impression of someone happy in his work, and that left
the corporal completely mystified.

He’d pick on the others for no reason at all, harangue them until they
made some trivial mistake, and then bawl them out. His target of choice
was Private Goom, better known as Wazzer, who was stick-thin and
round-eyed and nervous and said grace loudly before meals. By the end of
the first day, Strappi could make him throw up just by shouting. And
then he’d laugh.

Only he never really _laughed_, Polly noted. What you got instead was a
sort of harsh gargling of spit at the back of the throat, a noise like
_ghnssssh_.

The presence of the man cast a damper on everything. Jackrum seldom
interfered. He often watched Strappi, though, and once when Polly caught
his eye, he winked.

On the first night a tent was shouted off the cart by Strappi and
shouted up and, after a supper of stale bread and sausage, they were
shouted in front of a blackboard to be shouted at. Across the top of the
board Strappi had written WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR and down the side he
had written 1, 2, 3.

‘Right, pay attention!’ he said, slapping the board with a stick.
‘There’s some who think that you boys ought to know _why_ we are
fighting this war, okay? Well, here it comes. Point One, remember the
town of Lipz? It was viciously attacked by Zlobenian troops a year ago!
They—’

‘Sorry, but I thought _we_ attacked Lipz, didn’t we, corporal? Last year
they said—’ said Shufti.

‘Are you trying to be smart, Private Manickle?’ Strappi demanded, naming
the biggest sin in his personal list.

‘Just want to know, corporal,’ said Shufti. He was stocky, running to
plump, and one of those people who bustle about being helpful in a
mildly annoying way, taking over small jobs that you wouldn’t have
minded doing for yourself. There was something odd about him, although
you had to bear in mind he was currently sitting next to Wazzer, who had
enough odd for everybody and was probably contagious . . .

. . . and had caught Strappi’s eye. There was no fun in having a go at
Shufti, but Wazzer, now, Wazzer was always worth a shout.

‘Are you _listening_, Private Goom?’ he screamed.

Wazzer, who had been sitting and looking up with his eyes closed, jerked
awake. ‘Corporal?’ he quavered, as Strappi advanced.

‘I _said_, are you listening, Goom?’

‘Yes, corporal!’

‘_Really?_ And what did you hear, may I ask?’ said Strappi, in a voice
of treacle and acid.

‘Nothing, corporal. She’s not speaking.’

Strappi took a deep, delighted breath of evil air. ‘You are a useless,
worthless pile of—’

There was a sound. It was a small, nondescript sound, one that you heard
every day, a noise that did its job but never expected to be, for
example, whistled or part of an interesting sonata. It was simply the
sound of stone scraping on metal.

On the other side of the fire Jackrum lowered his cutlass. He had a
sharpening stone in his other hand. He returned their group gaze.

‘What? Oh. Just maintaining the edge,’ he said innocently. ‘Sorry if I
interrupted your flow there, corporal. Carry on.’

A basic animal survival instinct came to the corporal’s aid. He left the
trembling Wazzer alone, and turned back to Shufti.

‘Yes, yes, we attacked Lipz, too—’ said Strappi.

‘Was that before the Zlobenians did?’ said Maladict.

‘Will you listen?’ Strappi demanded. ‘We valiantly attacked Lipz to
reclaim what is Borogravian territory! And _then_ the treacherous
swede-eaters stole it back . . .’

Polly tuned out a little at this point, now that there was no immediate
prospect of seeing Strappi decapitated. She knew about Lipz. Half the
old men who came and drank with her father had attacked the place. But
no one had expected them to _want_ to do it. Someone had just shouted,
‘Attack!’

The trouble was the Kneck River. It wandered across the wide, rich,
silty plain like a piece of dropped string, but sometimes a flash flood
or even a big fallen tree would cause it to crack like a whip, throwing
coils of river round areas of land miles from its previous bed. And the
river was the international border . . .

She surfaced to hear: ‘. . . but this time _everyone’s_ on their side,
the bastards! And you know why? It’s ’cos of Ankh-Morpork! Because we
stopped the mail coaches going over our country and tore down their
clacks towers, which are an Abomination unto Nuggan. Ankh-Morpork is a
godless city—’

‘I thought it had more than three hundred places of worship?’ said
Maladict.

Strappi stared at him in a rage that was incoherent until he managed to
touch bottom again. ‘Ankh-Morpork is a _godawful_ city,’ he recovered.
‘Poisonous, just like its river. Barely fit for humans now. They let
everything in – zombies, werewolves, dwarfs, vampires, trolls . . .’ He
remembered his audience, faltered and recovered. ‘. . . which _in some
cases_ can be a good thing, of course. But it is a foul, lewd, lawless,
overcrowded mess of a place, which is why Prince Heinrich loves it so
much! He’s been taken over by it, bought by cheap toys, because that’s
the way Ankh-Morpork plays it, men. They _buy_ you, they _will you stop
interrupting!_ What’s the good of me trying to teach you stuff if you’re
going to keep on asking questions?’

‘I was just wondering why it’s so crowded, corp,’ said Tonker. ‘If it’s
so bad, I mean.’

‘That’s because they are a degraded people, private! And they’ve sent a
regiment up here to help Heinrich take over our beloved Motherland. He
has turned aside from the ways of Nuggan and embraced Ankh-Morpork’s
godlessn— godawfulness.’ Strappi looked pleased at having spotted that
one, and went on, ‘Point Two: in addition to its soldiers, Ankh-Morpork
has sent Vimes the Butcher, the most evil man in that evil city. They
are bent on nothing less than our destruction!’

‘I heard that Ankh-Morpork was just angry that we cut the clacks towers
down,’ said Polly.

‘They were on our sovereign territory!’

‘Well, it was Zlobenian until—’ Polly began.

Strappi waved an angry finger at her. ‘You listen to me, Parts! You
can’t get to be a great country like Borogravia without making enemies!
Which leads me on to Point Three, Parts, who’s sitting there thinking
he’s so smart. You all are. I can see it. Well, be smart about this: you
might not like everything about your country, eh? It might not be the
perfect place, but it’s ours. You might think we don’t have the best
laws, but they’re ours. The mountains might not be the prettiest ones or
the tallest ones, but they’re ours. We’re fighting for what’s ours,
men!’ Strappi slammed his hand over his heart.

‘Awake, ye sons of the Motherland!

Taste no more the wine of the sour apples . . .’

They joined in, at various levels of drone. You had to. Even if you just
opened and shut your mouth, you had to. Even if you just went ‘ner, ner,
ner’, you had to. Polly, who was exactly the kind of person who looks
around surreptitiously at times like these, saw that Shufti was singing
it word-perfectly and Strappi actually did have tears in his eyes.
Wazzer wasn’t singing at all. He was praying. That was a good wheeze,
said one of the more treacherous areas at the back of Polly’s mind.

To the bewilderment of all, Strappi continued – alone – all through the
second verse, which nobody ever remembered, and then gave them a smug,
I’m-more-patriotic-than-you smile.

Afterwards, they tried to sleep on as much softness as two blankets
could provide. They lay there in silence for some time. Jackrum and
Strappi had tents of their own, but instinctively they knew that Strappi
at least would be a sneaker and a listener at tent flaps.

After about an hour, when rain was drumming on the canvas, Carborundum
said: ‘Okay, den, I fink I’ve worked it out. If people are groophar
stupid, then we’ll fight for groophar stupidity, ’cos it’s _our_
stupidity. And dat’s good, yeah?’

Several of the squad sat up in the darkness, amazed at this.

‘I realize I ought to know these things, but what does “groophar” mean?’
said the voice of Maladict in the damp darkness.

‘Ah, well . . . when, right, a daddy troll an’ a mummy troll—’

‘Good, right, yes, I think I’ve got it, thank you,’ said Maladict. ‘And
what _you’ve_ got there, my friend, is patriotism. My country, right or
wrong.’

‘You _should_ love your country,’ said Shufti.

‘Okay, what part?’ the voice of Tonker demanded, from the far corner of
the tent. ‘The morning sunlight on the mountains? The horrible food? The
damn mad Abominations? All of my country except whatever bit Strappi is
standing on?’

‘But we are at war!’

‘Yes, that’s where they’ve got you,’ sighed Polly.

‘Well, I’m not buying into it. It’s all trickery. They keep you down and
when they piss off some other country, _you_ have to fight for them!
It’s only _your_ country when they want you to get killed!’ said Tonker.

‘All the good bits in this country are in this tent,’ said the voice of
Wazzer.

Embarrassed silence descended.

The rain settled in. After a while, the tent began to leak. Eventually
someone said, ‘What happens, um, if you join up but then you decide you
don’t want to?’

That was Shufti.

‘I think it’s called deserting and they cut your head off,’ said the
voice of Maladict. ‘In my case that would be a drawback but you, dear
Shufti, would find it puts a crimp in your social life.’

‘I never kissed their damn picture,’ said Tonker. ‘I swivelled it round
when Strappi wasn’t looking and kissed it on the back!’

‘They’ll still say you kissed the Duchess, though,’ said Maladict.

‘You k-kissed the D-Duchess on the b-bottom?’ said Wazzer, horrified.

‘It was the back of the picture, okay?’ said Tonker. ‘It wasn’t her real
backside. Huh, wouldn’t have kissed it if it was!’ There was some
unidentified sniggering from various corners and just a hint of giggle.

‘That was w-wicked!’ hissed Wazzer. ‘Nuggan in heaven saw you d-do
that!’

‘It was just a picture, all right?’ muttered Tonker. ‘Anyway, what’s the
difference? Front or back, we’re all here together and I don’t see any
steak and bacon!’

Something rumbled overhead. ‘I joined t’ see exciting forrin places and
meet erotic people,’ said Carborundum.

That caused a moment’s thought. ‘I think you mean exotic?’ said Igor.

‘Yeah, that kind of stuff,’ agreed the troll.

‘But they always lie,’ said someone, and then Polly realized it was her.
‘They lie all the time. About everything.’

‘Amen to that,’ said Tonker. ‘We fight for liars.’

‘Ah, they may be liars,’ snapped Polly, in a passable imitation of
Strappi’s yap, ‘but they’re _our_ liars!’

‘Now, now, children,’ said Maladict. ‘Let’s try to get some sleep, shall
we? But here’s a happy little dream from your Uncle Maladict. Dream that
when we go into battle, Corporal Strappi is _leading_ us. Wouldn’t that
be fun?’

After a while, Tonker said: ‘In front of us, you mean?’

‘Oh, yes. I can see you’re with me, Tonk. Right in front of you. On the
noisy, frantic, _confusing_ battlefield, where oh so much can go wrong.’

‘And we’ll have weapons?’ said Shufti wistfully.

‘Of course you’ll have weapons. You’re soldiers. And there’s the enemy,
right in front of you . . .’

‘That’s a good dream, Mal.’

‘Sleep on it, kid.’

Polly turned over, and tried to make herself comfortable. It’s all lies,
she thought muzzily. Some of them are just prettier than others, that’s
all. People see what they think is there. Even I’m a lie. But I’m
getting away with it.

A warm autumnal wind was blowing leaves off the rowan trees as the
recruits marched among the foothills. It was the morning of the next
day, and the mountains were behind them. Polly passed the time
identifying the birds in the hedgerows. It was a habit. She knew most of
them.

_She hadn’t set out to be an ornithologist. But birds brought Paul
alive. All the . . . slowness in the rest of his thinking became a flash
of lightning in the presence of birds. Suddenly he knew their names,
habits and_ _habitats, could whistle their songs and, after Polly had
saved up for a box of paints off a traveller at the inn, had painted a
picture of a wren so real you could_ hear _it._

_Their mother had been alive then. The row had gone on for days.
Pictures of living creatures were an Abomination in the Eyes of Nuggan.
Polly had asked why there were pictures of the Duchess everywhere, and
had been thrashed for it. The picture had been burned, the paints thrown
away._

_It was a terrible thing. Her mother had been a kind woman, or as kind
as a devout woman could be who tried to keep up with the whims of
Nuggan, and she’d died slowly amidst pictures of the Duchess and amongst
the echoes of unanswered prayers, but that was the memory that crawled
treacherously into Polly’s mind every time: the fury and the scolding,
while the little bird seemed to flutter in the flames._

In the fields women and old men were getting in the spoilt wheat after
last night’s rain, hoping to save what they could. There weren’t any
young men visible. Polly saw some of the other recruits steal a glance
at the scavenging parties, and wondered if they were thinking the same
thing.

They saw no one else on the road until midday, when the party was
marching through a landscape of low hills; the sun had boiled away some
of the clouds and, for a moment at least, summer was back – moist and
sticky and mildly unpleasant, like a party guest who won’t go home.

A red blob in the distance became a rather larger blob and resolved
itself into a loose knot of men. Polly knew what to expect as soon as
she saw it. By the reaction of some of the others, they did not. There
was a moment of collision and confusion as people walked into one
another, and then the party stopped, and stared.

It took the wounded men some time to draw level, and some time to pass.
Two able-bodied men, as far as Polly could tell, were trundling a
handcart on which a third man lay. Others were limping on crutches, or
had arms in slings, or wore red jackets with an empty sleeve. Perhaps
worse were the ones like the man in the inn, grey-faced, staring
straight ahead, jackets buttoned tight despite the heat.

One or two of the injured glanced at the recruits as they lurched past,
but there was no expression in their eyes beyond a terrible
determination.

Jackrum reined in the horse.

‘All right, twenty minutes’ breather,’ he muttered.

Igor turned, nodded to the party of wounded heading grimly onward, and
said, ‘Permithion to thee if I can do anything for them, tharge?’

‘You’ll get your chance soon enough, lad,’ said the sergeant.

‘Tharge?’ said Igor, looking hurt.

‘Oh, all right. If you must. D’you want someone to give you a hand?’

There was a nasty laugh from Corporal Strappi.

‘Some athithtance would be a help, yeth, thargeant,’ said Igor, with
dignity.

The sergeant looked at the squad, and nodded. ‘Private Halter, step
forward! Know anything about doctorin’?’

The red-headed Tonker stepped forward smartly. ‘I’ve butchered pigs for
me mam, sarge,’ he said.

‘Capital! Better than an army surgeon, upon my oath. Off you go. Twenty
minutes, remember!’

‘And don’t let Igor bring back any souvenirs!’ said Strappi, and laughed
his scraping laugh again.

The rest of the boys sat down on the grass by the road, and one or two
of them disappeared into the bushes. Polly went on the same errand, but
pushed in a lot further, and took the opportunity to make a little sock
adjustment. They had a tendency to creep if she wasn’t careful.

She froze at a rustling behind her, and then relaxed. She’d been
careful. No one would have seen anything. So what if someone else was
taking a leak? She’d just push her way back to the road and take no
notice—

Lofty sprang up as Polly parted the bushes, breeches round one ankle,
face red as a beetroot.

Polly couldn’t help herself. Maybe it was the socks. Maybe it was the
pleading expression on Lofty’s face. When someone’s broadcasting ‘Don’t
look!’ the eyes have a mind of their own, and go where they’re not
wanted. Lofty jumped up, dragging at her clothes.

‘No, look, it’s all right—’ Polly began, but it was too late. The girl
had gone.

Polly stared at the bushes, and thought: Blast! There’s _two_ of us! But
what would I have said next? ‘It’s okay, I’m a girl too. You can trust
me. We could be friends. Oh, and here’s a good tip about socks’?

Igor and Tonker arrived back late, without a word. Sergeant Jackrum said
nothing. The squad moved off.

Polly marched at the back, with Carborundum. This meant she could keep a
wary eye on Lofty, whoever she was. For the first time, Polly really
looked at her. She was easy to miss, because she was always, as it were,
in Tonker’s shadow. She was short, although now Polly knew she was
female the word ‘petite’ could be decently used, dark and dark-haired
and had a strange, self-absorbed look, and she was always marching with
Tonker. Come to think of it, she always slept close to him, too.

Ah, so that was it. She’s following her boy, Polly thought. It was kind
of romantic, and very, very dumb. Now she knew to look beyond the
clothes and haircut, she could see all the little clues that Lofty was a
girl, and a girl who hadn’t planned enough. She saw Lofty whisper
something to Tonker, who half turned and gave Polly a look of instant
hatred and a hint of threat.

I _can’t_ tell her, she thought. She _would_ tell him. I can’t _afford_
to let them know. I’ve put too much into this. I didn’t just cut my hair
and wear trousers. I _planned_ . . .

Ah, yes . . . the plans.

It had _begun_ as a sudden strange fancy, but it had continued as a
plan. First, Polly had started to watch boys closely. This had been
reciprocated hopefully by a few of them, to their subsequent
disappointment. She observed how they moved, she listened to the rhythm
of what passed, among boys, for conversation, she’d noted how they
punched one another in greeting. It was a new world.

She already had good muscles for a girl, because running a large inn was
all about moving heavy things, and she took over a number of the
grittier chores, which coarsened her hands nicely. She’d even worn a
pair of her brother’s old breeches under her long skirt, to get the feel
of them.

A woman could be beaten for that sort of thing. Men dressed like men and
women like women; doing it the other way round was ‘a blasphemous
Abomination unto Nuggan’, according to Father Jupe.

And that was probably the secret of her success so far, she thought, as
she trudged through a puddle. People didn’t _look_ for a woman in
trousers. To the casual observer, men’s clothes and short hair and a bit
of swagger were what it took to be a man. Oh, and a second pair of
socks.

That had been gnawing at her, too. Someone knew about her, just as she
knew about Lofty. _And he hadn’t given her away._ She’d suspected it was
Eyebrow, but doubted it; he’d have told the sergeant about her, he was
that sort. Right now she was guessing it was Maladict, but perhaps that
was just because he seemed so _knowing_ all the time.

Carbor— no, he’d been out cold, and in any case . . . no, not the troll.
And Igor lisped. Tonker? After all, he’d know about Lofty so maybe . . .
No, because why would he want to help Polly? No, there was nothing but
danger in owning up to Lofty. The best she could do was try to see to it
that the girl didn’t give both of them away.

She could hear Tonker whispering to his girl. ‘. . . had just died so he
cut off one of his legs and an arm and sewed ’em on men who needed ’em,
just like I’d darn a tear! You should’ve seen it! You couldn’t see his
fingers move! And he has all these ointments that just . . .’ Tonker’s
voice died away. Strappi was haranguing Wazzer again.

‘Dat Strappi really gets on my crags,’ muttered Carborundum. ‘You want I
should pull the head off ’f him? I c’d make it look like a accident.’

‘Better not,’ said Polly, but she did entertain the thought for a
moment.

They’d reached a junction, where the road down from the mountains joined
what passed for a main highway. It was crowded. There were carts and
wheelbarrows, people driving herds of cows, grandmothers carrying all
the household possessions on their backs, a general excitement of pigs
and children . . . and it was all heading one way.

It was the opposite way to the way the squad was going. The people and
animals flowed around it like a stream around an inconvenient rock. The
recruits bunched up. It was that or be separated by cows.

Sergeant Jackrum stood up in the cart. ‘Private Carborundum!’

‘Yes, sergeant?’ rumbled the troll.

‘To the front!’

That helped. The stream still flowed, but at least the crowds parted
some distance further ahead and gave the squad a wide berth. No one
wants to barge up against even a slow-moving troll.

But faces stared as the people hurried by. An old lady darted out for a
moment, pressed a loaf of stale bread into Tonker’s hands, and said,
‘You poor boys!’ before being swept away in the throng.

‘What’s this all about, sarge?’ said Maladict. ‘These look like
refugees!’

‘Talk like that spreads Alarm and Despondency!’ shouted Corporal
Strappi.

‘Oh, you mean they’re just people getting away early for the holidays to
avoid the rush?’ said Maladict. ‘Sorry, I got confused. It must be that
woman carrying a whole haystack we just passed.’

‘D’you know what can happen to you for cheeking a superior officer?’
screamed Strappi.

‘No! Tell me, is it worse than whatever it is these people are running
away from?’

‘You signed up, Mr Bloodsucker! You obey orders!’

‘Right! But I don’t remember anyone ordering me not to think!’

‘Enough of that!’ snapped Jackrum. ‘Less shouting down there! Move on!
Carborundum, you give people a push if they don’t make way, y’hear?’

They moved on. After a while the press of people abated a little, so
that what had been a torrent became a trickle. Occasionally there would
be a family group, or just one hurrying woman, burdened with bags. One
old man was struggling with a wheelbarrow full of turnips. _They’re even
taking the crops out of the fields_, Polly noted. And everyone moved at
a kind of half-run, as if things would be a little better when they’d
caught up with the mass of people ahead. Or merely passed the squad,
perhaps.

They made way for an old woman bent double under the weight of a black
and white pig. And then there was just the road, rutted and muddy. An
afternoon mist was rising from the fields on either side, quiet and
clammy. After the noise of the refugees, the silence of the low
countryside was suddenly oppressive. The only sound was the trudge and
splash of the recruits’ boots.

‘Permission to speak, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Yes, private?’ said Jackrum.

‘How far is it to Plotz?’

‘You don’t have to tell ’em, sarge!’ said Strappi.

‘About five miles,’ said Sergeant Jackrum. ‘You’ll get your uniforms and
weapons at the depot there.’

‘That’s a milit’ry secret, sarge,’ Strappi whined.

‘We could shut our eyes so’s we don’t see what we’re wearing, how about
that?’ said Maladict.

‘Stop that, Private Maladict,’ said Jackrum. ‘Just keep moving, and
guard that tongue.’

They plodded on. The road grew muddier. A breeze sprang up, but instead
of carrying the mist away it merely streamed it across the damp fields
in twisty, clammy, unpleasant shapes. The sun became an orange ball.

Polly saw something large and white flutter across the field, blown by
the wind. At first she thought it was a migratory lesser egret that had
left things a little late, but it was clearly being blown by the wind.
It flopped down once or twice and then, as a gust caught it, blew across
the road and wrapped itself across Corporal Strappi’s face.

He screamed. Lofty grabbed at the fluttering thing, which was damp. It
tore in his— _her_ hands, and most of it dropped away from the
struggling corporal.

‘It’s just a bit of paper,’ she said.

Strappi flailed at it. ‘I _knew_ that,’ he said. ‘I never asked you!’

Polly picked up one of the torn scraps. The paper was thin, and stained
with mud, although she recognized the word Ankh-Morpork. The godawful
city. And the genius of Strappi was that anything he was against
automatically sounded attractive.

‘_Ankh-Morpork Times_ . . .’ she read aloud, before the corporal
snatched it out of her hand.

‘You can’t just read _anything_ you see, Parts!’ he shouted. ‘You don’t
know who wrote it!’ He dropped the damp scrap pages on to the mud and
stamped on them. ‘Now let’s move on!’ he said.

They moved on. When the squad were more or less in rhythm, and staring
at nothing more than their boots or the mist ahead of them, Polly raised
her right hand to chest height and carefully turned it palm up so that
she could see the fragment of paper that had soggily stayed behind when
the rest had been pulled away.

They _were_ winning, weren’t they? So where did the word ‘surrender’
come from? And what was the Alliance?

And then there was the problem of Strappi, which had been growing on
her. She could see he got on Jackrum’s nerves as well, and he had a
struttiness about him, a certain – er . . . sockiness, as if he was
really the one in charge. Perhaps it was just general unpleasantness,
but . . .

‘Corporal?’ she said.

‘Yes, Parts?’ said Strappi. His nose was still very red.

‘We are winning this war, aren’t we?’ said Polly. She’d given up
correcting him.

Suddenly, every ear in the squad was listening.

‘Don’t you bother yourself about that, Parts!’ snapped the corporal.
‘Your job is to fight!’

‘Right, corp. So . . . I’ll be fighting on the winning side, will I?’

‘Oho, we’ve got someone who asks too many questions here, sarge!’ said
Strappi.

‘Yeah, don’t ask questions, Perks,’ said Jackrum, absent-mindedly.

‘So we’re losing, then?’ said Tonker. Strappi turned on him.

‘That’s spreading Alarm and Despondency again, that is!’ he shrieked.
‘That’s aiding the enemy!’

‘Yeah, knock it off, Private Halter,’ said Jackrum. ‘Okay? Now get a—’

‘Halter, I’m placing you under arrest for—’

‘_Corporal Strappi, a word in your shell-like ear, please? You men, you
stop here!_’ growled the sergeant, clambering down from the cart.

Jackrum walked back down the road about fifty feet. Glaring round at the
squad, the corporal strutted after him.

‘Are we in trouble?’ said Tonker.

‘You guess,’ said Maladict.

‘Bound to be,’ said Shufti. ‘Strappi can always get you for
_something_.’

‘They’re having an argument,’ said Maladict. ‘Which is odd, don’t you
think? A sergeant is supposed to give _orders_ to a corporal.’

‘We _are_ winning, aren’t we?’ said Shufti. ‘I mean, I know there’s a
war, but . . . I mean, we get weapons, don’t we, and we’ll . . . well,
they’ve got to train us, right? It’ll probably be all over by then,
right? Everyone says we’re winning.’

‘I will ask the Duchess in my prayers tonight,’ said Wazzer.

The rest of the squad looked at one another with a shared expression.

‘Yeah, right, Wazz,’ said Tonker kindly. ‘You do that.’

The sun was setting fast, half hidden in the mist. Here, on the muddy
road between damp fields, it suddenly felt as cold as it could be.

‘No one says we’re winning, except maybe Strappi,’ said Polly. ‘They
just say that everyone says we’re winning.’

‘The men Igor . . . repaired didn’t even say that,’ said Tonker. ‘They
said “you poor bastards, you’ll leg it if you’ve any sense.”’

‘Thank you for sharing,’ said Maladict.

‘It looks as though everyone’s feeling sorry for us,’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, well, so am I, and I _am_ uth,’ said Igor. ‘Thome of thothe men—’

‘All right, all right, stop lollygagging, you lot!’ shouted Strappi,
marching up.

‘Corporal?’ said the sergeant quietly, hauling himself back on to the
cart. Strappi paused, and then in a voice dripping with syrup and
sarcasm went on: ‘Excuse _me_. The sergeant and myself would be
_obleejed_ if you brave heroes to be would join us in a little light
marching? Jolly good! And there will be embroidery later on. Best foot
forward, ladies!’

Polly heard Tonker gasp. Strappi turned, eyes glinting with sinister
anticipation. ‘Oh, someone doesn’t like being called a _lady_, eh?’ he
said. ‘Dear me, Private Halter, you’ve got a lot to learn, haven’t you?
You’re a sissy little _lady_ until we make a man of you, right? And I
dread to think how long that’s going to take. Move!’

I know, thought Polly, as they set off. It takes about ten seconds, and
a pair of socks. One sock, and you could make Strappi.

Plotz turned out to be like Plün, but it was worse because it was
bigger. The rain started again as they marched into the cobbled square.
It looked as though it always rained here. The buildings were grey, and
mud-spattered near the ground. Roof gutters overflowed, pouring rain on
to the cobbles and sending a spray over the recruits. There was no one
about. Polly saw open doors banging in the wind, and bits of debris in
the streets, and remembered the lines of hurrying people on the road.
There was no one here.

Sergeant Jackrum climbed down from the cart as Strappi bawled them into
line. Then the sergeant took over, leaving the corporal to glower from
the sidelines.

‘This is wonderful Plotz!’ he said. ‘Have a look round, so that if you
is killed and goes to hell, it won’t come as a shock! You’ll be bivvying
in that barracks over there, what is milit’ry property!’ He waved a hand
towards a crumbling stone building that looked about as military as a
barn. ‘You will be issued with your equipment. And tomorrow it’s a nice
long march to Crotz, where you will arrive as boys and leave as men _did
I just say something funny, Perks?_ No, I thought so, too! Attention!
That means stand up straight!’

‘That’s _straight_!’ yelled Strappi.

A young man was riding across the square on a tired, skinny brown horse,
which was quite suitable because he was a tired, skinny man. The
skinniness was helped by the fact that he wore a tunic which had clearly
been made for someone a couple of sizes larger. The same applied to his
helmet. He must have padded it, Polly thought. One cough and it’ll be
over his eyes.

Sergeant Jackrum snapped off a salute as the officer approached.
‘Jackrum, sir. You’ll be Lieutenant Blouse, sir?’

‘Well done, sergeant.’

‘These are the recruits from upriver, sir. Fine body of men, sir.’

The rider peered at the squad. He actually leaned forward over the
horse’s neck, causing rain to pour off his helmet.

‘This is _all_, sergeant?’

‘Yessir.’

‘Most of them look very young,’ said the lieutenant, who didn’t look
very old.

‘Yessir.’

‘And isn’t that one a troll?’

‘Yessir. Well spotted, sir.’

‘And the one with stitches all round his head?’

‘He’s an Igor, sir. Sort of like a special clan up in the mountains,
sir.’

‘Do they fight?’

‘Can take a man apart very quickly, sir, as I understand it,’ said
Jackrum, his expression not changing.

The young lieutenant sighed. ‘Well, I’m sure they’re all good fellows,’
he said. ‘Now then, er . . . men, I—’

‘Pay attention and listen to what the lieutenant has to say!’ bawled
Strappi.

The lieutenant shuddered. ‘—thank you, corporal,’ he said. ‘Men, I have
good news,’ he added, but in the voice of one who hasn’t. ‘You were
probably expecting a week or two in the training camp in Crotz, yes? But
I’m glad to be able to tell you that the . . . the war is progressing so
. . . so . . . so _well_ that you are to go directly to the front.’

Polly heard one or two gasps, and a snigger from Corporal Strappi.

‘_All_ of you are to go to the lines,’ said the lieutenant. ‘That
includes you too, corporal. Your time for action has come at last!’

The snigger stopped. ‘Sorry, sir?’ said Strappi. ‘The front? But you
know that I’m— well, you know about the special duties—’

‘My orders said all able-bodied men, corporal,’ said Blouse. ‘I expect
that you’ll be itching for the fray after all these years, eh, a young
man like you?’

Strappi said nothing.

‘However,’ said the lieutenant, fumbling under his soaking cloak, ‘I do
have a package here for _you_, Sergeant Jackrum. A very welcome one,
I’ve no doubt.’

Jackrum took the packet gingerly. ‘Thank you, sir, I’ll look at this
later on—’ he began.

‘On the contrary, Sergeant Jackrum!’ said Blouse. ‘Your last recruits
should see this, since you are both a soldier and, as it were, a “father
of soldiers”! And so it’s only right that they see a fine soldier get
his reward: _an honourable discharge, sergeant!_’ Blouse spoke the words
as if they had cream and a little cherry on top.

Apart from the rain, the only sound now was Jackrum’s pudgy finger
slowly ripping open the package.

‘Oh,’ he said, like a man in shock. ‘Good. A picture of the Duchess.
That’s _eighteen_ I have now. Oh, and, oo, a piece of paper saying it’s
a medal, so it looks like we’ve even run out of pot metal now. Oh, and
my discharge with a printing of the Duchess’s very own signature
itself!’ He turned the packet over and shook it. ‘Not my three months’
back pay, though.’

‘Three loud hurrahs for Sergeant Jackrum!’ said the lieutenant to the
rain and wind. ‘Hip-hip—’

‘But I thought we needed every man, sir!’ said Jackrum.

‘Judging by all the notes pinned on that packet, it has been following
you around for years, sergeant,’ said Blouse. ‘You know the military.
That is your official discharge, I am afraid. I cannot rescind it. I am
sorry.’

‘But—’ Jackrum began.

‘It bears the Duchess’s signature, sergeant. Will you argue with that? I
said I am sorry. In any case, what would you do? We will not be sending
out any more recruiting parties.’

‘What? But we always need men, sir!’ Jackrum protested. ‘And I’m fit and
well again, got the stamina of a horse—’

‘You were the only man to return with recruits, sergeant. That is how
the matter is.’

The sergeant hesitated for a moment, and then saluted. ‘Yessir! Very
good, sir! Will see the new lads settled in, sir! Pleasure to have
served, sir!’

‘Can I ask something?’ said Maladict.

‘You do not address an officer directly, private,’ snapped Jackrum.

‘No, let the man speak, sergeant,’ said the lieutenant. ‘These are . . .
unusual times, after all. Yes, my man?’

‘Did I hear you say we’re going into battle without training, sir?’

‘Oh, well, most of you will almost certainly be pikemen, haha,’ said the
lieutenant nervously. ‘Not a lot of training there, eh? You just need to
know which end is which, haha.’ He looked as though he wanted to die.

‘Pikemen?’ said Maladict, looking puzzled.

‘You heard the lieutenant, Private Maladict,’ snapped the sergeant.

‘Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,’ said Maladict, stepping back into the ranks.

‘Are there any more questions?’ said Blouse, looking along the line.
‘Jolly good, then. We leave by the last boat, at midnight. Carry on,
sergeant . . . for now. What was the other thing . . . oh, yes. And I
shall need a batman.’

‘Volunteers to be the lieutenant’s batman step forward! _Not you,
Private Maladict!_’ snapped the sergeant.

No one moved.

‘Oh, come now,’ said the lieutenant.

Polly slowly raised a hand. ‘What’s a batman, sir?’

The sergeant grinned mirthlessly. ‘Fair question,’ he said. ‘A batman
is, like, a personal servant who takes care of the officer. Fetches his
meals to him, sees he’s smartly turned out, that style of thing. So’s he
is free to perform his duties more adequatelier.’

Igor stepped forward. ‘Igorth are uthed to thervice, thargeant,’ he
said.

Using the amazing powers of deafness and restricted vision sometimes
available even to the most nervous officers, the lieutenant appeared not
to notice him. He looked fixedly at Polly.

‘What about you, private?’ he said.

‘Private Perks used to work in a bar, sir,’ the sergeant volunteered.

‘Capital. Report to my quarters in the inn at six, Private Perks. Carry
on, sergeant.’

As the skinny horse staggered away, Sergeant Jackrum directed his glare
at the squad, but there was no real fire to it. He appeared to be
operating on automatic, with his mind elsewhere. ‘Don’t just stand there
trying to look pretty! There’s uniforms and weapons inside! Get kitted
up! If you want grub, cook it yerself! At the double! Disssssss_miss_!’

The squad dashed for the barracks, propelled by sheer volume. But Polly
hesitated. Corporal Strappi hadn’t moved since the snigger had been cut
short. He was staring blankly at the ground.

‘You all right, corporal?’ she said.

‘You go away, Parts,’ said the corporal, in a low voice that was much
worse than his normal petulant shout. ‘Just go away, all right?’

She shrugged, and followed the others. But she had noticed the steaming
dampness round the corporal’s feet.

There was chaos inside. The barracks was really just one large room
which did duty as mess, assembly room and kitchen, with big bunk rooms
beyond it. It was empty, and well on the way to decay. The roof leaked,
the high windows were broken, dead leaves had blown in and lay around on
the floor, among the rat droppings. There were no pickets, no sentries,
no people. There was a big pot boiling on the sooty hearth, though, and
its hiss and seethe were the only liveliness in the place. At some point
part of the room had been set up as a kind of quartermaster’s store, but
most of the shelves were empty. Polly had expected some sort of queue,
some kind of order, possibly someone handing out little piles of
clothes.

What there was, instead, was a rummage stall. Very much like a rummage
stall, in fact, because nothing on it appeared to be new and little on
it appeared to be worth having. The rest of the squad were already
pawing through what might have been called merchandise if there were any
possibility that anyone could be persuaded to buy it.

‘_What’s this? One Size, Doesn’t Fit Anyone?_’

‘_This tunic’s got blood on it!_ Blood!’

‘_Well, it is one of the thtubborn thtainth, it’s alwayth very hard to
get it out without_—’

‘_Where’s the proper armour?_’

‘_Oh, no! There’s an arrow hole in this one!_’

‘_What dis? Nuffin fits a troll!_’

A small, leathery old man was at bay behind the table, cowering under
the ferocity of Maladict’s glare. He wore a red uniform jacket, done up
badly, with a corporal’s stripes, stained and faded, on the sleeve. The
left breast was covered in medals.

One arm ended in a hook. One eye was covered by a patch.

‘We’re going to be pikemen, the lieutenant said!’ said the vampire.
‘That means a sword and pike per man, right? And a shield if there’s an
arrow storm, right? And a heavy helmet, right?’

‘Wrong! You can’t yell at me like that!’ said the man. ‘See these
medals? I’m a—’

A hand descended from above and lifted him over the table. Carborundum
held the man close to his face and nodded.

‘Yah, can see ’em, mister,’ he rumbled. ‘And . . . ?’

The recruits had fallen silent.

‘Put him down, Carborundum,’ said Polly. ‘Gently.’

‘Why?’

‘He’s got no legs.’

The troll focused. Then, with exaggerated care, he lowered the old
soldier to the ground. There were a couple of little tapping sounds as
the two wooden peg-legs touched the planking.

‘Sorry about dat,’ he said.

The little man steadied himself against the table and shuffled his arms
round a couple of crutches.

‘All right,’ he said gruffly. ‘No harm done. But watch it, another
time!’

‘But this is ridiculous!’ said Maladict, turning to Polly and waving a
hand at the heap of rags and bent metal. ‘You couldn’t equip three men
out of this mess. There’s not even any decent boots!’

Polly looked along the length of the table. ‘We’re supposed to be well
equipped,’ she said to the one-eyed man. ‘We’re supposed to be the
finest army in the world. That’s what we’re told. And aren’t we
winning?’

The man looked at her. Inside, she stared at herself. She hadn’t meant
to speak out like that.

‘So they say,’ he said, in a blank kind of way.

‘And w-what do _you_ say?’ said Wazzer. He’d picked up one of the few
swords. It was stained and notched.

The corporal glanced up at Carborundum, and then at Maladict.

‘I’m not s-stupid, you know!’ Wazzer went on, red in the face and
trembling. ‘All this stuff is off d-dead men!’

‘Well, it’s a shame to waste good boots—’the man began.

‘We’re the last o-ones, aren’t we?’ said Wazzer. ‘The last r-recruits!’

The peg-legged corporal eyed the distant doorway, and saw no relief
heading in his direction.

‘We’ve got to stay here all night,’ said Maladict. ‘Night!’ he went on,
causing the old corporal to wobble on his crutches. ‘When who knows what
evil flits through the shadows, dealing death on silent wings, seeking a
hapless victim who—’

‘Yeah, all right, all right, I _did_ see your ribbon,’ said the
corporal. ‘Look, I’m closing up after you’ve gone. I just run the
stores, that’s all. That’s all I do, honest! I’m on one-tenth pay, me,
on account of the leg situation, and I don’t want trouble!’

‘And this is all you’ve got?’ said Maladict. ‘Don’t you have a little
something . . . put by . . .’

‘Are you saying I’m dishonest?’ said the corporal hotly.

‘Let’s say I’m open to the idea that you might not be,’ said the
vampire. ‘C’mon, corporal, you said we’re the last to go. What are you
saving up? What’ve you got?’

The corporal sighed, and swung with surprising speed over to a door,
which he unlocked. ‘You’d better come and look,’ he said. ‘But it’s not
good . . .’

It was worse. They found a few more breastplates, but one was sliced in
half and another was one big dent. A shield was in two pieces, too.
There were bent swords and crushed helmets, battered hats and torn
shirts.

‘I done what I can,’ sighed the corporal. ‘I hammered stuff out and
washed out the clothes but it’s been weeks since I had any coal for the
forge and you can’t do nothin’ about the swords without a forge. It’s
been months since I got any new weapons and, let me tell you, since the
dwarfs buggered off the steel we’ve been getting is crap anyway.’ He
rubbed his nose. ‘I know you think quartermasters are a thieving bunch
and I won’t say we might not skim a bit off the top when things are
going well, but this stuff? A beetle couldn’t make a living off this.’
He sniffed again. ‘Ain’t been paid in three months, neither. I guess
one-tenth of nothing is not as bad as nothing, but I was never that good
at philosophy.’

Then he brightened up. ‘Got plenty to eat, at least,’ he said. ‘If you
like horse, that is. Personally I prefer rat, but there’s no accounting
for taste.’

‘I can’t eat horse!’ said Shufti.

‘Ah, you’d be a rat man?’ said the corporal, leading the way out into
the big room.

‘No!’

‘You’ll learn to be one. You’ll _all_ learn,’ said the little one-tenth
corporal, with an evil grin. ‘Ever eaten scubbo? No? Nothing like a bowl
of scubbo when you’re hungry. You can put _anything_ in scubbo. Pork,
beef, mutton, rabbit, chicken, duck . . . anything. Even rats, if you’ve
got ’em. It’s food for the marching man, scubbo. Got some on the boil
out there right now. You can have some of that, if you like.’

The squad brightened up.

‘Thoundth good,’ said Igor. ‘What’th in it?’

‘Boiling water,’ said the corporal. ‘It’s what we call “blind scubbo”.
But there’s going to be old horse in a minute unless you’ve got
something better. Could do with some seasonings, at least. Who’s looking
after the rupert?’

They looked at one another.

The corporal sighed. ‘The officer,’ he explained. ‘They’re all called
Rupert or Rodney or Tristram or something. They get better grub than you
do. You could try scrounging something at the inn.’

‘Scrounge?’ said Polly.

The old man rolled his one eye.

‘Yeah. Scrounge. Scrounge, nick, have a lend of, borrow, thieve, lift,
acquire, purrrr-loin. That’s what you’ll learn, if you’re gonna survive
this war. Which they say we’re winnin’, o’ course. Always remember
that.’ He spat vaguely in the direction of the fire, possibly missing
the cooking pot only by accident. ‘Yeah, an’ all the lads I see coming
back down the road walking hand in hand with Death, they probably
overdid the celebrating, eh? So easy to take your hand right off if you
open a bottle of cham-pag-nee the wrong way, eh? I see you’ve got an
Igor with you, you lucky devils. Wish we’d had one when I went off to
battle. I wouldn’t be kept awake by woodworm if we had.’

‘We have to _steal_ our food?’ said Maladict.

‘No, you can starve if that takes your fancy,’ said the corporal. ‘I’ve
starved a few times. There’s no future in it. Ate a man’s leg when we
were snowed up in the Ibblestarn campaign but, fair’s fair, he ate
mine.’ He looked at their faces. ‘Well, it’s not on, is it, eating your
own leg? You’d probably go blind.’

‘You _swapped_ legs?’ said Polly, horrified.

‘Yeah, me an’ Sergeant Hausegerda. It was his idea. Sensible man, the
sergeant. That kept us alive for the week and by then the relief had got
through. We were certainly relieved about _that_. Oh, dear. Where’s my
manners? How d’yer do, lads, my name’s Corporal Scallot. They call me
Threeparts.’ He held out his hook.

‘But that’s cannibalism!’ said Tonker, backing away.

‘No it’s not, not officially, not unless you eat a whole person,’ said
Threeparts Scallot levelly. ‘Milit’ry rules.’

All eyes turned to the big pot bubbling on the fire.

‘Horse,’ said Scallot. ‘Ain’t got nothing _but_ horse. I _told_ you. I
wouldn’t lie to you, boys. Now kit yerselves up with the best yer can
find. What’s your name, stone man?’

‘Carborundum,’ said the troll.

‘Got a wee bit o’ decent snacking anthracite saved up out the back,
then, and some official red paint for you ’cos I never met a troll yet
that wanted to wear a jacket. The rest of you, mark what I’m telling
yer: fill up with grub. Fill yer pack with grub. Fill yer shako with
grub. Fill yer boots with soup. If any of you run across a pot of
mustard, you hang on to it – it’s amazin’ what mustard’ll help down. And
look after your mates. And keep out of the way of officers, ’cos they
ain’t healthy. That’s what you learn in the army. The enemy dun’t really
_want_ to fight you, ’cos the enemy is mostly blokes like you who want
to go home with all their bits still on. But officers’ll get you
killed.’ Scallot looked round at them. ‘There. I’ve said it. And if
there’s a political amongst you: mister, you can go an’ tell tales and
to hell with you.’

After a few moments of embarrassed silence Polly said: ‘What’s a
political?’

‘Like a spy, only on your own side,’ said Maladict.

‘That’s right,’ said Scallot. ‘There’s one in every battalion these
days, snitching on their mates. Get promotion that way, see? Don’t want
dissent in the ranks, eh? Don’t want loose talk about losing battles,
right? Which is a load of bloody cludgies, ’cos the infantry grumbles
all the time. Moaning is part of _bein’_ a soldier.’ He sighed. ‘Anyway,
there’s a bunkhouse out the back. I beats the pallyarses regular so
there’s probably not too many fleas.’ Once again he looked at blank
faces. ‘That’s straw mattresses to you. Go on, help yourselves. Take
what you like. I’m closing up after you’ve gone, anyway. We _must_ be
winning now you rattling lads are joining, right?’

The clouds had broken when Polly stepped out into the night, and a
half-moon filled the world with cold silver and black. The inn opposite
was another rubbishy alehouse for selling bad beer to soldiers. It stank
of ancient slops, even before she opened the door. The sign was flaked
and unrecognizable, but she could read the name: The World Turned Upside
Down. She pushed open the door. The smell got worse. There were no
customers and no sign of Strappi or Jackrum, but Polly did see a servant
methodically spreading the inn’s dirt evenly across the floor with a
mop.

‘Excuse m—’ she began, and then remembered the socks, raised her voice
and tried to sound angry. ‘Hey, where’s the lieutenant?’

The servant looked at her and gestured up the stairs with a thumb. There
was only one candle alight up there, and she knocked on the nearest
door.

‘Enter.’

She entered. Lieutenant Blouse was standing in the middle of the floor
in his breeches and shirtsleeves, holding a sabre. Polly was no expert
in these matters, but she thought she recognized the stylish, flamboyant
pose as the one beginners tend to use just before they’re stabbed
through the heart by a more experienced fighter.

‘Ah, Perks, isn’t it?’ he said, lowering the blade. ‘Just, er, limbering
up.’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘There’s some laundry in the bag over there. I expect someone in the inn
will do it. What’s for supper?’

‘I’ll check, sir.’

‘What are the men having?’

‘Scubbo, sir,’ said Polly. ‘Possibly with hor—’

‘Then bring me some, will you? We are at war, after all, and I must show
an example to my men,’ said Blouse, sheathing the sword at the third
attempt. ‘That would be good for morale.’

Polly glanced at the table. A book lay open on top of a pile of others.
It looked like a manual of swordsmanship, and the page it was open at
was page five. Beside it was a thick-lensed pair of spectacles.

‘Are you a reading man, Perks?’ said Blouse, closing the book.

Polly hesitated. But, then, what did Ozzer care? ‘A bit, sir,’ she
admitted.

‘I suspect I shall have to leave most of these behind,’ he said. ‘Do
take one if you want it.’ He waved a hand at the books. Polly read the
titles. _The Craft of War_. _Principles of Engagement_. _Battle
Studies_. _Tactical Defence_.

‘All a bit heavy for me, sir,’ she said. ‘Thanks all the same.’

‘Tell me, Perks,’ said Blouse, ‘are the recruits in, er, good spirits?’

He gave her a look of apparently genuine concern. He really did have no
chin, she noticed. His face just eased its way into his neck without
much to disturb it on the way, but his Adam’s apple, now, that was a
champion. It went up and down his neck like a ball on a spring.

Polly had been soldiering for only a couple of days, but already an
instinct had developed. In summary, it was this: lie to officers. ‘Yes,
sir,’ she said.

‘Getting everything they need?’

The aforesaid instinct weighed the chances of their getting anything
more than they’d got already as a result of a complaint, and Polly said,
‘Yes, sir.’

‘Of course, it is not up to us to question our orders,’ said Blouse.

‘Wasn’t doing so, sir,’ said Polly, momentarily perplexed.

‘Even though at times we might feel—’the lieutenant began, and started
again. ‘Obviously warfare is a very volatile thing, and the tide of
battle can change in a moment.’

‘Yessir,’ said Polly, still staring. The man had a small spot where his
spectacles had rubbed on his nose.

The lieutenant seemed to have something on his mind, too. ‘Why did you
join up, Perks?’ he said, groping on the table and finding his
spectacles at the third attempt. He had woollen gloves on, with the
fingers cut out.

‘Patriotic duty, sir!’ said Polly promptly.

‘You lied about your age?’

‘Nosir!’

‘_Just_ patriotic duty, Perks?’

There were lies, and then there were lies. Polly shifted awkwardly.
‘Would quite like to find out what’s happened to my brother Paul, sir,’
she said.

‘Ah, yes.’ Lieutenant Blouse’s face, not a picture of happiness to begin
with, suddenly bore a hunted look.

‘Paul Perks, sir,’ Polly prompted.

‘I’m, er, not really in a position to know, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘I was
working as a . . . I was, er, in charge of, er, I was engaged in special
work back at headquarters, er . . . obviously I don’t know all the
soldiers, Perks. Older brother, w— is he?’

‘Yessir. Joined the Ins-and-Outs last year, sir.’

‘And, er, have you any younger brothers?’ said the lieutenant.

‘No, sir.’

‘Ah, well. That’s something to be thankful for, at any rate,’ said
Blouse. It was a strange thing to say. Polly’s brow wrinkled in
puzzlement.

‘Sir?’ she said.

And then she felt an unpleasant sensation of movement. Something was
slipping slowly down the inside of her thigh.

‘Anything the matter, Perks?’ said the lieutenant, catching her
expression.

‘Nosir! Just a . . . a bit of cramp, sir! All the marching, sir!’ She
clamped both hands around one knee and edged backwards towards the door.
‘I’ll just go and . . . go and see to your supper, sir!’

‘Yes, yes,’ said Blouse, staring at her leg. ‘Yes . . . please . . .’

Polly paused outside the door to pull her socks up, retucked the end of
one under her belt as an anchor, and hurried down to the inn’s kitchens.
A look told her all she wanted to know. Food hygiene here consisted of
making a half-hearted effort not to gob in the stew.

‘I want onions, salt, pepper—’ she began.

The maid who was stirring the soot-black pot on the soot-black stove
glanced up, realized she had been addressed by a man, and hastily pushed
her damp hair out of her eyes.

‘It’s stoo, sir,’ she announced.

‘I don’t want any. I just want the stuff,’ said Polly. ‘For the
officer,’ she added.

The kitchen maid pointed a soot-blackened thumb to a nearby door and
gave Polly what she probably thought was a saucy grin.

‘I’m sure you can have anything that takes your fancy, sir,’ she said.

Polly glanced at the two shelves that had been dignified by the name of
pantry, and grabbed a couple of large onions, one in each hand.

‘May I?’ she said.

‘Oh, sir!’ giggled the maid. ‘I do hope you’re not one of them _coarse_
soldiers who’d take advantage of a helpless maiden, sir!’

‘No, er . . . no. I’m not one of them,’ said Polly.

‘Oh.’ This didn’t seem to be the right answer. The maid put her head on
one side. ‘Have you had _much_ to do with young women, sir?’ she asked.

‘Er . . . yes. Quite a lot,’ said Polly. ‘Er . . . lots, really.’

‘Really?’ The maid drew closer. She smelled mostly of sweat, tinged with
soot. Polly raised the onions as a kind of barrier.

‘I’m sure there’s things you’d like to learn,’ the maid purred.

‘I’m sure there’s something you wouldn’t!’ said Polly, and turned and
ran.

As she made it out into the cold night air, a plaintive voice behind her
called out, ‘I’m off at eight o’clock!’

Ten minutes later, Corporal Scallot was impressed. Polly got the feeling
this did not happen often. Shufti had wedged an old breastplate beside
the fire, had hammered some slabs of horsemeat until they were tender,
dipped them in some flour, and was frying them. The sliced onions
sizzled next to them.

‘I always just boil ’em,’ said Scallot, watching him with interest.

‘You just lose all the flavour if you do that,’ said Shufti.

‘Hey, lad, the stuff I’ve ate, you wouldn’t want to _taste_ it!’

‘Sauté stuff first, especially the onions,’ Shufti went on. ‘Improves
the flavour. Anyway, when you boil you ought to boil slow. That’s what
me mam always says. Roast fast, boil slow, okay? This isn’t bad meat,
for horse. Shame to boil it.’

‘Amazin’,’ said Scallot. ‘We could’ve done with you in Ibblestarn. The
sarge was a good man but a bit, you know, tough in the leg?’

‘A marinade would probably have helped,’ said Shufti absently, flipping
over a slice of meat with a broken sword. He turned to Polly. ‘Was there
any more stuff in the larder, Ozz? I can make up some stock for tomorrow
if we can—’

‘I’m not going in that kitchen again!’ said Polly.

‘Ah, that’d be Roundheels Molly?’ said Corporal Scallot, looking up and
grinning. ‘She’s sent many a lad on his way rejoicing.’ He dipped a
ladle in the boiling scubbo pot next to the pan. Disintegrated grey meat
seethed in a few inches of water.

‘That’ll do for the rupert,’ he said, and picked up a stained bowl.

‘Well, he did say he wanted to eat what the men eat,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, _that_ kind of officer,’ said Scallot uncharitably. ‘Yeah, some
young ones try that stuff, if’n they’ve been readin’ the wrong books.
Some of ’em tries to be _friends_, the bastards.’ He spat expertly
between the two pans. ‘Wait ’til he _tries_ what the men eat.’

‘But if we’re having steak and onions—’

‘No thanks to the likes o’ him,’ said the corporal, ladling the slurry
into the bowl. ‘The Zlobenian troops get one pound of beef and a pound
of flour a day minimum, plus fat pork or butter and half a pound of
pease. A pint o’ molasses sometimes, too. _We_ get stale horse-bread and
what we scrounge. He’ll have scubbo and like it.’

‘No fresh vegetables, no fruit,’ said Shufti. ‘That’s a very binding
diet, corp.’

‘Yeah, well, once battle commences I reckon you’ll find constipation’s
the last thing on your mind,’ said Scallot. He reached up, pushed some
rags aside, and pulled down a dusty bottle from a shelf.

‘Rupert’s not having none o’ this, neither,’ he said. ‘Got it off’f the
baggage of the last officer that went through, but I’ll share it with
you, ’cos you’s good lads.’ He casually knocked the top of the bottle
off against the edge of the chimney. ‘’s only sherry, but it’ll make you
drunk.’

‘Thanks, corp,’ said Shufti, and took the bottle. He sloshed a lot over
the sizzling meat.

‘Hey, that’s good drink you’re wastin’!’ said Scallot, making a grab for
it.

‘No, it’ll spice up the meat a fair treat,’ said Shufti, trying to hang
on to the bottle. ‘It’ll— _sugar!_’

Half the liquid had gone on the fire as the two hands fought for it, but
that wasn’t what had felt like a small steel rod shooting through
Polly’s head. She looked round at the rest of the squad, who didn’t
appear to have—

Maladict winked at her and made a tiny gesture with his head towards the
other end of the room, and strolled in that direction. Polly followed.

Maladict always found something to lounge against. He relaxed in the
shadows, looked up at the rafters, and said: ‘Now, I say a man who knows
how to cook is no less of a man for that. But a man who says “sugar”
when he swears? Have you _ever_ heard a man say that? You haven’t. I can
tell.’

So it _was_ you who gave me the socks, thought Polly. You know about me,
I can tell you do, but do you know about Lofty? And maybe Shufti was
very politely brought up . . . but one look at Maladict’s knowing smile
made her decide not to try that road. Besides, the moment you looked at
Shufti with the idea that maybe he was a girl, you _saw_ that he was. No
man would say ‘Sugar!’ Three girls now . . .

‘And I’m pretty sure about Lofty, too,’ said Maladict.

‘What’re you going to do about . . . them?’ she said.

‘Do? Why should I do anything about anyone?’ said Maladict. ‘I’m a
vampire officially pretending not to be one, right? I’m the last person
who’ll say anyone has to play the hand they were dealt. So good luck to
. . . him, say I. But you might like to take him aside later on and have
a word with him. You know . . . man to man.’

Polly nodded. Was there a knowingness to that comment? ‘I’d better go
and take the lieutenant his scubbo,’ she said. ‘And . . . blast it, I
forgot about his laundry.’

‘Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, old chap,’ said Maladict, and flashed
a little smile. ‘The way things are going around here, Igor’s probably a
washerwoman in disguise.’

* * *

Polly did the laundry, in the end. She wasn’t sure that she’d be able to
dodge Molly a second time, and there wasn’t that much of it. Afterwards
she hung it in front of the fire, which was roaring.

The horse had been surprisingly good, but not as surprising as Blouse’s
reaction to the scubbo. He had sat there in his evening dress uniform –
wearing special clothes just to sit down and eat all by yourself was a
new one on Polly – and had yummed it up and sent her back with the bowl
for more. The meat had been boiled white and there was scum on the top.
The squad wondered what kind of life an officer could have led that
inclined him to like scubbo.

‘Dun’t know much about him,’ said Scallot, upon questioning. ‘He’s been
here two weeks, frettin’ to get to the war. Brought a whole cartload of
books with him, I heard. Looks like a typical rupert to me. They were
all behind the door when the chins were handed out. A sergeant who went
through said he’s not really a soldier at all, just some wonk from
headquarters that’s good at sums.’

‘Oh, great,’ said Maladict, who was brewing his coffee by the fire. The
little engine gurgled and hissed.

‘I don’t think he can see very well without his glasses,’ said Polly.
‘But he’s very, er, polite.’

‘Not been a rupert for long, then,’ said Scallot. ‘They’re more “Hey
there! You! Damn your eyes, fwah fwah fwah!” I seen your sergeant
before, though, old Jackrum. Been everywhere, he has. Everyone knows old
Jackrum. He was with us in the snow up at Ibblestarn.’

‘How many people did _he_ eat?’ said Maladict, to general laughter. The
dinner had been good, and there had still been enough sherry for a glass
each.

‘Let’s just say I heard he didn’t come down much thinner than when he
went up,’ said Scallot.

‘And Corporal Strappi?’ said Polly.

‘Never seen him before, either,’ said Scallot. ‘Crossgrained little
bugger. Political, I’d say. Why’s he gone and left you here? Got a nice
cushy bed in the inn, has he?’

‘I hope _he’s_ not g-going to be our sergeant,’ said Wazzer.

‘Him? Why?’ said Scallot.

Polly volunteered the events of earlier in the evening. To her surprise,
Scallot laughed.

‘They’re trying to get rid of the old bugger again, are they?’ he said.
‘That’s a laugh! Bless you, it’ll take more’n a bunch of gawains and
rodneys to lever Jackrum out of his own army. Why, he’s been
court-martialled twice. He got off both times. And d’you know he once
saved General Froc’s life? He’s been everywhere, got the goods on
everyone, knows more strings than me and I know a good few, mark my
words. If he wants to march with you tomorrow he will, and no skinny
little rupert’ll get in his way.’

‘So what was a man like that doing as a recruiting officer?’ said
Maladict sharply.

‘’cos he got his leg cut open in Zlobenia and bit the sawbones who tried
to look at it when the wound went bad, clever dick,’ retorted Scallot.
‘Cleaned it out himself with maggots and honey, then drank a pint of
brandy and sewed himself up and lay on his bed with a fever for a week.
But the general got him, I heard, came and visited him while he was too
weak to protest and told him he was going on the drumming for a year and
no argument. Not even Froc hisself would hand him his papers, not after
Jackrum’d carried him on his back for fourteen miles through enemy
lines—’

The door swung open and Sergeant Jackrum walked in, tucking his hands
into his belt.

‘Don’t bother to salute, lads,’ he said, as they turned guiltily.
‘Evening, Threeparts. Nice to see nearly all of you again, you artful
ol’ god-dodger. Where’s Corporal Strappi?’

‘Haven’t seen him all evening, sarge,’ said Maladict.

‘Didn’t he come in here with you?’

‘No, sarge. We thought he was with you.’

Not a muscle moved on Jackrum’s face. ‘I see,’ he said. ‘Well, you heard
the lieutenant. The boat leaves at midnight. We should be well down the
Kneck by Wednesday’s dawn. Get a few hours’ sleep if you can. Tomorrow’s
going to be a long day, if you’re lucky.’

And with that, he turned and went out again. Wind howled outside, and
was cut off when the door shut. _We’ll_ be well down the Kneck, Polly
noted. Well done, Threeparts.

‘Missing a corporal?’ said Scallot. ‘Now there’s a thing. Usually it’s a
recruit that goes ay-wole. Well, you heard the sergeant, boys. Time to
wash up and turn in.’

There was a washroom and latrine, in a rough and ready fashion. Polly
found a moment when she and Shufti were in it alone. She’d racked her
brains about how best to raise the subject, but as it turned out just a
look was all it took.

‘It was when I volunteered to do the supper, wasn’t it?’ Shufti mumbled,
staring into the stone sink, which had moss growing in it.

‘That was a clue, yes,’ said Polly.

‘A lot of men cook, you know!’ said Shufti hotly.

‘Yes, but not soldiers, and not enthusiastically,’ said Polly. ‘They
don’t do marinades.’

‘Have you told anybody?’ mumbled Shufti, red in the face.

‘No,’ said Polly, which was, after all, strictly true. ‘Look, you were
good, you had me fooled right up until “sugar”.’

‘Yes, yes, I know,’ Shufti whispered. ‘I can do the belching and the
walking stupidly and even the nose-picking, but I wasn’t brought up to
swear like you men!’

Us men, thought Polly. Oh, boy.

‘We’re the coarse and licentious soldiery. I’m afraid it’s shit or
bust,’ she said. ‘Er . . . _why_ are you doing this?’

Shufti stared into the dank stone sink as if strange green slime was
really interesting, and mumbled something.

‘Sorry, what was that?’ said Polly.

‘Going to find my husband,’ said Shufti, only a little bit louder.

‘Oh, dear. How long had you been married?’ said Polly, without thinking.

‘. . . not married yet . . .’ said Shufti, in a voice as tall as an ant.

Polly glanced down at the plumpness of Shufti. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. She
tried to sound reasonable. ‘Don’t you think that you should—’

‘Don’t you tell me to go home!’ said Shufti, rounding on her. ‘There’s
nothing for me back home except disgrace! I’m not going home! I’m going
to the war and I’m going to find him! No one’s going to tell me not to,
Ozzer! No one! This has happened before, anyway! And it ended right!
There’s a song about it and everything!’

‘Oh, _that_,’ said Polly. ‘Yes. I know.’ Folk singers should be _shot_.
‘What I was _going_ to say was that you might find this helps the
disguise . . .’ She produced a soft cylinder of woolly socks from her
pack and wordlessly handed it over. It was a dangerous thing to do, she
knew, but now she was feeling a kind of responsibility to those whose
sudden strange fancy hadn’t been followed by a plan.

On the way back to her palliasse she caught sight of Wazzer hanging his
little picture of the Duchess on a handy hook in the crumbling wall
above his mattress. He looked around furtively, failed to spot Polly in
the shadows of the doorway, and bobbed a very quick curtsy to the
picture. A curtsy, not a bow.

Polly frowned. Four. She was barely surprised, now. And she had one pair
of clean socks left. This was soon going to be a barefoot army.

Polly could tell the time by the fire. You got a feel for how long a
fire burned, and the logs on this one were grey with ash over the glow
beneath. It was gone eleven, she decided.

By the sound of it, no one was getting any sleep. She’d got up after an
hour or two of lying on the crackling straw mattress, staring at
darkness and listening to things move about underneath her; she’d have
stayed on it for longer, but something in the straw seemed to want to
push her leg out of the way. Besides, she didn’t have any dry blankets.
There _were_ blankets in the barracks, but Threeparts had advised
against them on account of their carrying, as he put it, ‘the Itch’.

The corporal had left a candle alight. Polly had read Paul’s letter
again, and taken another look at the piece of printed paper rescued from
the muddy road. The words were fractured and she wasn’t sure about all
of them, but she didn’t like the sound of any of them. ‘Invas’ had a
particularly unpleasant ring to it.

And then there was the _third_ piece of paper. She couldn’t help that.
It had been a complete accident. She’d done Blouse’s laundry and _of
course_ you went through the pockets before you washed things, because
anyone who’d ever tried to unroll a soggy, bleached sausage that’d once
been a banknote didn’t want to do it twice. And there had been this
folded piece of paper. Admittedly, she needn’t have unfolded it and,
having unfolded it, needn’t have read it. But there are some things that
you just do.

It was a letter. Presumably Blouse had shoved it in a pocket and
forgotten about it when he’d changed his shirt. She needn’t read it
again but, by candlelight, she did.

_My Dearest Emmeline,_

_Fame and Fortune await! After only eight years as a 2nd Lieutenant I
have now been promoted and am to have a command! Of course this will
mean that there will be no officer left in the Adjutant-General’s
Blankets, Bedding and Horse Fodder Department, but I have explained my
new filing system to Cpl Drebb and I believe he is Sound._

_You know I cannot go into matters of detail, but I believe this will be
a very exciting prospect and I am anxious to be ‘at the Foe’. I am bold
enough to hope that the name of Blouse will go down in military history.
In the meantime, I am brushing up my sword drill and it is definitely
all ‘coming back’ to me. Of course, the promotion brings with it no less
than One Shilling extra ‘per Diem’, plus Three Pence fodder allowance.
To this end I have purchased a ‘charger’ from Mr ‘Honest’ Jack Slacker,
a most entertaining gentleman, although I fear that his description of
my steed’s ‘prowess’ may have been prone to some exaggeration.
Nevertheless, I am ‘moving up’ at last and if Fate smiles on me this
will hurry forward the day when I can_

And that was it, fortunately. After some thought, Polly went and
carefully damped the letter, then dried it quickly over the remains of
the fire and slipped it into the pocket of the washed shirt. Blouse
might scold her for not removing it before washing, but she doubted it.

A blanket-counter with a new filing system. An ensign for eight years,
in a war where promotion could be rather fast. A man who put inverted
commas round any word or phrase he thought of as even slightly ‘racy’.
Brushing up on his ‘sword drill’. And so short-sighted he’d bought a
horse from Jack Slacker, who went around all the horse fairs’ bargain
bins and sold winded old screws that dropped a leg before you’d got
home.

_Our leader._

They were losing the war. Everyone knew that, but nobody would say it.
It was as if they felt that if the words weren’t said out loud then it
wasn’t really happening. They were losing the war and this squad,
untrained and untried, fighting in dead men’s boots, could only help
them lose it faster. Half of them were girls! Because of some bloody
stupid song, Shufti was wandering off into a war to look for the father
of her child, and that was a desperate errand for a girl even in
peacetime. And Lofty was trailing after her boy, which would probably be
romantic right up until five minutes into a battle. And she . . .

. . . well, yes. She’d heard the song, too. So what? Paul was her
brother. She’d always kept an eye on him, even when she was small.
Mother was always busy, _everyone_ was always busy at The Duchess, so
Polly had become a big sister to a brother fifteen months older than
her. She’d taught him to blow his nose, taught him how to form letters,
went and found him when crueller boys had got him lost in the woods.
Running after Paul was a duty that had become a habit.

And then . . . well, it wasn’t the only reason. When her father died The
Duchess would be lost to her side of the family if there was no male to
inherit. That was the law, plain and simple. Nugganatic law said that
men could inherit ‘the Things of Men’ such as land, buildings, money and
all domestic animals except cats. Women could inherit ‘the Things of
Women’, which were mostly small items of personal jewellery and spinning
wheels passed from mothers to daughters. They certainly couldn’t inherit
a large, famous tavern.

So The Duchess would go to Paul if he was alive, or if he was dead it
was allowable for it to go to Polly’s husband if she was married. And
since Polly saw no prospect of that, she _needed_ a brother. Paul could
happily carry barrels around for the rest of his life; she would run The
Duchess. But if she was left alone, a woman with no man, then at best
all she’d get was maybe the chance to go on living there while the deeds
went to cousin Vlopo, who was a drunkard.

Of course, all that wasn’t _the_ reason. Certainly not. But it was a
reason, all the same. _The_ reason was, simply, Paul. She’d always found
him and brought him home.

She looked at the shako in her hands. There had been helmets, but since
they all had arrow holes or gaping rips in them the squad had wordlessly
gone for the softer hats. You’d die anyway, and at least you wouldn’t
have a headache. The shako’s badge showed the regimental symbol of a
flaming cheese. Maybe one day she’d find out why. Polly put it on,
picked up her pack and the small bag of laundry, and stepped out into
the night. The moon was gone, the clouds had come back. She was drenched
by the time she’d crossed the square; the rain was coming horizontally.

She shoved open the inn door and saw, by the light of one guttering
candle . . . chaos. Clothing was strewn across the flagstones, cupboards
were hanging open. Jackrum was coming down the stairs, cutlass in one
hand, lantern in the other.

‘Oh, it’s you, Perks,’ he said. ‘They’ve cleaned the place out and
buggered off. Even Molly. I heard ’em go. Pushing a cart, by the sound
of it. What’re you doing here?’

‘Batman, sarge,’ said Polly, shaking water off her hat.

‘Oh, yeah. Right. Go and wake him up, then. He’s snoring like a sawmill.
I hope to hell the boat’s still there.’

‘Why’d they bug— scarper, sarge?’ said Polly and thought: Sugar! If it
comes to it, _I_ don’t swear, either! But the sergeant didn’t appear to
notice.

He gave her what is known as an old-fashioned look; this one had
dinosaurs in it. ‘Got wind of something, I don’t doubt,’ he said. ‘Of
course, we’re winning the war, you know.’

‘Ah. Oh. And we’re not going to be invaded at all, I expect,’ said
Polly, with equally exaggerated care.

‘Quite right. I detest those treacherous devils who’d have us believe
that a vast army is about to sweep right across the country any day
now,’ said Jackrum.

‘Er . . . no sign of Corporal Strappi, sarge?’

‘No, but I haven’t turned over every stone yet— ssh!’

Polly froze, and strained to listen. There were hoof-beats, getting
louder as they approached, and changing from thuds into the ringing
sound of horseshoes on cobbles.

‘Cavalry patrol,’ Jackrum whispered, putting the lantern down on the
bar. ‘Six or seven horses.’

‘Ours?’

‘I bleedin’ doubt it.’

The clattering slowed, and came to a stop outside.

‘Keep ’em talking,’ said Jackrum, reaching down and sliding the door’s
bolt across. He turned and headed towards the rear of the inn.

‘What? _What about?_’ whispered Polly. ‘Sarge?’

Jackrum had vanished. Polly heard murmuring outside the door, followed
by a couple of sharp knocks.

She threw off her jacket. She wrenched the shako off her head and tossed
it behind the bar. Now she wasn’t a soldier, at least. And, as the door
was shaken against the bolt, she saw something white lying in the
debris. It was a terrible temptation . . .

The door burst open at the second blow, but the soldiers didn’t
immediately enter. Lying under the bar, struggling to put the petticoat
on over rolled-up trousers, Polly tried to make sense of the sounds. As
far as she could tell from the rustles and thuds, anyone waiting inside
the doorway with ambush in mind would have been briefly and terminally
sorry. She tried to count the invaders; it sounded as though there were
at least three. In the tense silence, the sound of a voice speaking in
normal tones came as a shock.

‘We heard the bolt slide across. That means you’re in here somewhere.
Make it easy on yourself. We don’t want to have to come and find you.’

I don’t want you to either, Polly thought. I’m not a soldier! Go away!
And then the next thought was: _What do you mean, you’re not a soldier?
You took the shilling and kissed the picture, didn’t you?_ And suddenly
an arm had reached under the bar and grabbed her. At least she didn’t
have to act.

‘No! Please, sir! Don’t hurt me! I just got frightened! Please!’

But inside there was a certain . . . sock-ness that felt ashamed, and
wanted to kick out.

‘Ye gods, what are you?’ said the cavalryman, pulling her upright and
looking at her as if she was some kind of exhibit.

‘Polly, sir! Barmaid, sir! Only they cleared out and left me!’

‘Keep the noise down, girl!’

Polly nodded. The last thing she needed now was for Blouse to run down
the stairs with his sabre and _Fencing for Beginners_.

‘Yes, sir,’ she squeaked.

‘Barmaid, eh? Three pints of what you’d probably call your finest ale,
then.’

That at least could happen on automatic. She’d seen the mugs under the
bar, and the barrels were behind her. The beer was thin and sharp but
probably wouldn’t dissolve a penny.

The cavalryman watched her closely as she filled the mugs. ‘What
happened to your hair?’ he said.

Polly had been ready for this. ‘Oh, sir, they cut it off, sir! ’cos I
smiled at a Zlobenian trooper, sir!’

‘Here?’

‘In Drok, sir.’ It was a town much nearer the border. ‘And me mam said
it was shaming to the family and I got sent here, sir!’

Her hands shook as she put the mugs on the bar, and she was hardly
exaggerating. Hardly . . . but a bit, nevertheless. _You’re acting like
a girl_, she thought. _Keep it up!_

Now she could take stock of the invaders. They wore dark-blue uniforms,
and big boots, and heavy cavalry helmets. One of them was standing by
the shuttered windows. The other two were watching her. One had a
sergeant’s stripes and an expression of deep suspicion. The one who’d
grabbed her was a captain.

‘This is terrible beer, girl,’ he said, sniffing the mug.

‘Yes, sir, I know, sir,’ Polly gabbled. ‘They wouldn’t listen to me,
sir, and said you have to put a damp sheet over the barrels in this
thundery weather, sir, and Molly never cleans the spigot and—’

‘This town’s empty, you know that?’

‘They all scarpered, sir,’ said Polly earnestly. ‘Gonna be an invasion,
sir. Everyone says. They’re frightened of you, sir.’

‘Except you, eh?’ said the sergeant.

‘What’s your name, girl who smiles at Zlobenian troopers?’ said the
captain, smiling.

‘Polly, sir,’ said Polly. Her questing hand found what it was seeking
under the bar. It was the barman’s friend. There always was one.

‘And are _you_ frightened of me, Polly?’ said the captain. There was a
snigger from the soldier by the window.

The captain had a well-trimmed moustache which had been waxed to points,
and was over six feet tall, Polly reckoned. He had a pretty smile, too,
which was somehow improved by the scar on his face. A circle of glass
covered one eye. Her hand gripped the hidden cudgel.

‘No, sir,’ she said, looking back into one eye and one glass. ‘Er . . .
what’s that glass for, sir?’

‘It’s a monocle,’ said the captain. ‘It helps me see you, for which I am
eternally grateful. I always say that if I had two I’d make a spectacle
of myself.’

That got a dutiful laugh from the sergeant. Polly looked blank.

‘And are you going to tell me where the recruits are?’ said the captain.

She forced her expression not to change. ‘No.’

The captain smiled. He had good teeth, but there was, now, no warmth in
his eyes.

‘You are in no position to be ignorant,’ he said. ‘We won’t hurt them, I
assure you.’

There was a scream in the distance.

‘Much,’ said the sergeant, with more satisfaction than was necessary.
There was another yell. The captain nodded to the man by the door, who
slipped out. Polly pulled the shako out from under the bar and put it
on.

‘One of them gave you his cap, did he?’ said the sergeant, and his teeth
were nowhere near as good as the officer’s. ‘Well, I like a girl who’ll
smile at a soldier—’

The cudgel hit him along the head. It was old blackthorn, and he went
down like a tree. The captain backed away as Polly came out from behind
the bar with the club readied again. But he hadn’t drawn his sword, and
he was _laughing_.

‘Now, girl, if you want—’ He caught her arm as she swung, dragged her
towards him in a tight grip, still laughing, and folded up almost
silently as her knee connected with his sock drawer. Thank you, Gummy.
As he sagged she stepped back and brought the cudgel down on his helmet,
making it ring.

She was shaking. She felt sick. Her stomach was a small, red-hot lump.
What else could she have done? Was she supposed to think _We have met
the enemy and he is nice?_ Anyway, he wasn’t. He was smug.

She tugged a sabre from a scabbard and crept out into the night. It was
still raining, and waist-deep mist was drifting up from the river. Half
a dozen or so horses were outside, but not tied up. A trooper was
waiting with them. Faintly, against the rustle of the rain, she heard
him making soothing noises to comfort one of them. She wished she hadn’t
heard that. Well, she’d taken the shilling. Polly gripped the cudgel.

She’d gone a step when the mist between her and the man fountained up
slowly as something rose out of it. The horses shifted uneasily. The man
turned, a shadow moved, the man fell . . .

‘Oi!’ whispered Polly.

The shadow turned. ‘Ozzer? It’s me, Maladict,’ it said. ‘Sarge sent me
to see if you needed help.’

‘Bloody Jackrum left me surrounded by armed men!’ Polly hissed.

‘And?’

‘Well, I . . . knocked two of them out,’ she said, feeling as she said
it that this rather spoilt her case as a victim. ‘One went over the
road, though.’

‘I think we got that one,’ said Maladict. ‘Well, I say “got” . . .
Tonker nearly gutted him. There’s a girl with what I’d call unresolved
issues.’ He turned round. ‘Let’s see . . . seven horses, seven men.
Yep.’

‘_Tonker?_’ said Polly.

‘Oh, yes. Hadn’t you spotted her? She went mad when the man charged at
Lofty. Now, let’s have a look at your gentlemen, shall we?’ said
Maladict, heading for the inn door.

‘But Lofty and Tonker . . .’ Polly began, running to keep up. ‘I mean,
the way they act, they . . . I thought she was his girl . . . but I
thought Tonker . . . I mean, I know Lofty is a gi—’

Even in the dark, Maladict’s teeth gleamed as he smiled. ‘The world’s
certainly unfolding itself for you, eh? _Ozzer?_ Every day, something
new. Cross-dressing now, I see.’

‘What?’

‘You are wearing a _petticoat_, Ozzer,’ said Maladict, stepping into the
bar. Polly looked down guiltily and started to tug it off, and then
thought: hang on a moment . . .

The sergeant had managed to pull himself up against the bar, where he
was being sick. The captain was groaning on the floor.

‘Good evening, gentlemen!’ said the vampire. ‘Please pay attention. I am
a _reformed_ vampire, which is to say, I am a bundle of suppressed
instincts held together with spit and coffee. It would be wrong to say
that violent, tearing carnage does not come easily to me. It’s _not_
tearing your throats out that doesn’t come easily to me. Please don’t
make it any harder.’

The sergeant pushed himself away from the bar top and took a muzzy swing
at Maladict. Almost absentmindedly, Maladict leaned away from it and
then returned a roundhouse blow that knocked him over.

‘The captain looks bad,’ he said. ‘What did he try to do to poor little
you?’

‘Patronize me,’ said Polly, glaring at Maladict.

‘Ah,’ said the vampire.

Maladict knocked softly on the barracks door. It opened a fraction, and
then all the way. Carborundum lowered his club. Wordlessly, Polly and
Maladict dragged the two cavalrymen inside. Sergeant Jackrum was sitting
on a stool by the fire, drinking a mug of beer.

‘Well done, lads,’ he said. ‘Put ’em with the others.’ He waved the mug
vaguely towards the far wall, where four of the soldiers were hunched
sullenly under the gaze of Tonker. They had been manacled together. The
last soldier was lying on a table, with Igor at work on him with a
needle and thread.

‘How’s he coming along, private?’ said Jackrum.

‘He’ll be fine, tharge,’ said Igor. ‘It looked worthe than it wath,
really. Jutht ath well, because until we get to the battlefield I won’t
get any thpareth.’

‘Got a couple of legs for ol’ Threeparts?’ said Jackrum.

‘Now then, sarge, none of that,’ said Scallot evenly. He was sitting on
the other side of the fireplace. ‘You just leave me their horses and
saddles. Your lads could do with their sabres, I’ve no doubt.’

‘They were looking for _us_, sarge,’ said Polly. ‘We’re just a bunch of
untrained recruits and they were _looking_ for us. I could’ve been
_killed_, sarge!’

‘No, I know talent when I sees it,’ said Jackrum. ‘Well done, lad. Had
to piss off myself, on account of a big man in full enemy uniform isn’t
easy to miss. Besides, you lads needed to be woke up. That’s _milit’ry
thinking_, that is.’

‘But if I hadn’t . . .’ Polly hesitated. ‘If I hadn’t tricked them, they
might’ve killed the lieutenant!’

‘See? There’s always a positive side, any way you look at it,’ said
Scallot.

The sergeant stood up, wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and
hitched up his belt. He ambled over to the captain, reached down, and
lifted him up by his jacket.

‘Why were you looking for these boys, sir?’ he enquired.

The captain opened his eye and focused on the fat man.

‘I am an officer and a gentleman, sergeant,’ he muttered. ‘There are
_rules_.’

‘Not many gentlemen around here at this moment, sir,’ said the sergeant.

‘Damn right,’ whispered Maladict. Polly, feeling drunk with relief and
released tension, had to put her hand over her mouth to stop giggling.

‘Oh, yeah. The rules. Prisoners of war and that,’ Jackrum went on. ‘That
means you even have to eat the same things as us, you poor devils. So
you’re not going to talk to me?’

‘I am . . . Captain Horentz of the First Heavy Dragoons. I’ll say
nothing more.’ And something about the way he said it elbowed Polly in
the brain. _He’s lying_.

Jackrum stared at him blankly for a moment, and then said: ‘Well, now
. . . it looks like what we have here is an embuggerance which, my lads
of the Cheesemongers, is defined as an obstruction in the way of
progress. I propose to deal with it in this wise!’ He let go of the
man’s jacket and the captain fell back.

Sergeant Jackrum removed his hat. Then he removed his jacket, too,
revealing a stained shirt and bright red braces. He was still almost
spherical; from his neck, folds of skin lapped their way down to the
tropical regions. The belt must have been there just to conform to
regulations, Polly thought.

He reached up and undid a piece of string from around his neck. It was
looped through a hole in a tarnished coin.

‘Corporal Scallot!’ he said.

‘Yes, sarge!’ said Scallot, saluting.

‘You will note I am divestering myself of my insignia and am handing you
my official shilling, which means, since last time I signed up it was
for twelve years and that was sixteen years ago, I am now fully and
legally a damn civilian!’

‘Yes, Mister Jackrum,’ said Scallot cheerfully. Among the prisoners,
heads jerked up at the sound of the name.

‘And that being the case, and since you, captain, are invading our
country by night under the cover of darkness, and I am a humble
civilian, I think there’s no rule to stop me beating seven kinds of crap
out of you until you tell me why you came here and when the rest of your
mates are going to arrive. And that may take me some time, sir, because
up until now I’ve only ever discovered five types of crap.’ He rolled up
his sleeves, hauled up the captain again and drew back a fist—

‘We just had to take the recruits into custody,’ said a voice. ‘We
weren’t going to hurt them! Now put him down, Jackrum, damn you! He’s
still seeing stars!’

It was the sergeant from the inn. Polly looked at the other prisoners.
Even with Carborundum and Maladict watching them, and Tonker glowering
at them, there was a definite sense that the first blow landed on the
captain was going to start a riot. And Polly thought: they _are_ very
protective, aren’t they . . .

Jackrum must have picked it up, too. ‘Ah, now we’re talking,’ he said,
lowering the captain gently but still holding his coat. ‘Your men speak
up for you well, captain.’

‘That’s because we’re not slaves, you bloody beeteater,’ growled one of
the troopers.

‘Slaves? All my lads joined up of their own free will, turniphead.’

‘Maybe they _thought_ they did,’ said the sergeant. ‘You just lied to
’em. Lied to ’em for years. They’re all gonna die because of your stupid
lies! Lies and your raddled, rotting, lying old whore of a duchess!’

‘_Private Goom, as you were! That is an order! As you were, I said!
Private Maladict, take that sword off’f Private Goom! That is another
order! Sergeant, order your men to ease back slowly! Slowly! Do it now!
Upon my oath I am not a violent man, but any man,_ any _man who disobeys
me, bigod, that man is lookin’ at a broken rib!_’

Jackrum screamed all that in one long explosion of sound without taking
his eyes off the captain.

Reaction, order and breathless stillness had taken just a few seconds.
Polly stared at the sudden tableau as her muscles untensed.

The Zlobenian troopers were settling back. Carborundum’s raised club
began to lower itself gently. Little Wazzer was held off the ground by
Maladict, who’d wrenched a sword from her hand; possibly only a vampire
could have moved faster than Wazzer as she’d charged the prisoners.

‘Custody,’ said Jackrum, in a quiet voice. ‘That’s a funny word. Look at
my little lads, will you? Not a whisker between them yet, save for the
troll, and lichen don’t count. Still wet behind the ears, they are.
What’s dangerous about a harmless bunch of farm boys that’d concern a
fine bunch of horse-wallopers like yourselves?’

‘Can thomeone pleathe come and put their finger on thith knot?’ said
Igor, from his makeshift operating table. ‘I’ve jutht about done.’

‘_Harmless?_’ said the sergeant, staring at the struggling Wazzer.
‘They’re a bunch of bloody madmen!’

‘I want to speak to your officer, damn you,’ said the captain, who
looked a little less unfocused now. ‘You do have an officer, don’t you?’

‘Yeah, we’ve got one somewhere, as I recall,’ said Jackrum. ‘Perks, go
and fetch the rupert, will you? Best if you take that dress off first,
too. You never know, with ruperts.’ He carefully lowered the captain on
to a bench, and straightened up.

‘Carborundum, Maladict, chop something off any prisoner who moves, and
any man who tries to attack a prisoner!’ he said. ‘Now then . . . oh,
yes. Threeparts Scallot, I wish to enlist in your wonderful army, with
its many opportunities for a young man willing to apply himself.’

‘Any previous soldierin’?’ said Scallot, grinning.

‘Forty years fighting every bleeder within a hundred miles of
Borogravia, corporal.’

‘Special skills?’

‘Stayin’ alive, corporal, come what may.’

‘Then allow me to present you with one shilling and immediate
acceleration to the rank of sergeant,’ said Scallot, handing back the
coat and the shilling. ‘Want to Osculate the Doxie?’

‘Not at my time o’ life,’ said Jackrum, putting on his jacket again.
‘There,’ he said. ‘All smart, all neat, all legal. Go on, Perks, I gave
you an order.’

Blouse was snoring. His candle had burned down. A book was open on his
blanket. Polly gently pulled it out from under his fingers. The title,
almost invisible on the stained cover, was: _Tacticus: The Campaigns_.

‘Sir?’ she whispered.

Blouse opened his eyes, saw her, and then turned and frantically
scrabbled by the bed.

‘Here they are, sir,’ said Polly, handing him his spectacles.

‘Ah, Perks, thank you,’ said the lieutenant, sitting up. ‘Midnight, is
it?’

‘A bit after, sir.’

‘Oh, dear! Then we must hurry! Quick, pass me my breeches! Have the men
had a good night?’

‘We were attacked by Zlobenian troops, sir. First Heavy Dragoons. We
took them prisoner, sir. No casualties, sir.’ . . . because they didn’t
expect us to fight. They wanted to take us alive. And they walked in on
Carborundum and Maladict and . . . me.

It had been hard, very hard, to force herself to swing that cudgel. But
once she had done it, it had been easy. And then she’d felt embarrassed
about being caught in a petticoat, even though she had her breeches on
underneath. She’d gone from boy to girl just by thinking it, and it had
been so . . . easy. She needed some time to consider this. She needed
time to think about a lot of things. She suspected that time was going
to be in short supply.

Blouse was still sitting there with his breeches half on, staring at
her.

‘Run that past me again one more time, will you, Perks?’ he said. ‘You
have _captured_ some of the enemy?’

‘Not just me, sir, I only got two of ’em,’ said Polly. ‘We all, er,
piled in, sir.’

‘_Heavy Dragoons?_’

‘Yessir.’

‘That’s the Prince’s personal regiment! They’ve invaded?’

‘I think it was more of a patrol, sir. Seven men.’

‘And none of you are hurt?’

‘Nosir.’

‘Pass me my shirt! Oh, blast!’

It was then that Polly noticed the bandage around his right hand. It was
red with blood. He saw her expression.

‘Bit of a self-inflicted wound, Perks,’ he said nervously. ‘“Brushing
up” on my sword drill after supper. Nothing serious. Just a bit “rusty”,
you know. Can’t quite manage buttons. If you would be so good . . .’

Polly helped the lieutenant struggle into the rest of his clothes, and
threw his few other possessions in a bag. It took a special kind of man,
she reflected, to cut his sword hand with his own sword.

‘I should pay my bill . . .’ the lieutenant muttered, as they hurried
down the darkened stairs.

‘Can’t, sir. Everyone’s fled, sir.’

‘Perhaps I should leave them a note, do you think? I wouldn’t like them
to think that I had “done a runner” without—’

‘They’ve all _gone_, sir!’ said Polly, pushing him towards the front
door. She stopped outside the barracks, straightened his coat and stared
at his face. ‘Did you wash last night, sir?’

‘There was no—’ Blouse began.

The response was automatic. Even though she was fifteen months younger,
she’d been mothering Paul for too long.

‘Handkerchief!’ she demanded. And, since some things get programmed into
the brain at an early age, one was obediently produced.

‘Spit!’ Polly commanded. Then she used the damp hanky to wipe a mark off
Blouse’s face and realized, as she was doing it, that she was doing it.
There was no going back. The only way out was ahead.

‘All right,’ she said brusquely. ‘Have you got everything?’

‘Yes, Perks.’

‘Have you been to the privy this morning?’ her mouth went on, while her
brain cowered in fear of a court martial. I’m in shock, she thought, and
so’s he. So you cling to what you know. And you can’t stop . . .

‘No, Perks,’ said the lieutenant.

‘Then you must go properly before we get on the boat, all right?’

‘Yes, Perks.’

‘In you go, then, there’s a good lieutenant.’

She leaned against the wall and got her breath back in a few hurried
gulps as Blouse stepped into the barracks, then slipped in after him.

‘Officer present!’ Jackrum barked. The squad, already lined up, stood to
varying degrees of attention. The sergeant jerked a salute in front of
Blouse, causing the young man to sway backwards.

‘Apprehended enemy scouting party, sir! Dangerous business all round,
sir! In view of the emergency nature of the emergency sir, and seeing as
how you have no NCO what with Corporal Strappi having scarpered, and
seeing as how I’m an old soldier in good standing, you are allowed to
conscript me as an auxiliary under Duchess’s Regulations, Rule 796,
Section 3 [a], Paragraph ii, sir, thank you, sir!’

‘What?’ said Blouse, staring around blearily and becoming aware that in
a world of sudden turmoil there was a big red coat that seemed to know
what it was doing. ‘Oh. Yes. Fine. Rule 796, you say? Absolutely. Well
done. Carry on, sergeant.’

‘Are you in command here?’ barked Horentz, standing.

‘Indeed I am, captain,’ said Blouse.

Horentz looked him up and down. ‘_You?_’ he said, disdain oozing from
the word.

‘Indeed, sir,’ said Blouse, his eyes narrowing.

‘Oh well, we shall have to do what we can. That fat bastard,’ said
Horentz, pointing a threatening finger at Jackrum, ‘that bastard offered
me violence! As a prisoner! In _chains_! And that . . . _boy_,’ the
captain added, spitting the word towards Polly, ‘kicked me in the
privates and almost clubbed me to death! I _demand_ that you let us go!’

Blouse turned to Polly. ‘Did you kick Captain Horentz in the “privates”,
Parts?’

‘Er . . . yessir. Kneed, actually. And it’s Perks actually, sir,
although I can see why you made the mistake.’

‘What was he doing at the time?’

‘Er . . . embracing me, sir.’ Polly saw Blouse’s eyebrows rise, and
plunged on. ‘I was temporarily disguised as a girl, sir, in order to
allay suspicion.’

‘And then you . . . clubbed him?’

‘Yessir. Once, sir.’

‘What in the world possessed you to stop at once?’ said Blouse.

‘Sir?’ said Polly, as Horentz gasped. Blouse turned with an almost
seraphic look of pleasure on his face.

‘And you, sergeant,’ he went on, ‘did you in fact lay a hand on the
captain?’

Jackrum took a step forward and saluted smartly. ‘Not as in fact per se
and such, sir, no,’ he said, keeping his eyes fixed on a point some
twelve feet high on the far wall. ‘I just considered, since he had
invaded our country to capture our lads, sir, that it wouldn’t hurt if
he experienced temporary feelings of shock and awe, sir. On my oath,
sir, I am not a violent man.’

‘Of course not, sergeant,’ said Blouse. And now, while he still smiled,
it was edged with a kind of malevolent glee.

‘For heaven’s sake, you fool, you can’t believe these ignorant yokels,
they’re the dregs of—’ Horentz began.

‘I do believe them, indeed I do,’ said Blouse, shaking with nervous
defiance. ‘I would believe their testimony against yours, sir, if they
told me the sky was green. And it would appear that untrained as they
are, they have bested some of Zlobenia’s finest soldiers by wit and
daring. I have every confidence that they have further surprises in
store for us—’

‘_Dropping your drawers would do it_,’ whispered Maladict.

‘_Shutup!_’ hissed Polly, and then had to cram a fist into her mouth
again.

‘I know you, Captain Horentz,’ said Blouse, and just for a moment the
captain looked worried. ‘I mean I know your sort. I’ve had to put up
with them all my life. Big jovial bullies, with their brains in their
breeches. You _dare_ to come riding into our country and think we’re
going to be frightened of you? You think you can appeal to me over the
heads of my men? You _demand_? On the soil of my country?’

‘Captain?’ murmured the cavalry sergeant, as Horentz stared open-mouthed
at the lieutenant, ‘they’ll be here soon . . .’

‘Ah,’ said Horentz uncertainly. Then he seemed, with some effort, to
regain his composure. ‘Reinforcements are coming,’ he snapped. ‘Free us
now, you idiot, and I might just put this down to native stupidity.
Otherwise I shall see to it that things go very, very badly for you and
your . . . ha . . . men.’

‘Seven cavalrymen were considered not enough to deal with farm boys?’
said Blouse. ‘You’re sweating, captain. You are _worried_. And yet you
have reinforcements coming?’

‘Permission to speak, sir!’ barked Jackrum, and went straight on to:
‘_Cheesemongers! Get bleedin’ armed again right now! Maladict, you give
Private Goom his sword back an’ wish him luck! Carborundum, you grab a
handful of them twelve-foot pikes! The rest of_—’

‘There’s these as well, sarge,’ said Maladict. ‘Lots of them. I got them
off our friends’ saddles.’ He held up what looked to Polly like a couple
of large pistol crossbows, steely and sleek.

‘Horsebows?’ said Jackrum, like a child opening a wonderful Hogswatch
present. ‘That’s what you gets for leading an honest and sober life, my
lads. Dreadful little engines they are. Let’s have two each!’

‘I don’t want unnecessary violence, sergeant,’ said Blouse.

‘Right you are, sir!’ said the sergeant. ‘Carborundum! First man comes
through that door runnin’, I want him nailed to the wall!’ He caught the
lieutenant’s eye, and added: ‘But not too hard!’

. . . and someone did knock at the door.

Maladict levelled two bows at it. Carborundum lifted a couple of pikes
in either hand. Polly raised her cudgel, a weapon she at least knew how
to use. The other boys, and girls, raised whatever weapon Threeparts
Scallot had been able to procure. There was silence. Polly looked
around.

‘Come in?’ she suggested.

‘Yeah, right, that should do it,’ said Jackrum, rolling his eyes.

The door was pushed open and a small, dapper man stepped through
carefully. In build, colouring and hairstyle he looked rather like Mala—

‘A vampire?’ said Polly softly.

‘Oh, damn,’ said Maladict.

The newcomer’s clothing, however, was unusual. It was an old-fashioned
evening dress coat with the sleeves removed and many, many pockets sewn
all over it. In front of him, slung around his neck, was a large black
box. Against all common sense, he beamed at the sight of a dozen weapons
poised to deliver perforated death.

‘Vonderful!’ he said, lifting up the box and unfolding three legs to
form a tripod for it. ‘But . . . could zer troll move a little to his
left please?’

‘Huh?’ said Carborundum. The squad looked at one another.

‘Yes, and if the sergeant vould be so kind as to move into the centre
more, and raise those swords a little bit higher?’ the vampire went on.
‘Great! And you, sir, if you could give me a grrrrh . . . ?’

‘Grrrrh?’ said Blouse.

‘Very good! Really fierce now . . .’

There was a blinding flash and a brief cry of ‘Oh, sh—’, followed by the
tinkle of breaking glass.

Where the vampire had been standing was a little cone of dust. Blinking,
Polly watched it fountain up into a human shape which coalesced once
more into the vampire.

‘Oh dear, I really thought ze new filter vould do it,’ he said. ‘Oh
vell, ve live und learn.’ He gave them a bright smile and added, ‘Now –
vhich vun of you is Captain Horentz, please?’

Half an hour had passed. Polly was still bewildered. The trouble was not
that she didn’t understand what was going on. The problem was that
before she could understand that, she had to understand a lot of other
things. One of them was the concept of a ‘newspaper’.

Blouse was looking proud and worried by turns, but nervous all the time.
Polly watched him carefully, not least because he was talking to the man
who had come in behind the iconographer. He was wearing a big leather
coat and jodhpurs, and spent most of the time writing things down in a
notebook, with occasional puzzled glances at the squad. Finally,
Maladict, who had good hearing, sauntered over to the recruits from his
lounging spot by the wall.

‘Okay,’ he said, lowering his voice. ‘It’s all a bit complicated, but
. . . do any of you know about newspapers?’

‘Yeth, my thecond couthin Igor in Ankh-Morpork told me about them,’ said
Igor. ‘They’re like a kind of government announthement.’

‘Um . . . sort of. Except they’re not written by the government. They’re
written by ordinary people who write things down,’ said Maladict.

‘Like a diary?’ said Tonker.

‘Um . . . no . . .’

Maladict tried to explain. The squad tried to understand. It still made
no sense. It sounded to Polly like some kind of Punch and Judy show.
Anyway, why would you trust anything written down? She certainly didn’t
trust ‘Mothers of Borogravia!’ and that was from the _government_. And
if you couldn’t trust the government, who _could_ you trust?

Very nearly everyone, come to think of it . . .

‘Mr de Worde works for a newspaper in Ankh-Morpork,’ said Maladict. ‘He
says we’re losing. He says casualties are mounting and troops are
deserting and all the civilians are heading for the mountains.’

‘W-why should we believe him?’ Wazzer demanded.

‘Well, we’ve seen a lot of casualties and refugees and Corporal Strappi
hasn’t been around since he heard he was going to the front,’ said
Maladict. ‘Sorry, but it’s true. We’ve all seen it.’

‘Yeah, but he’s just some man from a foreign country. Why w-would the
Duchess lie to us? I mean, why would she send us out just to die?’ said
Wazzer. ‘She w-watches over us!’

‘Everyone says we’re winning,’ said Tonker, doubtfully, after that
moment of embarrassment. Tears were running down Wazzer’s face.

‘No, they don’t,’ said Polly. ‘I don’t think we are, either.’

‘Does _anyone_ think we are?’ said Maladict. Polly looked from face to
face.

‘But saying so . . . it’s like treachery against the Duchess, isn’t it?’
said Wazzer. ‘It’s spreading Alarm and Despondency, isn’t it?’

‘Maybe we ought to be alarmed,’ said Maladict. ‘Do you know how he came
to be here? He travels around writing down things about the war for his
paper of news. He met these cavalry just up the road. In _our_ country!
And they told him they’d just heard that the very last recruits from
Borogravia were here and they were nothing but, er, “a wet little bunch
of squeaking boys”. They said they’d capture us for our own good and he
could get a picture of us for his paper. He could show everybody how
dreadful things were, they said, because we were scraping the bottom of
the barrel.’

‘Yeah, but we beat ’em so that’s foxed him!’ said Tonker, grinning
nastily. ‘Nothing for him to write down now, eh?’

‘Um . . . not really. He says that this is even better!’

‘Better? Whose side is _he_ on?’

‘Bit of a puzzler, really. He _comes_ from Ankh-Morpork, but he’s not
exactly on their side. Er . . . Otto Chriek, who makes the pictures for
him—’

‘The vampire? He crumbled to dust when the light flashed!’ said Polly.
‘Then he . . . came back!’

‘Well, I was standing behind Carborundum at the time,’ said Maladict,
‘but I know the technique. He probably had a thin glass vial of b . . .
bl . . . blur . . . no, wait, I can say this . . . _blood_.’ He sighed.
‘There! _No_ problem. A thin vial of . . . what I said . . . which
smashed on the ground and pulled the dust back together again. It’s a
great idea.’ Maladict gave them a wan smile. ‘I think he really cares a
lot about what he does, you know. Anyway, he told me de Worde just tries
to find out the truth. And then he writes it down and sells it to anyone
who wants it.’

‘And people _let_ him do that?’ said Polly.

‘Apparently. Otto says he makes Commander Vimes livid with rage about
once a week, but nothing ever happens.’

‘Vimes? The Butcher?’ said Polly.

‘He’s a duke, Otto says. But not like ours. Otto says he’s never seen
him butcher anybody. Otto’s a Black Ribboner, like me. He wouldn’t lie
to a fellow Ribboner. And he says that picture he took is going on the
clacks from the nearest tower tonight. It will be in the paper of news
tomorrow! _And_ they print a copy here!’

‘How can you send a picture on the clacks?’ said Polly. ‘I know people
who’ve seen them. It’s just a lot of boxes on a tower that go
clack-clack!’

‘Ah, Otto explained that to me, too,’ said Maladict. ‘It’s very
ingenious.’

‘How does it work, then?’

‘Oh, I didn’t _understand_ what he said. It was all about . . . numbers.
But it certainly sounded very clever. Anyway, de Worde just told the
lieu— the rupert that news about a bunch of boys beating up experienced
soldiers would certainly make people sit up and take notice!’

The squad looked at one another sheepishly.

‘It was a bit of a fluke, and anyway we had Carborundum,’ said Tonker.

‘And I used trickery,’ said Polly. ‘I mean, I couldn’t do it twice.’

‘So what?’ said Maladict. ‘We did it. The squad did it! Next time we’ll
do it differently!’

‘Yeah!’ said Tonker. And there was a shared moment of exhilaration in
which they were capable of anything. It lasted all of . . . a moment.

‘But it won’t work,’ said Shufti. ‘We’ve just been lucky. You know it
won’t work, Maladict. You _all_ know it won’t work, right?’

‘Well, I’m not saying we could, you know, take on a regiment all at
once,’ said Maladict. ‘And the lieu— rupert might be a bit wet. But we
could help make a difference. Old Jackrum knows what he’s doing—’

‘Upon my oath I am not a violent man . . . whack!’ sniggered Tonker, and
there were a few . . . yes, giggles, they _were_ giggles, Polly knew,
from the squad.

‘No, you’re not,’ said Shufti flatly. ‘None of us are, right? Because
we’re girls.’

There was a dead silence.

‘Well, not Carborundum and Ozzer, okay,’ Shufti went on, as if the
silence was sucking unwilling words out of her. ‘And I’m not sure about
Maladict and Igor. But I _know_ the rest of us are, right? I’ve got
eyes, I’ve got ears, I’ve got a _brain_. Right?’

In the silence there was the slow rumble that preceded a pronouncement
from Carborundum.

‘If it any help,’ she said, in a voice suddenly more sandy than
gravelly, ‘my real name’s Jade.’

Polly felt questing eyes boring into her. She was embarrassed, of
course. But not for the obvious reason. It was for the other one, the
little lesson that life sometimes rams home with a stick: you are not
the only one watching the world. Other people are people; while you
watch them they watch you, and they think about you while you think
about them. _The world isn’t just about you._

There was going to be no possibility of getting out of this. And, in a
way, it was a relief.

‘Polly,’ she said, almost in a whisper.

She looked questioningly at Maladict, who smiled in a distinctly
non-committal way. ‘Is this the time?’ he said.

‘_All right, you lot, what’re you standing about for?_’ bawled Jackrum,
six inches from the back of Maladict’s head. No one saw him arrive
there; he moved with an NCO’s stealth, which sometimes mystifies even
Igors.

Maladict’s smile didn’t change. ‘Why, we’re awaiting your orders,
sergeant,’ he said, turning round.

‘D’you think you’re clever, Maladict?’

‘Um . . . yes, sarge. Quite clever,’ the vampire conceded.

There wasn’t a lot of humour in Jackrum’s smile. ‘Good. Glad to hear it.
Don’t want another stupid corporal. Yeah, I know you ain’t even a proper
private yet, but glory be, you’re a corporal now, ’cos I need one and
you’re the snappiest dresser. Get some stripes from Threeparts. The rest
of you . . . this isn’t a bleedin’ mothers’ meeting, we’re leaving in
five minutes. Move!’

‘But the prisoners, sarge—’ Polly began, still trying to digest the
revelation.

‘We’re goin’ to drag ’em over to the inn an’ leave ’em tied up in the
nood, and shackled together,’ said Jackrum. ‘Vicious little devil when
he’s roused, our rupert, eh? And Threeparts is having their boots and
horses. They won’t be going too far for a while, not in the nood.’

‘Won’t the writing man let them out?’ said Tonker.

‘Don’t care,’ said Jackrum. ‘He could probably cut the ropes, but I’m
dropping the shackle key in the privy, and that’ll take a bit of fishing
out.’

‘Whose _side_ is he on, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Dunno. I don’t trust ’em. Ignore ’em. Don’t talk to ’em. Never talk to
people who writes things down. Milit’ry rule. Now, I know I just gave
you lot an order ’cos I heard the bleedin’ echo! Get on with it! We are
_leaving_!’

‘Road to perdition, lad, promotion,’ said Scallot to Maladict, swinging
up with two stripes hanging from his hook. He grinned. ‘That’s three
pence extra a day you’re due now, only you won’t get it ’cos they ain’t
payin’ us, but to look on the bright side, you won’t get stoppages, and
they’re a devil for stoppages. The way I see it, march backwards and yer
pockets’ll overflow!’

The rain had stopped. Most of the squad were parading outside the
barracks where there was, now, a small covered wagon belonging to the
writer of the paper of news. A large flag hung from a pole attached to
it, but Polly couldn’t make out the design by moonlight. Beside the
wagon, Maladict was deep in conversation with Otto.

The centre of attention, though, was the line of cavalry horses. One had
been offered to Blouse, but he’d waved it away with a look of alarm,
muttering something about ‘being loyal to his steed’, which to Polly’s
eye looked like a self-propelled toast-rack with a bad attitude. But
he’d probably made the right decision, at that, because they were big
beasts, broad, battle-hardened and bright-eyed; sitting astride one of
them would have strained the crotch in Blouse’s trousers and an attempt
at reining one of them in would have pulled his arms off at the
shoulder. Now each horse had a pair of boots hanging from its saddle,
except for the leading horse, a truly magnificent beast upon which
Corporal Scallot sat like an afterthought.

‘I’m no donkey-walloper as you know, Threeparts,’ said Jackrum, as he
finished lashing the crutches behind the saddle, ‘but this is a hell of
a good horse you’ve got here.’

‘Damn right, sarge. You could feed a platoon for a week off’f it!’ said
the corporal.

‘Sure you won’t come with us?’ Jackrum added, standing back. ‘I reckon
you still must’ve one or two things left for the bastards to cut off,
eh?’

‘Thank you, sarge, it’s a kind offer,’ said Threeparts. ‘But fast horses
are going to be at a real premium soon, and I’ll be in on the ground
floor, as you might say. This lot’ll be worth three years’ pay.’ He
turned in the saddle and nodded at the squad. ‘Best of luck, lads,’ he
added cheerfully. ‘You’ll walk with Death every day, but I’ve seen ’im
and he’s been known to wink. And remember: fill your boots with soup!’
He urged the horses into a walk, and disappeared with his trophies into
the gloom.

Jackrum watched him go, shook his head, and turned to the recruits. ‘All
right, ladies— What’s funny, Private Halter?’

‘Er, nothing, sarge, I just . . . thought of something . . .’ said
Tonker, almost choking.

‘You ain’t paid to think of things, you’re paid to march. Do it!’

The squad marched away. The rain slackened to nothing but the wind rose
a little, rattling windows, blowing through the deserted houses, opening
and shutting doors like someone looking for something they could have
sworn they put down here only a moment ago. That was all that moved in
Plotz, except for one candle flame, down near the floor in the back room
of the deserted barracks.

The candle had been tilted so that it leaned against a cotton thread
fastened between the legs of a stool. This meant that when the candle
burned low enough, it would burn through the thread and fall all the way
to the floor and into a ragged trail of straw that led to a pile of
palliasses on which had been stood two ancient cans of lamp oil.

It took about an hour in the wet, dejected night, for this to happen,
and then all the windows blew out.

* * *

Tomorrow dawned on Borogravia like a great big fish. A pigeon rose over
the forests, banked slightly, and headed straight for the valley of the
Kneck. Even from here, the black stone bulk of the keep was visible,
rising above the sea of trees. The pigeon sped on, one spark of purpose
in the fresh new morning—

—and squawked as darkness dropped from the sky, gripping it in talons of
steel. Buzzard and pigeon tumbled for a moment, and then the buzzard
gained a little height and flapped onwards.

The pigeon thought: 000000000! But had it been more capable of coherent
thought, and known something about how birds of prey catch pigeons², it
might have wondered why it was being gripped so . . . kindly. It was
being held, not squeezed. As it was, all it could think was: 000000000!

The buzzard reached the valley and began to circle low over the keep. As
it gyred, a tiny figure detached itself from the leather harness on its
back and, with great care, inched itself around the body and down to the
talons. It reached the imprisoned pigeon, knelt on it and put its arms
round the bird’s neck. The buzzard skimmed low over a stone balcony,
reared in the air, and let the pigeon go. Bird and tiny man rolled and
bounced across the flagstones in a trail of feathers, and lay still.

Eventually a voice from somewhere under the pigeon said: ‘Bugger . . .’

Urgent footsteps ran across the stones and the pigeon was lifted off
Corporal Buggy Swires. He was a gnome, and barely six inches tall. On
the other hand, as the head and only member of Ankh-Morpork City Watch’s
Airborne Section, he spent most of his time so high that _everyone_
looked small.

‘Are you all right, Buggy?’ said Commander Vimes.

‘Not too bad, sir,’ said Buggy, spitting out a feather. ‘But it wasn’t
elegant, was it? I’ll do better next time. Trouble is, pigeons are too
stupid to be steered—’

‘What’ve you got me?’

‘The _Times_ sent this up from their cart, sir! I tracked it all the
way!’

‘Well _done_, Buggy!’

There was a flurry of wings and the buzzard landed on the battlements.

‘And, er— what is his name?’ Vimes added. The buzzard gave him the mad,
distant look of all birds.

‘She’s Morag, sir. Trained by the pictsies. Wonderful bird.’

‘Was she the one we paid a crate of whisky for?’

‘Yes, sir, and worth every dram.’

The pigeon struggled in Vimes’s hand.

‘You wait there, then, Buggy, and I’ll get Reg to come out with some raw
rabbit,’ he said, and walked into his tower.

Sergeant Angua was waiting by his desk, reading the _Living Testament of
Nuggan_. ‘Is that a carrier pigeon, sir?’ she said, as Vimes sat down.

‘No,’ said Vimes. ‘Hold it a minute, will you? I want to have a look
inside the message capsule.’

‘It does _look_ like a carrier pigeon,’ said Angua, putting down the
book.

‘Ah, but messages flying through the air are an Abomination unto
Nuggan,’ said Vimes. ‘The prayers of the faithful bounce off them,
apparently. No, I think I’ve found someone’s lost pet and I’m looking in
this little tube here to see if I can find the owner’s name and address,
because I am a kind man.’

‘So you’re not actually waylaying field reports from the _Times_, then,
sir?’ said Angua, grinning.

‘Not as such, no. I’m just such a keen reader that I want to see
tomorrow’s news today. And Mr de Worde seems to have a knack of finding
things out. Angua, I want to stop these stupid people fighting so that
we can all go home, and if that means allowing the occasional pigeon to
have a crap on my desk, so be it.’

‘Oh, sorry, sir, I didn’t notice. I expect it’ll wipe off.’

‘Go and get Reg to find some rabbit for the buzzard, will you?’

When she’d gone Vimes carefully unscrewed the end of the tube and pulled
out a roll of very thin paper. He unfolded it, smoothed it out, and read
the tiny writing, smiling as he did so. Then he turned the paper over
and looked at the picture.

He was still staring at it when Angua returned with Reg and half a
bucket of crunchy rabbit bits.

‘Anything interesting, sir?’ said Angua ingenuously.

‘Well, yes. You could say that. All plans are changed, all bets are off.
Ha! Oh, Mr de Worde, you poor fool . . .’

He handed her the paper. She read the story carefully.

‘Good for them, sir,’ she said. ‘Most of them look fifteen years old,
and when you see the size of those dragoons, well, you’ve got to be
impressed.’

‘Yes, yes, you could say that, you could say that,’ said Vimes, his face
gleaming like a man with a joke to share. ‘Tell me, did de Worde
interview any Zlobenian high-ups when he arrived?’

‘No, sir. I understand he was turned away. They don’t really know what a
reporter is, so I gather the adjutant threw him out and said he was a
nuisance.’

‘Dear me, the poor man,’ said Vimes, still grinning. ‘You met Prince
Heinrich the other day. Describe him to me . . .’

Angua cleared her throat. ‘Well, sir, he was . . . largely green,
shading to blue, with overtones of _grllss_ and trail of—’

‘I meant describe him to me on the assumption that I’m not a werewolf
who sees with his nose,’ said Vimes.

‘Oh, yes,’ said Angua. ‘Sorry, sir. Six foot two, a hundred and eighty
pounds, fair hair, green-blue eyes, sabre scar on his left cheek, wears
a monocle in his right eye, waxed moustache—’

‘Good, well observed. And now look at “Captain Horentz” in the picture,
will you?’

She looked again, and said, very quietly: ‘Oh dear. They didn’t know?’

‘He wasn’t going to tell them, was he? Would they have seen a picture?’

Angua shrugged. ‘I doubt it, sir. I mean, where would they see it?
There’s never been a newspaper here until the _Times_ carts turned up
last week.’

‘Some woodcut, maybe?’

‘No, they’re an Abomination, unless they’re of the Duchess.’

‘So they really didn’t know. And de Worde has never seen him,’ said
Vimes. ‘But you saw him when we arrived the other day. What did you
think of him? Just between ourselves.’

‘An arrogant son-of-a-bitch, sir, and I know what I’m talking about. The
kind of man who thinks he knows what a woman likes and it’s himself. All
very friendly right up until they say no.’

‘Stupid?’

‘I don’t think so. But not as clever as he thinks he is.’

‘Right, ’cos he didn’t tell our writer friend his real name. Did you
read the bit at the end?’

Angua read, at the end of the text: ‘Perry, the captain, threatened and
harangued me after the recruits had gone. Alas, I had no time to fish
for the manacle key in the privy. Please let the Prince know where they
are soonest. WDW’

‘Looks like William didn’t take to him, either,’ she said. ‘I wonder why
the Prince was out with a scouting party?’

‘You said he was an arrogant son-of-a-bitch,’ said Vimes. ‘Maybe he just
wanted to pop across and see if his auntie was still breathing . . .’

His voice trailed off. Angua looked at Vimes’s face, which was staring
through her. She knew her boss. He thought war was simply another crime,
like murder. He didn’t much like people with titles, and regarded being
a duke as a job description rather than a lever to greatness. He had an
odd sense of humour. And he had a sense for what she thought of as
harbingers, those little straws in the wind that said there was a storm
coming.

‘In the nuddy,’ he chuckled. ‘Could have slit their throats. Didn’t.
They took their boots away and left them to hop home in the nood.’ The
squad, it seemed, had found a friend.

She waited.

‘I feel sorry for the Borogravians,’ he said.

‘Me too, sir,’ said Angua.

‘Oh? Why?’

‘Their religion’s gone bad on them. Have you seen the latest
Abominations? They Abominate the smell of beets and people with red
hair. In rather shaky writing, sir. And root vegetables are a staple
here. Three years ago it was Abominable to grow root crops on ground
which had grown grain or peas.’

Vimes looked blank, and she remembered that he was a city boy.

‘It means no real crop rotation, sir,’ she explained. ‘The ground sours.
Diseases build up. You were right when you said they were going mad.
These . . . commandments are _dumb_, and any farmer can see that. I
imagine people go along with them as best they can, but sooner or later
you either have to break them and feel guilty, or keep them and suffer.
For no reason, sir. I’ve had a look around. They’re very religious here,
but their god’s let them down. No wonder they mostly pray to their royal
family.’

She watched him stare at the piece of pigeon post for a while. Then he
said: ‘How far is it to Plotz?’

‘About fifty miles,’ said Angua, adding, ‘As the wolf runs, maybe six
hours.’

‘Good. Buggy’ll keep an eye on you. Little Henry is going to hop home,
or meet one of his patrols, or an enemy patrol . . . whatever. But the
midden is going to hit the windmill when everyone sees that picture. I
bet de Worde would have let him out if he’d been nice and polite.
_That’ll_ teach him to meddle with the awesome power of a fair and free
press, haha.’ He sat upright and rubbed his hands together like a man
who meant business. ‘Now, let’s get that pigeon on its way again before
it gets missed, eh? Get Reg to lurch along to where the _Times_ people
are staying and tell them their pigeon flew in the wrong window. Again.’

That was a good time, Polly remembered.

They didn’t go down to the river docks. They could see there was no boat
there. They hadn’t turned up and the boatman had left without them.
Instead, they crossed the bridge and headed up into the forests, with
Blouse leading the way on his ancient horse. Maladict went on ahead and
. . . Jade brought up the rear. You didn’t need a light at night when a
vampire led the way, and a troll at the rear would certainly discourage
hangers-on.

No one mentioned the boat. No one spoke at all. The thing was . . . the
thing _was_, Polly realized, that they were no longer marching alone.
They shared the Secret. That was a huge relief, and right now they
didn’t need to talk about it. Nevertheless, it was probably a good idea
to keep up a regular output of farts, belches, nose-pickings and
groin-scratchings, just in case.

Polly didn’t know whether to be proud that they’d taken her for a boy. I
mean, she thought, I’d worked hard to get it right, I mastered the walk,
except I suppose what I really did was mistress the walk, haha, I
invented the fake shaving routine and the others didn’t even think of
that, I haven’t cleaned my fingernails for days and I pride myself I can
belch with the best of them. So, I mean, I _was_ trying. It was just
slightly annoying to find that she’d succeeded so well.

After a few hours of this, when true dawn was breaking, they smelled
smoke. There was a faint pall of it amongst the trees. Lieutenant Blouse
raised a hand for them to halt, and Jackrum joined him in whispered
conversation.

Polly stepped forward. ‘Permission to whisper too, sarge? I think I know
what this is.’

Jackrum and Blouse stared at her. Then the sergeant said: ‘All right,
Perks. Go and find out if you’re right, then.’

That was an aspect that hadn’t occurred to Polly, but she’d left herself
open. Jackrum relented when he saw her expression, nodded to Maladict,
and said, ‘Go with him, corporal.’

They left the squad behind and walked forward carefully, over the beds
of new-fallen leaves. The smoke was heavy and fragrant and, above all,
reminiscent. Polly headed to where thicker undergrowth was taking
advantage of the extra light of a clearing, and pushed through into an
airy thicket of hazel trees. The smoke was denser here, and barely
moving.

The thicket ended. A few yards away, in a wide patch of cleared ground,
a mound like a small volcano was spewing flame and smoke into the air.

‘Charcoal oven,’ whispered Polly. ‘Just clay plastered on a stack of
hazel. Should sit there smouldering for days. The wind probably caught
it last night and the fire’s broken out. Won’t make good charcoal now,
it’s burning too fast.’

They edged round it, keeping to the bushes. Other clay domes were dotted
about the clearing, with faint wisps of steam and smoke coming from
their tops. There were a couple of ovens in the process of being built,
the fresh clay stacked alongside some bundles of hazel sticks. There was
a hut, and the domes, and nothing else but silence, apart from the
crackle of the runaway fire.

‘The charcoal-burner is dead, or nearly dead,’ said Polly.

‘He’s dead,’ said Maladict. ‘There’s a smell of death here.’

‘You can smell it above the smoke?’

‘Sure,’ said Maladict. ‘Some things we’re good at smelling. But how did
_you_ know?’

‘They watch the burns like hawks,’ said Polly, staring at the hut. ‘He
wouldn’t let it go out of control like that if he was alive. Is he in
the hut?’

‘_They_ are in the hut,’ said Maladict flatly. He set off across the
smoky ground.

Polly ran after him. ‘Man and woman?’ she said. ‘Their wives often live
out with—’

‘Can’t tell, not if they’re old.’

The hut was only a temporary thing, made of woven hazel and roofed with
tarpaulin; the charcoal-burners moved around a lot, from coppice to
coppice. It didn’t have windows, but it did have a doorway, with a rag
for a door. The rag had been pulled away; the doorway was dark.

I’ve got to be a man about this, Polly thought.

There was a woman on the bed, and a man lying on the floor. There were
other details, which the eye saw but the brain did not focus on. There
was a great deal of blood. The couple had been old. They would not grow
older.

Back outside, Polly took frantic mouthfuls of air. ‘Do you think those
cavalrymen did it?’ she said at last, and then realized that Maladict
was shaking. ‘Oh . . . the blood . . .’ she said.

‘I can deal with it! It’s okay! I just have to get my mind right, it’s
okay!’ He leaned against the hut, breathing heavily. ‘Okay, I’m fine,’
he said. ‘And I can’t smell horses. Why don’t you use your eyes? Nice
soft mud everywhere after the rain, but no hoofprints. Plenty of
footprints, though. We did it.’

‘Don’t be silly, we were—’

The vampire had reached down and pulled something out of the fallen
leaves. He rubbed the mud off it with a thumb. In thin pressed brass, it
was the Flaming Cheese badge of the Ins-and-Outs.

‘But . . . I thought we were the good guys,’ said Polly weakly. ‘If we
were guys, I mean.’

‘I think I need a coffee,’ said the vampire.

‘Deserters,’ said Sergeant Jackrum, ten minutes later. ‘It happens.’ He
tossed the badge into the fire.

‘But they were on _our_ side!’ said Shufti.

‘So? Not everyone’s a nice gennelman like you, Private Manickle,’ said
Jackrum. ‘Not after a few years of gettin’ shot at and eatin’ rat
scubbo. On the retreat from Khrusk I had no water for three days and
then fell on my face in a puddle of horse piss, a circumstance which did
nothing for my feelin’s of goodwill towards my fellow man or horse.
Something the matter, corporal?’

Maladict was on his knees, going through his pack with a distracted air.
‘My coffee’s gone, sarge.’

‘Can’t have packed it properly, then,’ said Jackrum unsympathetically.

‘I _did_, sarge! I washed out the engine and packed it up with the bean
bag after supper last night. I _know_ I did. I don’t take coffee
lightly!’

‘If someone else did, they’re going to wish I’d never been born,’
growled Jackrum, looking round at the rest of the squad. ‘Anyone else
lost anything?’

‘Er . . . I wasn’t going to say anything, ’cos I wasn’t sure,’ Shufti
volunteered, ‘but my stuff looked as if it had been pulled about when I
opened my pack just now . . .’

‘Oh-ho!’ said Jackrum. ‘Well, well, _well_! I’ll say this once, lads.
Pinching from yer mates is a hanging offence, understood? Nothing breaks
down morale faster’n some sneaky little sod dipping into people’s packs.
And if I find out someone’s been at it, I’ll swing on their heels!’ He
glared at the squad. ‘I ain’t gonna demand that you all empty out your
packs as if you’s criminals,’ he said, ‘but you’d better check that
nothing’s missing. O’ course, one of you might have packed something
that wasn’t theirs by _accident_, okay. Packing in a rush, poor light,
easy to do. In which case, you sort it out amongst yourselves,
understand? Now, I’m off to have a shave. Lieutenant Blouse is having a
throw-up behind the shelter after a-viewin’ of the corpses, poor chap.’

Polly rummaged desperately in her pack. She’d thrown things in any old
how last night, but what she was frantically searching for was—

—not there. Despite the heat from the charcoal mounds, she shivered.

The ringlets had gone. Feverishly, she tried to remember the events of
yesterday evening. They’d just dumped their packs as soon as they were
in the barracks, right? And Maladict _had_ made himself some coffee at
suppertime. _He’d washed and dried the little machine_—

There was a thin little wail. Wazzer, the meagre contents of her pack
spread around her, held up the coffee engine. It had been stamped almost
flat.

‘B-b-b—’ she began.

Polly’s mind worked faster, like a millwheel in a flood. Then everyone
took their packs into the back room with all the mattresses, didn’t
they? So they’d still be there when the squad fought the troopers—

‘Oh, Wazz,’ said Shufti. ‘Oh, dear . . .’

So who might have sneaked in through the back door? There was no one
around except the squad and the cavalrymen. _Perhaps someone wanted to
watch, and cause a little trouble on the way_—

‘Strappi!’ she said aloud. ‘It must have been him! The little weasel ran
into the cavalry and then snuck back to watch! He was dar— damn well
going through our packs out the back! Oh, come on,’ she added, as they
stared at her, ‘can you see Wazzer stealing from anyone? Anyway, when
did she have the chance?’

‘Wouldn’t they have taken him prisoner?’ said Tonker, staring at the
crushed machine in Wazzer’s shaking hands.

‘If he’d whipped off his shako and jacket he’d just be another stupid
civilian, wouldn’t he? Or he could just say he was a deserter. He could
make up some story,’ said Polly. ‘You know how he was with Wazzer. He
went through my pack, too. Stole . . . something of mine.’

‘What was it?’ said Shufti.

‘Just something, okay? He just wanted to . . . make trouble.’ She
watched them thinking.

‘Sounds convincing,’ said Maladict, nodding abruptly. ‘Little weasel.
Okay, Wazz, just fish out the beans and I’ll do the best I can—’

‘T-there’s no b-b-b—’

Maladict put a hand over his eyes. ‘No beans?’ he said. ‘Please, has
_anyone_ got the beans?’

There was a general rummaging, and a general lack of a result.

‘No beans,’ moaned Maladict. ‘He threw away the beans . . .’

‘Come on, lads, we’ve got to get sentries posted,’ said Jackrum,
approaching. ‘Sorted it all out, have you?’

‘Yes, sarge. Ozz thinks—’ Shufti began.

‘It was all a bit of mis-packing, sarge!’ said Polly quickly, anxious to
keep away from anything connected with missing ringlets. ‘Nothing to
worry about! All sorted, sarge. No problem. Nothing to worry anyone. Not
. . . a . . . thing, sarge.’

Jackrum looked from the startled squad to Polly, and back, and back
again. She felt his gaze boring into her, daring her to change her
expression of mad, tense honesty.

‘Ye-es,’ he said slowly. ‘Right. Sorted out, eh? Well done, Perks.
Attention! Officer present!’

‘Yes, yes, sergeant, thank you, but I don’t think we need to be too
formal,’ said Blouse, who looked rather pale. ‘A word with you when you
have finished, if you please? And I think we should bury the, er,
bodies.’

Jackrum saluted. ‘Right you are, sir. Two volunteers to dig a grave for
those poor souls! Goom and Tewt— what’s he doing?’

Lofty was over by the blazing charcoal oven. She was holding a burning
branch a foot or two from her face and turning it this way and that,
watching the flames.

‘I’ll do it, sarge,’ said Tonker, stepping beside Wazzer.

‘What are you, married?’ said Jackrum. ‘_You_ are on guard, Halter. I
doubt whoever did it’ll come back, but if they do, you sing out, right?
You and Igor come with me, and I’ll show you your stations.’

‘No coffee,’ moaned Maladict.

‘Foul muck, anyway,’ said Jackrum, walking away. ‘A cup of hot sweet tea
is the soldier’s friend.’

Polly grabbed the kettle for Blouse’s shaving water, and hurried away.
That was another thing you learned in the milit’ry: look busy. Look busy
and no one worried too much about what you were busy at.

Bloody, bloody Strappi! He’d got her _hair_! He’d try to use it against
her if he could, that was certain. That’d be his style. What would he do
now? Well, he’d want to keep away from Jackrum, that’d be another
certainty. He’d wait, somewhere. She’d have to, too.

The squad had made camp upwind of the smoke. It was supposed to be a
rest stop, since no one had got much sleep last night, but as Jackrum
handed out tasks he reminded them: ‘There is an old milit’ry saying,
which is: Hard Luck For You.’

There was no question of using the woven hut, but there were a few
tarpaulin-covered frames built to keep the coppiced wood dry. Those not
given jobs to do lay down on the stacked piles of twigs, which were
yielding and didn’t smell and were in any case better than the inhabited
palliasses back at the barracks.

Blouse, as an officer, had a shelter to himself. Polly had stacked
bundles of twigs to make a chair that was at least springy. Now she laid
out his shaving things and turned to go—

‘Could _you_ shave me, Perks?’ said the lieutenant.

Fortunately, Polly’s back was turned and he didn’t see her expression.

‘This damn hand is quite swollen, I’m afraid,’ Blouse went on. ‘I would
not normally ask, but—’

‘Yes, of course, sir,’ said Polly, because there was no alternative.
Well now, let’s see . . . she’d got quite good at scraping a blunt razor
across a face bare of hair, yes. Oh, and she’d shaved a few dead pigs in
the kitchens at The Duchess, but that was only because nobody likes
hairy bacon. They didn’t really count, did they? Panic rose, and rose
faster at the sight of Jackrum approaching. She was going to cut an
officer’s throat in the presence of a sergeant.

Well, when in doubt, bustle. Milit’ry rule. Bustle, and hope there’s a
surprise attack.

‘Are you not being a little strict with the men, sergeant?’ said Blouse,
as Polly flapped a towel round his neck.

‘No, sir. Keep ’em occupied, that’s the bunny. Otherwise they’ll mope,’
said Jackrum confidently.

‘Yes, but they _have_ just seen a couple of badly mutilated bodies,’
said Blouse, and shuddered.

‘Good practice for ’em, sir. They’ll see plenty more.’

Polly turned to the shaving gear she’d laid out on another towel. Let’s
see . . . cut-throat razor, oh dear, the grey stone for coarse
sharpening, the red stone for fine sharpening, the soap, the brush, the
bowl . . . well, at least she knew how to make foam . . .

‘Deserters, sergeant. Bad business,’ Blouse went on.

‘You always get ’em, sir. That’s why the pay is always late. Walking
away from three months’ back pay makes a man think twice.’

‘Mr de Worde the newspaper man said there had been a great many
desertions, sergeant. It is very strange that so many men would desert
from a winning side.’

Polly whirled the brush vigorously. Jackrum, for the first time since
Maladict had joined, looked uncomfortable.

‘But whose side is he on, sir?’ he said.

‘Sergeant, I am sure you are not a stupid man,’ said Blouse, as, behind
him, foam poured over the edge of the bowl and flopped on to the floor.
‘There are desperate deserters abroad. Our borders appear to be
sufficiently unguarded to enable enemy cavalry to operate forty miles
inside “our fair country”. And High Command appears to be so desperate,
yes, _desperate_, sergeant, that even half a dozen untrained and,
frankly, very young men must go to the front.’

The foam had a life of its own now. Polly hesitated.

‘Hot towel first, please, Perks,’ said Blouse.

‘Yessir. Sorry, sir. Forgot, sir,’ said Polly, panic rising. She had a
vague recollection of walking past the barber shop in Munz. Hot towel on
face. Right. She grabbed a small towel, tipped boiling water on to it,
wrung it out and placed it on the lieutenant’s face. He did not actually
scream, as such.

‘_Aaaaagh_ something else worries me, sergeant.’

‘Yessir?’

‘The cavalry must have apprehended Corporal Strappi. I cannot see how
else they found out about our men.’

‘Good thinking, sir,’ said the sergeant, watching Polly apply the lather
across mouth and nose.

‘I do hope they didn’t _pff_ torture the poor man,’ said the lieutenant.
Jackrum was silent on that issue, but meaningfully so. Polly wished he
wouldn’t keep glancing at her.

‘But why would a deserter _pff_ head straight for the _pff_ front?’ said
Blouse.

‘Makes sense, sir, for an old soldier. Especially a political.’

‘Really?’

‘Trust me on that, sir,’ said Jackrum. Behind Blouse, Polly brushed the
razor up and down the red stone. It was already as slick as ice.

‘But our boys, sergeant, are not “old soldiers”. It takes _pff_ two
weeks to turn a recruit into a “fighting man”,’ said the lieutenant.

‘They’re promising material, sir. I could do it in a couple of days,
sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘_Perks?_’

Polly nearly sliced her thumb off. ‘Yes, sarge,’ she quavered.

‘Do you think you could kill a man today?’

Polly glanced at the razor. The edge glowed. ‘I’m sorry to say I think I
could, sir!’

‘There you have it, sir,’ said Jackrum, with a lopsided grin. ‘There’s
something about these lads, sir. They’re quick.’ He walked behind
Blouse, took the razor from Polly’s grateful hand without a word, and
said: ‘There’s a few matters we ought to discuss, sir, private like. I
think Perks here ought to get some rest.’

‘Of course, sergeant. _Pas devant les soldats jeunes_, eh?’

‘And them too, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘You’re dismissed, Perks.’

Polly walked away, her right hand still trembling. Behind her, she heard
Blouse sigh and say: ‘These are tricky times, sergeant. Command has
never been so burdensome. The great General Tacticus says that in
dangerous times the commander must be like the eagle and see the whole,
and yet still be like the hawk and see every detail.’

‘Yessir,’ said Jackrum, gliding the razor down a cheek. ‘And if he acts
like a common tit, sir, he can hang upside down all day and eat fat
bacon.’

‘Er . . . well said, sergeant.’

The charcoal-burner and his wife were buried to the accompaniment of, to
Polly’s lack of surprise, a small prayer from Wazzer. It asked the
Duchess to intercede with the god Nuggan to give eternal rest and
similar items to the departed. Polly had heard it many times before;
she’d wondered how the process worked.

She’d never prayed since the day the bird burned, not even when her
mother was dying. A god that burned painted birds would not save a
mother. A god like that was not worth a prayer.

But Wazzer prayed for everyone. Wazzer prayed like a child, eyes screwed
up and hands clenched until they were white. The reedy little voice
trembled with such belief that Polly felt embarrassed, and then ashamed
and, finally, after the ringing ‘amen’, amazed that the world appeared
no different from before. For a minute or two, it had been a better
place . . .

There was a cat in the hut. It cowered under the crude bed and spat at
anyone who came close.

‘All the food’s been taken but there’s carrots and parsnips in a little
garden down the hill a bit,’ Shufti said, as they walked away.

‘It’d be s-stealing from the dead,’ said Wazzer.

‘Well, if they object they can hold on, can’t they?’ said Shufti.
‘They’re underground already!’

For some reason that was, at this time, funny. They’d have laughed at
anything.

Now there was Jade, Lofty, Shufti and Polly. Everyone else was on guard
duty. They sat by the fire, on which a small pot seethed. Lofty tended
the fire. She always seemed more animated near a fire, Polly noticed.

‘I’m doing horse scubbo for the rupert,’ said Shufti, easily dropping
into a slang learned all of twenty hours ago. ‘He specifically asked for
it. Got lots of dry horse jerky from Threeparts, but Tonker says she can
knock over some pheasants while she’s on duty.’

‘I hope she spends some time watching for enemies too,’ said Polly.

‘She’ll be careful,’ said Lofty, prodding the fire with a stick.

‘You know, if we’re found out, we’ll be beaten and sent back,’ said
Shufti.

‘Who by?’ said Polly, so suddenly she surprised herself. ‘By whom? Who’s
going to try, out here? Who _cares_ out here?’

‘Well, er, wearing men’s clothes _is_ an Abomination unto Nuggan—’

‘Why?’

‘It just is,’ said Shufti firmly. ‘But—’

‘—you’re wearing them,’ said Polly.

‘Well, it was the only way,’ said Shufti. ‘And I tried them on and they
didn’t seem all that abominable to me.’

‘Have you noticed men talk to you differently?’ said Lofty shyly.

‘Talk?’ said Polly. ‘They _listen_ to you differently, too.’

‘They don’t keep looking at you all the time,’ said Shufti. ‘You know
what I mean. You’re just a . . . another person. If a girl walked down
the street wearing a sword a man would try to take it off her.’

‘Wi’ trolls, we ain’t allowed to carry clubs,’ said Jade. ‘Only large
rocks. An’ it ain’t right for a girl to wear lichen, ’cos der boys say
bald is modest. Had to rub bird doin’s inna my head to grow this lot.’

That was quite a long speech for a troll.

‘We didn’t know that,’ said Polly. ‘Er . . . trolls all look the same to
us, more or less.’

‘I’m nat’rally craggy,’ said Jade. ‘I don’t see why I should polish.’

‘There _is_ a difference,’ said Shufti. ‘I think it’s the socks. It’s
like they pull you forward all the time. It’s like the whole world spins
around your socks.’ She sighed and looked at the horsemeat, which had
been boiled almost white. ‘It’s done,’ she said. ‘You’d better go and
give it to the rupert, Polly . . . I mean, Ozzer. I told the sarge I
could do something better but he said the lieutenant said how good it
was last night—’

A small wild turkey, a brace of pheasants and a couple of rabbits, all
tied together, landed in front of Shufti.

‘Good job we were guarding you, eh?’ said Tonker, grinning and whirring
an empty sling around in one hand. ‘One rock, one lunch. Maladict’s
staying on guard. He said he’ll smell anyone before they see him and
he’s too edgy to eat. What can you do with that lot?’

‘Casserole of game,’ said Shufti firmly. ‘We’ve got the veg and I’ve
still got half an onion.³ I’m sure I can make an oven out of one of
those—’

‘On your feet! Attention!’ snapped the silently moving Jackrum, behind
them. He stood back with a faint smile on his face as they scrambled to
their feet. ‘Private Halter, I must have bleedin’ amazin’ eyesight,’ he
said, when they were approximately upright.

‘Yes, sarge,’ said Tonker, staring straight ahead.

‘Can you guess why, Private Halter?’

‘No, sarge.’

‘It’s because I knows you are on perimeter guard, Halter, but I can see
you as clear as if you was standing right here in front of me, Halter!
Can’t I, Halter?’

‘Yes, sarge!’

‘It’s just as well you _are_ still on perimeter duty, Halter, because
the penalty for absenting yourself from your post in time of war is
_death_, Halter!’

‘I only—’

‘No onlys! I don’t want to hear no onlys! I don’t want you to think that
I am a shouty man, Halter! Corporal Strappi was a shouty man, but he was
a damn political! Upon my oath I am not a shouty man _but if you ain’t
back at your post inside of thirty seconds I’ll rip yer tongue out!_’

Tonker fled. Sergeant Jackrum cleared his throat and continued, in a
level voice: ‘This, my lads, is what we call a _real_ orientation
lectchoor, not one of the fancy political ones like Strappi gave yer.’
He cleared his throat. ‘The purpose of this lectchoor is to let you know
where we are. We are in the deep cack. It couldn’t be worse if it was
raining arseholes. Any questions?’

Since there were none from the bemused recruits, he continued, while
beginning a slow stroll around the squad, ‘We know enemy forces are in
the area. Currently they have no boots. But there will be others with
boots aplenty. Also, there may be deserters in the area. They will not
be nice people! They will be impolite! Therefore Lieutenant Blouse has
decreed that we will travel off the roads and by night. Yes, we have met
the enemy, and we have prevailed. That was a fluke. They weren’t
expecting you to be rough, tough soldiers. Nor were you, so I don’t want
you to feel cocky about it.’ He leaned forward until his face was inches
from Polly’s. ‘Are you feeling cocky, Private Perks?’

‘No, sarge!’

‘Good. Good.’ Jackrum stepped back. ‘We are heading for the front, lads.
The war. And in a nasty war, where’s the best place to be? Apart from on
the moon, o’ course? No one?’

Slowly, Jade raised a hand.

‘Go on, then,’ said the sergeant.

‘In the army, sarge,’ said the troll. ‘’cos. . .’ She began to count on
her fingers. ‘One, you got weapons an’ armour an’ dat. Two, you are
surrounded by other armed men. Er . . . Many, youse gettin’ paid and
gettin’ better grub than the people in Civilian Street. Er . . . Lots,
if’n you gives up, you getting taken pris’ner and dere’s rules about
that like Not Kicking Pris’ners Inna Head and stuff, ’cos if you kick
their pris’ners inna head they’ll kick your pris’ners inna head so dat’
s, like, you’re kickin’ your own head, but dere’s no rule say you can’t
kick enemy civilians inna head. There’s other stuff too, but I ran outa
numbers.’ She gave them a diamond grin. ‘We may be slow but we ain’t
stoopid,’ she added.

‘I am impressed, private,’ said Jackrum. ‘And you are _right_. The only
wasp in the jam is that you ain’t soldiers! But I can help you there.
Bein’ a soldier is not hard. If it was, soldiers would not be able to do
it. There is only three things you need to remember, which are, viz: one
obey orders two give it to the enemy good and hard three don’t die. Got
that? Right! You’re nearly there! Well done! I propose to assist you in
the execution of all three! You are my little lads and I will look after
you! In the meantime, you got duties! Shufti, get cooking! Private
Perks, see to the rupert! And after that, practise your shaving! I will
now visit those on guard and deliver unto them the holy word!
Dismissed!’

They remained at something like attention until he was probably out of
earshot, and then sagged.

‘Why does he always _shout_?’ said Shufti. ’I mean, he only has to ask
. . .’

Polly upended the horrible scubbo into a tin bowl, and almost ran to the
lieutenant’s shelter. He looked up from a map and smiled at her as if
she was delivering a feast.

‘Ah, scubbo,’ he said.

‘We are actually having other stuff, sir,’ Polly volunteered. ‘I’m sure
there’s enough to go round—’

‘Good heavens, no, it’s been years since I’ve had food like this,’ said
Blouse, picking up the spoon. ‘Of course, at school we didn’t appreciate
it so much.’

‘You had food like this at school, sir?’ said Polly.

‘Yes. Most days,’ said Blouse happily.

Polly couldn’t quite fit this in her head. Blouse was a nob. Nobs ate
nobby food, didn’t they? ‘Had you done something _bad_, sir?’

‘I can’t imagine what you mean, Perks,’ said Blouse, slurping at the
horrible thin gruel. ‘Are the men rested?’

‘Yes, sir. The dead people were a bit of a shock—’

‘Yes. Bad business,’ sighed the lieutenant. ‘Such is war, alas. I am
only sorry you had to learn so fast. Such a terrible waste all the time.
I am sure things can be sorted out when we reach Kneck, though. No
general can expect young men like yourselves to be instant soldiers. I
shall have something to say about that.’ His rabbity features looked
unusually determined, as if a hamster had spotted a gap in its
treadmill.

‘Do you require me for anything else, sir?’ said Polly.

‘Er . . . do the men talk about me, Perks?’

‘Not really, sir, no.’

The lieutenant looked disappointed. ‘Oh. Oh, well. Thank you, Perks.’

* * *

Polly wondered if Jackrum ever slept. She did a spell of guard duty, and
he stepped out from behind her with ‘Guess who, Perks! You’re on
lookout. You should see the dreadful enemy before they see you. What’re
the four Ss?’

‘Shape, shadow, silhouette and shine, sarge!’ said Polly, snapping to
attention. She’d been expecting this.

That caused a moment’s pause from the sergeant before he said: ‘Just
_knew_ that, did yer?’

‘Nosir! A little bird told me when we changed guard, sir! Said you’d
asked him, sir!’

‘Oh, so Jackrum’s little lads are gangin’ up on their kindly ol’
sergeant, are they?’ said Jackrum.

‘Nosir. Sharing information important to the squad in a vital survival
situation, sarge!’

‘You’ve got a quick mouth on you, Perks, I’ll grant you that.’

‘Thank you, sarge!’

‘But I see you’re not standing in a bleedin’ shadow, Perks, nor have you
done anything to change your bleedin’ shape, you’re silhouetted against
the bleedin’ light and your sabre’s shining like a diamond in a
chimney-sweep’s bleedin’ ear’ole! Explain!’

‘It’s because of the one C, sarge!’ said Polly, still staring straight
ahead.

‘And that is?’

‘Colour, sarge! I’m wearing bleedin’ red and white in a bleedin’ grey
forest, sarge!’

She risked a sideways glance. In Jackrum’s little piggy eyes there
gleamed a gleam. It was the one you got when he was secretly pleased.

‘Ashamed of your lovely, lovely uniform, Perks?’ he said.

‘Don’t want to be seen dead in it, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘Hah. As you were, Perks.’

Polly smiled, straight ahead.

When she came off guard for a bowl of game casserole, Jackrum was
teaching basic swordcraft to Lofty and Tonker, using hazel sticks as
swords. By the time Polly had finished he was teaching Wazzer some of
the finer points of using a high-performance pistol crossbow, especially
the one about not turning round with it cocked and saying ‘W-what is
this bit for, sarge?’ Wazzer handled weapons like a houseproud woman
disposing of a dead mouse – at arm’s length and trying not to look. But
even she was better with them than Igor, who just didn’t seem at home
with the idea of what was, to him, randomized surgery.

Jade was dozing. Maladict was hanging by his knees under the roof of one
of the sheds, with his arms folded across his chest; he must have been
telling the truth when he said there were some aspects of being a
vampire that were hard to give up.

Igor and Maladict . . .

She still wasn’t sure about Maladict, but Igor had to be a boy, with
those stitches around the head, and that face that could only be called
homely.⁴ He was quiet, and neat, but maybe that’s how Igors behaved
. . .

She woke up with Shufti shaking her.

‘We’re moving! Better go and see to the rupert!’

‘What? Huh? Oh . . . right!’

There was a bustle all around her. Polly staggered to her feet and
hurried over to Lieutenant Blouse’s shed, where he was standing in front
of his wretched horse and holding the bridle with a lost expression.

‘Ah, Perks,’ he said. ‘I’m not at all sure I’m doing this right . . .’

‘No, sir. You’ve got the waffles twisted and the snoffles are upside
down,’ said Polly, who’d often helped in the inn’s yard.

‘Ah, that would be why he was so difficult last night,’ said Blouse. ‘I
suppose I ought to know this sort of thing, but at home we had a man to
do it . . .’

‘Let me, sir,’ said Polly. She untwisted the bridle with a few careful
movements. ‘What’s his name, sir?’

‘Thalacephalos,’ said Blouse sheepishly. ‘That was the legendary
stallion of General Tacticus, you know.’

‘I didn’t know that, sir,’ said Polly. She leaned back and glanced
between the horse’s rear legs. Wow, Blouse really _was_ short-sighted,
wasn’t he . . .

The mare looked at her partly with its eyes, which were small and evil,
but mostly with its yellowing teeth, of which it had an enormous amount.
She had the impression that it was thinking about sniggering.

‘I’ll hold him for you while you mount, sir,’ she said.

‘Thank you. He certainly moves about a bit when I try!’

‘I expect he does, sir,’ said Polly. She knew about difficult horses;
this one had all the hallmarks of a right bastard, one of those not
cowed at all by the obvious superiority of the human race.

The mare eyeballed and yellowtoothed her as Blouse mounted, but Polly
had positioned herself carefully away from the uprights of the shelter.
Thalacephalos wasn’t the sort to buck and kick. She was the sneaky kind,
Polly could see, the sort that stepped on your foot—

She moved her foot just as the hoof came down. But Thalacephalos, angry
at being thwarted, turned, twisted, lowered her head, and bit Polly
sharply on the rolled-up socks.

‘Bad horse!’ said Blouse severely. ‘Sorry about that, Perks. I think
he’s anxious to get to the fray! Oh, my word!’ he added, looking down.
‘Are you all right, Perks?’

‘Well, he’s pulling a bit, sir—’ said Polly, being dragged sideways.
Blouse had gone white again.

‘But he’s bitten . . . he’s caught you by the . . . right on the . . .’

The penny dropped. Polly looked down, and hastily remembered what she’d
heard during numerous rule-free bar fights.

‘Oh . . . ooo . . argh . . . blimey! Right inna fruit! Aargh!’ she
lamented, and then, since it seemed a good idea at the time, brought
both fists down heavily on the mare’s nose. The lieutenant fainted.

It took some time to bring Blouse round, but at least it gave Polly time
to think.

He opened his eyes and focused on her.

‘Er, you fell off your horse, sir,’ Polly volunteered.

‘Perks? Are you all right? Dear boy, he had you by the—’

‘Only needs a few stitches, sir!’ said Polly cheerfully.

‘What? From _Igor_?’

‘Nosir. Just the cloth, sir,’ said Polly. ‘The trousers are a bit big
for me, sir.’

‘Ah, _right_. Too big, eh? Phew, eh? Near miss there, eh? Well, I
mustn’t lie around here all day—’

The squad helped him on to Thalacephalos, who was still sniggering
unrepentantly. On the subject of ‘too big’, Polly made a mental note to
do something about his jacket next time they stopped. She wasn’t much
good with a needle, but if Igor couldn’t do something to make it look
better then he wasn’t the man she thought he was. And that was a
sentence that begged a question.

Jackrum bellowed them into order. They were better at that now. Neater,
too.

‘All right, Ins-and-Outs! Tonight we—’

A set of huge yellow teeth removed his cap.

‘Oh, I do apologize, sergeant!’ said Blouse behind him, trying to rein
back the mare.

‘No bother, sir, these things happen!’ said Jackrum, furiously tugging
his hat back.

‘I should like to address my men, sergeant.’

‘Oh? Er . . . yes, sir,’ said Jackrum, looking worried. ‘Of course, sir.
Ins-and-Outs! Attenwaitforitshun!’

Blouse coughed. ‘Er . . . men,’ he said. ‘As you know, we must make all
speed to the Kneck valley where, apparently, we are needed. Travelling
by night will prevent . . . entanglements. Er . . . I . . .’ He stared
at them, his face contorted by some inner struggle. ‘Er . . . I have to
say I don’t think we are . . . that is, all the evidence is . . . er
. . . it doesn’t seem to me that . . . er . . . I think I should tell
you . . . er . . .’

‘Permission to speak, sir?’ said Polly. ‘Are you feeling all right?’

‘We just have to hope that those put in power over us are making the
right decisions,’ mumbled Blouse. ‘But I have every confidence in you
and I am sure you will do your best. Long live the Duchess! Carry on,
Sergeant Jackrum.’

‘_Ins-and-Outs! Form up! March!_’

And they headed into the dusk and off to war.

The order of march was as last night, with Maladict going on ahead. The
clouds were holding in some heat, and were thin enough to hint at
moonlight here and there. Forests by night held no problems for Polly,
and this wasn’t true wild forest in any case. Nor was it, in truth, a
march that they were doing. It was more like a high-speed creep, in ones
and twos.

She’d acquired two of the horsebows, now stuck awkwardly between the
straps of her pack. They were horrible things, rather like a cross
between a small crossbow and a clock. There were mechanisms in the thick
shaft, and the bow itself was barely six inches across; somehow, if you
leaned your weight on it, you could cock it with enough stored energy to
fire a nasty little metal arrow through an inch-thick plank. They were
blued metal, sleek and evil. But there is an old milit’ry saying: better
me firing it at you than you firing it at me, you bastard.

Polly eased her way along the line until she was walking alongside Igor.
He nodded to her in the gloom, and then turned his attention to walking.
He needed to, because his pack was twice the size of the rest of them.
No one felt inclined to ask him what was in it; sometimes, you thought
you could hear liquid sloshing.

Igors sometimes passed through Munz, although technically they were an
Abomination in the eyes of Nuggan. It had seemed to Polly that using
bits of someone who was dead to help three or four other people stay
alive was a sensible idea, but in the pulpit Father Jupe had argued that
Nuggan didn’t want people to live, he wanted them to live _properly_.
There had been general murmurs of agreement from the congregation, but
Polly knew for a fact that there were a couple of people sitting there
with a hand or arm or leg that was a little less tanned or a little more
hairy than the other one. There were lumberjacks everywhere in the
mountains. Accidents happened, fast, _sudden_ accidents. And, since
there were not many jobs for a one-armed lumberjack, men went off and
found an Igor to do what no amount of prayer could manage.

The Igors had a motto: What goes around, comes around. You didn’t have
to pay them back. You had to pay them forward, and that, frankly, was
the bit where people got worried. When you were dying, an Igor would
mysteriously arrive on the doorstep and request that he be allowed to
take away any bits urgently needed by others on his ‘little litht’. He’d
be quite happy to wait until the priest had gone and, it was said, when
the time came he’d do very neat work. However, it happened quite often
that when an Igor turned up the prospective donor took fright and turned
to Nuggan, who liked _whole_ people. In which case the Igor would
quietly and politely leave, and never come back. He’d never come back to
the whole village, or the whole lumber camp. Nor would other Igors. What
goes around comes around – or stops.

As far as Polly could tell, Igors believed that the body was nothing
more than a more complicated kind of clothing. Oddly enough, that’s what
Nugganites thought, too.

‘Glad you joined, Igor?’ said Polly, as they jogged along.

‘Yeth, Ozz.’

‘Could you take a look at the rupert’s hand next time we stop, please?
He’s cut it badly.’

‘Yeth, Ozz.’

‘Can I ask you something, Igor?’

‘Yeth, Ozz.’

‘What’re female Igors called, Igor?’

Igor stumbled and kept moving. He was silent for a while, and then said:
‘All right, what did I do wrong?’

‘Sometimes you forget to lisp,’ said Polly. ‘But mostly . . . it’s just
a feeling. Little things about the way you move, maybe.’

‘The word you’re looking for is “Igorina”,’ said Igorina. ‘We don’t lisp
as much as the boys.’

They continued in more silence until Polly said, ‘I thought it was bad
enough cutting my hair—’

‘The stitches?’ said Igorina. ‘I can have them out in five minuteth.
They’re just for show.’

Polly hesitated. But, after all, Igors _had_ to be trustworthy, didn’t
they? ‘You didn’t cut your hair?’

‘Actually, I just removed it,’ said Igorina.

‘I put mine in my pack,’ Polly went on, trying not to look at the
stitches around Igorina’s head.

‘So did I,’ said Igorina. ‘In a jar. It’s thtill growing.’

Polly swallowed. You needed a lack of graphic imagination to talk about
personal issues with an Igor. ‘Mine was stolen back at the barracks. I’m
sure it was Strappi,’ she said.

‘Oh dear.’

‘I _hate_ to think of him with it!’

‘Why did you bring it?’

And that was the question. She’d planned, and she’d been good at
planning. She’d fooled the rest of them, even. She’d been cool and
sensible and she hadn’t felt more than a faint pang at cutting off her
hair—

—and she’d brought it with her. Why? She could have thrown it away. It
wasn’t _magic_. It was just hair. She could have thrown it away, just
like that. Easily. But . . . but . . . ah, right, the maids could have
found it. That was it. She had to get it out of the house quickly.
Right. And then she could bury it somewhere when she was a long way
away. Right.

But she hadn’t, had she . . .

She’d been _very busy_. Right, said the little voice in inner treachery.
She had been very busy fooling everyone but herself, right?

‘What could Strappi do?’ said Igorina. ‘Jackrum’d knock him over the
moment he thaw him. He’s a deserter, and a thief!’

‘Yes, but he could tell someone,’ said Polly.

‘Okay, then say it’s a lock of hair from the sweetheart you left behind
you. Lots of soldiers carry a locket or something like that. You know:
“Her golden hair in ringletth fair”, like the song says.’

‘It was _all my hair_! A locket? You couldn’t hold it all in your hat!’

‘Ah,’ said Igorina. ‘Then you could thay you loved her _very much_?’

Despite everything, Polly started to laugh, and couldn’t stop herself.
She bit her sleeve and tried to keep going, with her shoulders shaking.

Something that felt like a small tree prodded her in the back. ‘Youse
two oughta keep der noise down,’ rumbled Jade.

‘Sorry. Sorry,’ hissed Polly.

Igorina started to hum. Polly knew the song.

_I’m lonesome since I crossed the hill_

_And o’er the moor and valley . . ._

And she vowed: not that one, too. One song is enough. And I _want_ to
leave the girl behind me, but it seems I brought her with me . . . At
which point they emerged from the trees and saw the red glow.

The rest of the squad were already gathered round, watching it. It
covered quite a lot of the horizon, and brightened and faded in places
as they watched.

‘Is that hell?’ said Wazzer.

‘No, but men have made it so, I fear,’ said the lieutenant. ‘That is the
Kneck valley.’

‘It’s on fire, sir?’ said Polly.

‘Bless you, that’s just the light of cooking-fires reflected off the
clouds,’ said Sergeant Jackrum. ‘Always looks bad by night, a
battlefield. Not to worry, lads!’

‘What’re they cooking, elephants?’ said Maladict.

‘And what’s that?’ said Polly, pointing to a nearby hill, darker still
against the night. On it, a little light was flickering on and off, very
fast.

There was a whoosh and a metallic ‘pop’ as Blouse pulled out a small
telescope and opened it up. ‘It’s a light clacks, the devils!’ he said.

‘Dere’s another one over dere,’ rumbled Jade, pointing to a hill a lot
further away. ‘Twinkle, twinkle.’

Polly stared at the redness in the sky, and then at the cold little
light, winking on and off. Quiet, soft light. Harmless light. And behind
it, a burning sky . . .

‘It’ll be in code,’ said Blouse. ‘Spies, I’ll be bound.’

‘A light clacks?’ said Tonker. ‘What’s that?’

‘An Abomination in the eyes of Nuggan,’ said Blouse. ‘Unfortunately,
because they’d be damn useful if we could have ’em too, eh, sergeant?’

‘Yessir,’ said Jackrum automatically.

‘The only messages passing through the air should be the prayers of the
faithful. Praise Nuggan, Praise the Duchess and so on and so forth,’
said Blouse, squinting. He sighed. ‘Such a shame. How far to that hill,
would you say, sergeant?’

‘Two miles, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Worth trying to sneak up?’

‘They must know people will see them and come looking, so I expect they
won’t “hang around” for long,’ mused Blouse. ‘In any case, ah, those
things would be highly directional. You’d lose it once you got down in
the valley.’

‘Permission to speak, sir?’ said Polly.

‘Of course,’ said Blouse.

‘How do they get the light so bright, sir? It’s pure white!’

‘Some kind of firework thingy, I believe. Why?’

‘And they send messages with light?’

‘Yes, Perks. And your point is . . .?’

‘And the people who get those messages send messages back the same way?’
Polly persevered.

‘Yes, Perks, that is the whole idea.’

‘Then . . . maybe we don’t have to go all the way to _that_ hill, sir?
The light is being aimed towards _us_, sir.’

They all turned. The hill they were skirting loomed above them.

‘Well done, Perks!’ Blouse whispered. ‘Let’s go, sergeant!’ He swung
himself off the horse, which automatically stepped sideways to make sure
that he fell over when he landed.

‘Right you are, sir!’ said Jackrum, helping him up. ‘Maladict, you take
Goom and Halter and circle round to the left, the rest go round to the
right – not you, Carborundum, no offence, but this has got to be
_quiet_, okay? You stay here. Perks, you come with me—’

‘I shall come too, sergeant,’ said Blouse, and only Polly saw Jackrum
grimace.

‘Good idea, sir!’ said the sergeant. ‘I suggest you – I suggest Perks
and I come with you. Everyone got that? Get to the top neat and quiet
and no one, _no one_ moves until you hear my signal—’

‘_My_ signal,’ said Blouse firmly.

‘That’s what I meant, sir. Quick and quiet! Hit ’em hard but I want at
least one left alive! Go!’

The two teams fanned out to right and left and disappeared. The sergeant
gave them a minute or two’s start, and then set off with unusual speed
for a man of his girth, so that for a moment Polly and the lieutenant
were left standing. Behind them, a dejected Jade watched them go.

The trees thinned out on the steep slope, but not enough for much
underbrush to get a hold. Polly found it easier to go on all fours,
grabbing at tufts and saplings to steady herself. After a while she
caught a whiff of smoke, chemical and acrid. She was sure, too, that she
could hear a faint clicking noise.

A tree extended a hand and pulled her into its shadow. ‘Don’t you say a
bleedin’ word,’ hissed Jackrum. ‘Where’s the rupert?’

‘Don’t know, sarge!’

‘Damn! You can’t let a rupert run around loose, there’s no tellin’ what
he might take it into his little head to do, now he’s got the idea he’s
in charge! You’re ’is minder! Find ’im!’

Polly slithered back down the slope and found Blouse steadying himself
against a tree, wheezing gently.

‘Ah . . . Perks,’ he panted. ‘My asthma seems to . . . be . . . coming
back . . .’

‘I’ll help you up, sir,’ said Polly, grabbing his hand and tugging him
forward. ‘Could you wheeze a little more quietly, sir?’

By degrees, dragging and pushing, she bundled the man up to Jackrum’s
tree.

‘Glad you could join us, sir!’ hissed the sergeant, face contorted into
an expression of maddened affability. ‘If you’d care to wait here, Perks
and me will crawl up the—’

‘I’m coming too, sergeant,’ Blouse insisted.

Jackrum hesitated. ‘Yessir,’ he said. ‘But with respect, sir, I know
about skirmishing—’

‘Let’s go, sergeant,’ said Blouse, dropping flat and beginning to drag
himself forward.

‘Yessir,’ muttered Jackrum darkly.

Polly eased her way forward, too. The grass here was shorter,
rabbit-nibbled, with small bushes here and there. She concentrated on
keeping the noise down, and aimed for the clicking. The smell of
chemical smoke grew stronger. It hung in the air around her. And, as she
moved forward, she saw light, little specks of it. She raised her head.

There were three men a few feet away, silhouetted against the night. One
of them was holding a large pipe, about five feet long, balanced on his
shoulder at one end and on a tripod at the other. That end was aimed at
the distant hill. On the other end, a foot or so behind the man’s head,
was a big square box. Light was leaking from joints in this; from a
little stovepipe chimney on the top of it, heavy smoke poured out.

‘Perks, on the count of three,’ said Jackrum, on Polly’s right. ‘One—’

‘As you were, sergeant,’ said Blouse quietly, on her left.

Polly saw Jackrum’s big florid face turn with an expression of
astonishment. ‘Sir?’

‘Hold position,’ said Blouse. Above them, the clicking continued.

Milit’ry secrets, thought Polly. Spies! Enemies! And we’re just
watching! It was like seeing blood drain from an artery.

‘Sir!’ hissed Jackrum, rage smoking off him.

‘Hold position, sergeant. That is an order,’ said Blouse calmly.

Jackrum subsided, but only into the deceptive calm of a volcano waiting
to explode. The relentless chatter of the clacks went on. It seemed to
go on for ever. Beside Polly, Sergeant Jackrum seethed and fretted like
a dog on a leash.

The clicking stopped. Polly heard a distant murmur of conversation.

‘Sergeant Jackrum,’ whispered Blouse, ‘you may “get them” with all
speed!’

Jackrum exploded out of the grass like a partridge. ‘_All right, my
lads! Up boys and at ’em!_’

Polly’s first thought, as she leapt up and ran, was that the distance
was suddenly a lot wider than it had appeared.

All three men had turned at the sound of Jackrum’s cry. The one with the
clacks tube was already dropping it and reaching for a sword, but
Jackrum was bearing down on him like a landslide. The man made the
mistake of standing his ground. There was a brief clash of swords and
then a mêlée, and Sergeant Jackrum was a sufficiently deadly mêlée all
by himself.

The second man flew past Polly but she was running for the third one. He
backed away from her, still reaching up to his mouth, then turned to run
and found himself face to face with Maladict.

‘Don’t let him swallow!’ Polly yelled.

Maladict’s arm shot up, and lifted the struggling man aloft by his
throat.

It would have been a perfect operation had not the rest of the squad
arrived, having put all their effort into running and left none to spare
for slowing down. There were collisions.

Maladict went down as his captive kicked him in the chest and the man
tried to scramble away, cannoning into Tonker. Polly leapt over Igorina,
was almost tripped by a fallen Wazzer and threw herself desperately
towards the quarry, now on his knees. He had a dagger out and waved it
wildly in front of her while he grasped his throat with his other hand
and made choking noises. She knocked the knife away, ran behind him and
slapped him on the back as hard as she could. He fell forward. Before
she could grab him a hand lifted him bodily and Jackrum’s voice roared:
‘Can’t have the poor man chokin’ to death, Perks!’ His other hand
punched the man in the stomach with a noise like meat hitting a slab.
The man’s eyes crossed and something large and white flew out of his
mouth and shot over Jackrum’s shoulder.

Jackrum dropped him and turned on Blouse. ‘Sir, I protest, sir!’ he
said, quivering with anger. ‘We lay there and watched these devils
sending who knows what messages, sir! Spies, sir! We could’ve got ’em
right there and then, sir!’

‘And then, sergeant?’ said Blouse.

‘What?’

‘Don’t you think the people they were talking to would wonder what had
happened if the messages had stopped in mid-flow?’ said the lieutenant.

‘Even so, sir—’

‘Whereas now we have their device, sergeant, and their masters don’t
know we have it,’ said Blouse.

‘Yeah, well, but you said they was sending messages in code, sir, and—’

‘Er, I think we have their cipher book as well, sarge,’ said Maladict,
stepping forward with the white object in his hand. ‘That man tried to
eat it, sarge. Rice paper. But he rushed his food, you might say.’

‘And you dislodged it, sergeant, and probably saved his life. Well
done!’ said Blouse.

‘But one of ’em got away, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘He’ll soon get to—’

‘_Sergeant?_’

Jade was rising over the grass. As she plodded nearer they saw she was
dragging a man by one foot. When she was closer it was obvious that the
man was dead. Living people have more head.

‘I heard the shoutin’ and he come runnin’ and I jumped up and he come
straight into me, head first!’ Jade complained. ‘I didn’t even get a
chance to hit him!’

‘Well, private, at least we can definitely say he was stopped,’ said
Blouse.

‘Thur, thith man is dying,’ said Igorina, who was kneeling by the man
Sergeant Jackrum had so positively saved from choking. ‘He hath been
poithened!’

‘Hath he? By whom?’ said Blouse. ‘Are you sure?’

‘The green foam coming out of hith mouth ith a definite clue, thur.’

‘What’s funny, Private Maladict?’ said Blouse.

The vampire chuckled. ‘Oh, sorry, sir. They say to spies “If you’re
caught, eat the documents”, don’t they? A good way of making sure they
don’t give away any secrets.’

‘But you’ve got the . . . soggy book in your hands, corporal!’

‘Vampires can’t be poisoned that easily, sir,’ said Maladict calmly.

‘It wath probably only fatal by mouth in any case, thur,’ said Igorina.
‘Terrible stuff. _Th_tuff. He’th dead, thur. Nothing I can do.’

‘Poor fellow. Well, we have the codes, anyway,’ said Blouse. ‘This is a
_great_ discovery, men.’

‘And a prisoner, sir, and a prisoner,’ said Jackrum.

The one surviving man, who had been operating the clacks, groaned and
tried to move.

‘A bit bruised, I expect,’ Jackrum added, with some satisfaction. ‘When
I land on someone, sir, they stay landed on.’

‘Two of you, bring him with us,’ said Blouse. ‘Sergeant, there’s a few
hours to dawn, and I want to be well away from here. I want the other
two buried somewhere down in the woods, and—’

‘You just have to say “carry on, sergeant”, sir,’ said Jackrum, and it
was almost a wail. ‘That’s how it works, sir! You tell me what you want,
I give ’em the orders!’

‘Times are changing, sergeant,’ said Blouse.

Messages, flying across the sky. They were an Abomination unto Nuggan.

The logic sounded impeccable to Polly as she helped Wazzer to dig two
graves. Prayers from the faithful ascended unto Nuggan, going upwards. A
variety of unseen things, such as sanctity and grace and a list of this
week’s Abominations, descended from Nuggan to the faithful, going
downwards. What was forbidden was messages from one human to another
going, as it were, from side to side. There could be collisions. If you
believed in Nuggan, that is. If you believed in prayer.

Wazzer’s real name was Alice, she confided as she dug, but it was hard
to apply the name to a small stick-thin lad with a bad haircut and not
much skill with a shovel, who had a habit of standing just slightly too
close to you and stared just slightly to the left of your face when she
talked to you. Wazzer believed in prayer. She believed in everything.
That made her kind of . . . awkward to talk to, if you didn’t. But Polly
felt she should make the effort.

‘How old are you, Wazz?’ she said, shovelling dirt.

‘N-n-nineteen, Polly,’ said Wazzer.

‘Why’d you join?’

‘The Duchess told me to,’ said Wazzer.

That was why people didn’t talk to Wazzer much.

‘Wazz, you do _know_ that wearing men’s clothes is an Abomination, don’t
you?’

‘Thank you for reminding me, Polly,’ said Wazzer, without a trace of
irony. ‘But the Duchess told me that nothing I do in pursuit of my quest
will be held Abominable.’

‘A quest, eh,’ said Polly, trying to sound jovial. ‘And what kind of
quest is that?’

‘I am to take command of the army,’ said Wazzer.

Hairs rose on the back of Polly’s neck. ‘Yes?’ she said.

‘Yes, the Duchess stepped out of her picture when I was asleep and told
me to go at once to Kneck,’ said Wazzer. ‘The Little Mother spoke to me,
Ozz. She commanded me. She guides my steps. She led me out of vile
slavery. How can that be an Abomination?’

She’s got a sword, thought Polly. And a shovel. This needs careful
handling. ‘That’s nice,’ she said.

‘And . . . and I must tell you that . . . I . . . never in my life have
I felt such love and camaraderie,’ Wazzer went on earnestly. ‘The last
few days have been the happiest of my life. You have all shown me such
kindness, such gentleness. The Little Mother guides me. She guides us
all, Ozz. You believe that, too. Don’t you?’ The moonlight revealed the
tracks of tears in the grime on Wazzer’s cheeks.

‘Um,’ said Polly, and sought wildly for a way to avoid lying. She found
it. ‘Er . . . you know I want to find my brother?’ she said.

‘Well, that does you credit, the Duchess knows,’ said Wazzer quickly.

‘And, well . . . I’m also doing it for The Duchess,’ said Polly, feeling
wretched. ‘I think about The Duchess all the time, I must admit.’ Well,
that was true. It just wasn’t honest.

‘I’m so very glad to hear that, Ozz, because I had thought you were a
backslider,’ said Wazzer. ‘But you said that with such conviction.
Perhaps this would be the time for us to get down on our knees and—’

‘Wazz, you’re standing in another man’s grave,’ said Polly. ‘There’s a
time and place, you know? Let’s get back to the others, eh?’

The happiest days of the girl’s life had been spent tramping through
forests, digging graves and trying to dodge soldiers on both sides? The
trouble with Polly was that she had a mind that asked questions even
when she really, really didn’t want to know the answers.

‘So . . . the Duchess is still talking to you, is she?’ she said, as
they made their way among the dark trees.

‘Oh, yes. When we were in Plotz, sleeping in the barracks,’ said Wazzer.
‘She said it was all working.’

Don’t, _don’t_ ask another question, said part of Polly’s mind, but she
ignored it out of sheer horrible curiosity. Wazzer was nice – well, sort
of nice, in a slightly scary way – but talking to her was like picking
at a scab; you knew what was likely to be under the crust, but you
picked anyway.

‘So . . . what did you use to do back in the world?’ she said.

Wazzer gave her a haunting smile. ‘I used to be beaten.’

Tea was brewing in a small hollow near the track. Several of the squad
were standing guard. No one liked the idea of men in dark clothes
sneaking around.

‘Mug of saloop?’ said Shufti, holding them up. A few days ago they’d
have called it ‘sweet milky tea’, but even if they couldn’t walk the
walk yet they were determined to talk the talk as soon as possible.

‘What’s happening?’ said Polly.

‘Dunno,’ said Shufti. ‘Sarge and the rupert went off over _that_ way
with the prisoner but no one tells us groans anything.’

‘It’s “grunts”, I think,’ said Wazzer, taking the tea.

‘I’ve done them a couple of mugs, anyway. See what you can find out,
eh?’

Polly gulped her tea down, grabbed the mugs and hurried away.

On the edge of the hollow Maladict was lounging against a tree. There
was this about vampires: they could never look scruffy. Instead, they
were . . . what was the word . . . _déshabillé_. It meant untidy, but
with bags and bags of style. In this case Maladict’s jacket was open and
he’d stuck his packet of cigarettes in the band of his shako. He saluted
her with his crossbow as she went past.

‘Ozz?’ he said.

‘Yes, corp?’

‘Any coffee in their packs?’

‘Sorry, corp. Only tea.’

‘Damn!’ Maladict thumped the tree behind him. ‘Hey, you went straight
for the man who was swallowing the cipher. Straight for him. How come?’

‘Just luck,’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, right. Try again. I have very good night vision.’

‘Oh, all right. Well, the one on the left started to run and the one in
the middle was dropping the clacks tube and reaching for his sword, but
the one on the right thought that putting something into his mouth was
more important even than fighting or running away. Satisfied?’

‘You worked out all that in a couple of seconds? That was smart.’

‘Yeah, right. Now _please_ forget it, okay? I don’t want to be noticed.
I don’t particularly want to be here. I just want to find my brother.
Okay?’

‘Fine. I just thought that you’d like to know someone saw you. And you’d
better get that tea to ’em before they try to kill one another.’

At least I was someone watching the enemy, Polly thought furiously as
she walked away. I wasn’t someone watching another soldier. Who does he
think he is? Or she is?

She heard the raised voices as she pushed through a thicket.

‘You can’t torture an unarmed man!’ That was Blouse’s voice.

‘Well, I’m not waiting for him to arm himself, sir! He knows stuff! And
he’s a spy!’

‘Don’t you dare kick him in the ribs again! That is an _order_,
sergeant!’

‘Asking nicely didn’t work, did it, sir? “Pretty please with sprinkles
on top” is not a recognized method of interrogation! You shouldn’t be
here, sir! You should say “Sergeant, find out what you can from the
prisoner!” and then go somewhere and wait until I tell you what I got
out of him, sir!’

‘You did it again!’

‘What? What?’

‘You kicked him again!’

‘No, I didn’t!’

‘Sergeant, I gave you an order!’

‘_And?_’

‘Tea’s up!’ said Polly cheerfully.

Both men turned. Their expression changed. If they had been birds, their
feathers would have gently settled back.

‘Ah, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘Well done.’

‘Yeah . . . good lad,’ said Sergeant Jackrum.

Polly’s presence seemed to lower the temperature. The two men drank
their tea and eyed one another warily.

‘You’ll have noticed, sergeant, that the men were wearing the dark-green
uniform of the First Battalion the Zlobenian Fifty-ninth Bowmen. A
skirmishing battalion,’ said Blouse, with cold politeness. ‘That is not
the uniform of a spy, sergeant.’

‘Yessir? But they’d let their uniforms get very dirty, then. No shine on
the buttons, _sir_.’

‘Patrolling behind enemy lines is not spying, sergeant. You must have
done it in your time.’

‘More times than you could count, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘And I knew full
well that if I got caught I was due a good kicking in the nadgers. But
skirmishers is the worst, sir. You think you’re safe in the lines, next
moment it turns out that some _bastard_ sitting in the bushes on a hill
has been working out windage and yardage and has dropped an arrow right
through your mate’s head.’ He picked up a strange-looking longbow. ‘See
these things they’ve got? Burleigh and Stronginthearm Number Five
Recurved, made in bloody Ankh-Morpork. A real killing weapon. I say we
give him a choice, sir. He can tell us what he knows, and go out easy.
Or keep mum, and go out hard.’

‘_No_, sergeant. He is an enemy officer taken in battle and entitled to
fair treatment.’

‘No, sir. He’s a sergeant, and they don’t deserve no respect at all,
sir. I should know. They’re cunning and artful, if they’re any good. I
wouldn’t mind if he was an officer, sir. But sergeants are _clever_.’

There was a grunt from the bound prisoner.

‘Loosen his gag, Perks,’ said Blouse. Instinctively, even if the
instinct was only a couple of days old, Polly glanced at Jackrum. The
sergeant shrugged. She pulled the rag down.

‘I’ll talk,’ said the prisoner, spitting out cotton fluff. ‘But not to
that tub of lard! I’ll talk to the officer. You keep that man away from
me!’

‘You’re in no position to negotiate, soldier boy!’ snarled Jackrum.

‘Sergeant,’ said the lieutenant, ‘I’m sure you have things to see to.
Please do so. Send a couple of men back here. He can’t do anything
against four of us.’

‘But—’

‘That was _another_ order, sergeant,’ said Blouse. He turned to the
prisoner as Jackrum stumped off. ‘What is your name, man?’

‘Sergeant Towering, lieutenant. And if you are a sensible man, you will
release me and surrender.’

‘Surrender?’ said Blouse, as Igorina and Wazzer ran into the clearing,
armed and bewildered.

‘Yep. I’ll put in a good word for you when the boys catch up with us.
You don’t want to know how many men are looking for you. Could I have a
drink, please?’

‘What? Oh, yes. Of course,’ said Blouse, as if caught out in a display
of bad manners. ‘Perks, fetch some tea for the sergeant. Why are people
looking for us, pray?’

Towering gave him a cockeyed grin. ‘You don’t know?’

‘No,’ said Blouse coldly.

‘You _really_ don’t know?’ Now Towering was laughing. He was far too
relaxed for a bound man, and Blouse sounded far too much like a nice but
worried man trying to appear firm and determined. To Polly, it was like
watching a child bluffing in poker against a man called Doc.

‘I don’t wish to play games, man. Out with it!’ said Blouse.

‘Everyone knows about _you_, lieutenant. You’re the Monstrous Regiment,
you are!’ he said. ‘No offence meant, of course. They say you’ve got a
troll and a vampire and an Igor and a werewolf. They say you . . .’ he
began to chuckle ‘. . . they say you overpowered Prince Heinrich and his
guard and stole his boots and made him hop away in the altogether!’

In a thicket some way off, a nightingale sang. For quite a while,
uninterrupted. Then Blouse said, ‘Hah, no, you are in fact wrong. The
man was Captain Horentz—’

‘Yeah, right, like he’d tell _you_ who he was with you pointing swords
at him!’ said Towering. ‘I heard from one of my mates that one of you
kicked him in the meat-and-two-veg, but I haven’t seen the picture yet.’

‘Someone took a picture of him getting kicked?’ squeaked Polly, drenched
in a sudden horror.

‘Not of that, no. But there’s copies all over the place of him in chains
and I hear it’s been sent by the clacks to Ankh-Morpork.’

‘Is . . . is he annoyed?’ Polly quavered, cursing Otto Chriek and his
picture-making.

‘Well, now, let me see,’ said Towering sarcastically. ‘Annoyed? No, I
shouldn’t think he’s annoyed. “Livid” is the word, I think. Or “raging”
? Yeah, I think “raging”’s the word. There’s a lot of people looking for
you lads now. Well done!’

Even Blouse could see Polly’s distress. ‘Er . . . Perks,’ he said, ‘it
was you, wasn’t it, who—’

Over and over in Polly’s head the words
_ogodIkickedthePrinceinthefruitandveg_ were going round and round like a
hamster in a runaway treadmill until, suddenly, it ran up against
something solid.

‘Yessir,’ she snapped. ‘He was forcing himself upon a young woman, sir.
If you recall?’

Blouse’s frown faded, and became a grin of childlike duplicity. ‘Ah,
yes, indeed. He was “pressing his suit” in no small way, was he not?’

‘He didn’t have ironing in mind, sir!’ said Polly fervently.

Towering glanced at Wazzer, grimly clutching a crossbow that Polly knew
for a fact she was scared of, and Igorina, who’d much rather be holding
a surgeon’s knife than the sabre in her hand and looked worried sick.
Polly saw his brief smile.

‘And there you have it, Sergeant Towering,’ said the lieutenant, turning
to the prisoner. ‘Of course, we all know there is some atrocious
behaviour in times of war, but it is not the sort of thing we would
expect of a royal prince.⁵ If we are to be pursued because a gallant
young soldier prevented matters from becoming even more disgusting, then
so be it.’

‘Now I _am_ impressed,’ said Towering. ‘A real knight errant, eh? He’s a
credit to you, lieutenant. Any chance of that tea?’

Blouse’s skinny chest visibly swelled at the compliment. ‘Yes, Perks,
the tea, if you would be so good.’

Leaving the three of you with this man who’s positively radiating an
intention to escape, Polly thought. ‘Could perhaps Private Goom go and
fetch—’ she began.

‘A word in private, Perks?’ snapped Blouse. He drew her closer, but
Polly kept her eye on Sergeant Towering. He might be bound hand and
foot, but she wouldn’t have trusted a man who grinned like that if he’d
been nailed to the ceiling.

‘Perks, you are making a great contribution but I really will not have
my orders continually questioned,’ said Blouse. ‘You are my batman,
after all. I think I run a “happy ship” here, but I will be obeyed.
Please?’

It was like being savaged by a goldfish, but she had to admit he had a
point. ‘Er . . . sorry, sir,’ she said, backing away as long as possible
so as not to miss the end of the tragedy. Then she turned and ran.

Jackrum was sitting by the fire, with the prisoner’s bow across his huge
knees, slicing some sort of black sausage with a big clasp-knife. He was
chewing.

‘Where’s the rest of us, sir?’ said Polly, scrabbling for a mug.

‘I sent ’em to scout a wide perimeter, Perks. Can’t be too careful if
matey-boy’s got pals out there.’

. . . which was perfectly sensible. It just happened to mean that half
the squad had been sent away . . .

‘Sarge, you know that captain back at the barracks? That was—’

‘I’ve got good hearing, Perks. Kicked him in the Royal Prerogative, eh?
Hah! Makes it all more interestin’, eh?’

‘It’s going to go wrong, sarge, I just _know_ it,’ said Polly, dragging
the kettle off the hob and spilling half the water as she topped up the
teapot.

‘D’you chew at all, Perks?’ said Jackrum.

‘What, sarge?’ said Polly distractedly.

The sergeant held out a small piece of sticky, black . . . stuff.
‘Tobacco. Chewing tobacco,’ said Jackrum. ‘I favour Blackheart over
Jolly Sailor, ’cos it’s rum-dipped, but others say—’

‘Sarge, that man’s going to escape, sarge! I know he is! The lieutenant
isn’t in charge, _he_ is. He’s all friendly and everything, but I can
tell by his eyes, sarge!’

‘I’m sure Lieutenant Blouse knows what he’s doing, Perks,’ said Jackrum
primly. ‘You’re not telling me a bound man can overcome four of you, are
you?’

‘Oh, _sugar_!’ said Polly.

‘Just down there, in the old black tin,’ said Jackrum. Polly tipped some
into the worst cup of tea ever made by a serving soldier and ran back to
the clearing.

Amazingly, the man was still in a sitting position, and still bound hand
and foot. Her fellow Cheesemongers were watching him dejectedly. Polly
relaxed, but only a little.

‘—nd there _you_ have it, lieutenant,’ he was saying. ‘No disgrace in
calling it quits, eh? He’ll hunt you down soon enough, ’cos it’s
_personal_ now. But if you were to come along with me, I’d do my best to
see it goes easy with you. You don’t want to get caught by the Heavy
Dragoons right now. They ain’t got much of a sense of humour—’

‘Tea up,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, thank you, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘I think we can at least cut
Sergeant Towering’s hands free, don’t you?’

‘Yes, sir,’ said Polly, meaning ‘no, sir’. The man offered his bound
wrists, and Polly reached out gingerly with her knife while holding the
mug like a weapon.

‘Artful lad you’ve got here, lieutenant,’ said Towering. ‘He reckons I’m
going to grab his knife off of him. Good lad.’

Polly sliced the rope, brought her knife hand back quickly, and then
carefully proffered the mug.

‘_And_ he’s made the tea lukewarm so’s it won’t hurt when I splashes it
in his face,’ Towering went on. He gave Polly the steady, honest gaze of
the born bastard.

Polly held it, lie for lie.

‘Oh, yeah. The Ankh-Morpork people’ve got a little printing press on a
cart, over on the other side of the river,’ said Towering, still
watching Polly. ‘For morale, they say. And they sent the picture back to
the city, too, on the clacks. Don’t ask me how. Oh yeah, a good picture.
“Plucky Rookies Trounce Zlobenia’s Finest”, they wrote. Funny thing, but
it looks like the writer man didn’t spot it was the Prince. But we all
did!’

His voice became even more friendly. ‘Now look, mates, as a foot soldier
like yourselves I’m all for seeing the bloody donkey-boys made to look
fools, so you come along with me and I’ll see to it that at least you
don’t sleep in chains tomorrow. That’s my best offer.’ He took a sip of
tea, and added, ‘It’s a better one than most of the Tenth got, I’ll tell
you. I heard your regiment got wiped out.’

Polly’s expression didn’t change, but she felt herself curl up into a
tiny ball behind it. Look at the eyes, look at the eyes. _Liar. Liar._

‘Wiped out?’ said Blouse.

Towering dropped his mug of tea. He smacked the crossbow out of Wazzer’s
hand with his left hand, grabbed the sabre from Igorina with his right
hand, and brought the curved blade down on the rope between his legs. It
happened fast, before any of them could quite focus on the change in the
situation, and then the sergeant was on his feet, slapping Blouse across
the face and grabbing him in an arm lock.

‘And you were _right_, kiddo,’ he said to Polly, over Blouse’s shoulder.
‘Cryin’ shame you ain’t an officer, eh?’

The last of the fallen tea dribbled into the soil. Polly reached slowly
for her crossbow.

‘Don’t. One step, one move from any of you, and I’ll cut him,’ said the
sergeant. ‘Won’t be the first officer I’ve killed, believe me—’

‘_The difference between them and me is, I don’t care_.’

Five heads turned. There was Jackrum, outlined against the distant
firelight. He had the man’s own bow, drawn taut, and aimed directly at
the sergeant in complete disregard of the fact that the lieutenant’s
head was in the way. Blouse closed his eyes.

‘You’d shoot your own officer?’ said Towering.

‘Yep. Won’t be the first officer _I’ve_ killed, neither,’ said Jackrum.
‘You ain’t going anywhere, friend, except down. Easy or hard . . . I
don’t care.’ The bow creaked.

‘You’re just bluffing, mister.’

‘Upon my oath, I am not a bluffing man. I don’t think we was ever
introduced, by the way. Jackrum’s the name.’

The change in the man was a whole body event. He seemed to get smaller,
as if every cell had said ‘oh dear’ very quietly to itself. He sagged,
and Blouse slumped a little.

‘Can I—’

‘Too late,’ said Jackrum.

Polly never forgot the sound the arrow made.

There was silence, and then a thump as Towering’s body finally
overbalanced and hit the ground.

Jackrum laid the bow aside carefully. ‘Found out who he was messing
with,’ he said, as if nothing much had happened. ‘Shame, really. Seemed
like a decent sort. Any saloop left, Perks?’

Very slowly, Lieutenant Blouse raised his hand to his ear, which the
arrow had perforated en route to its target, and then looked with
strange detachment at the blood on his fingers.

‘Oh, sorry about that, sir,’ said Jackrum jovially. ‘Just saw the one
chance and I thought, well, it’s the fleshy part. Get yourself a gold
earring, sir, and you’ll be the height of fashion! Quite a large gold
earring, maybe.

‘Don’t you all believe that stuff about the Ins-and-Outs,’ Jackrum went
on. ‘That was just lies. I like it when something’s up. So what we do
now is . . . can anyone tell me what we do now?’

‘Er . . . bury the body?’ hazarded Igorina.

‘Yeah, but check his boots. He’s got small feet and the Zlobenians have
much better boots than us.’

‘Steal the boots off a dead man, sarge?’ said Wazzer, still in shock.

‘Easier than getting ’em off a live one!’ Jackrum softened his voice a
little when he saw their expressions. ‘Lads, this is war, understand? He
was a soldier, they were soldiers, you are soldiers . . . more or less.
No soldier will see scran or good boots go to waste. Bury ’em decent and
say what prayers you can remember, and hope they’ve gone where there’s
no fighting.’ He raised his voice back to the normal bellow. ‘Perks,
round up the others! Igor, cover the fire, try to make it look like we
were never here! We are moving out in number ten minutes! Can make a few
miles before full daylight! That’s right, eh, lieutenant?’

Blouse was still transfixed, but seemed to wake up now. ‘What? Oh. Yes.
Right. Yes, indeed. Er . . . yes. Carry on, sergeant.’

The fire gleamed off Jackrum’s triumphal face. In the red glow his
little dark eyes were like holes in space, his grinning mouth the
gateway to a hell, his bulk some monster from the Abyss.

He let it happen, Polly knew. He obeyed orders. He didn’t do anything
wrong. But he could have sent Maladict and Jade to help us, instead of
Wazzer and Igor, who aren’t quick with weapons. He sent the others away.
He had the bow ready. He played a game with us as pieces, and won . . .

_Poor old soldier_, her father and his friends had sung, while frost
formed on the window panes, _poor old soldier! If ever I ’list for a
soldier again_ . . . _the devil shall be my sergeant!_

In the firelight the grin of Sergeant Jackrum was a crescent of blood,
his coat the colour of a battlefield sky. ‘You are my little lads,’ he
roared. ‘And _I_ will look after _you_.’

They made more than six miles before Jackrum called a halt, and already
the land was changing. There were more rocks, fewer trees. The Kneck
valley was rich and fertile and it was from here that the fertility had
been washed; it was a landscape of ravines and thick scrub woodland,
with a few small communities scratching a living from the
poverty-stricken soil. It was a good place to hide. And, in here,
someone had already hidden. It was a stream-carved gully, but here at
the end of summer the stream was just a trickle between the rocks.
Jackrum must have found it by smell, because you couldn’t see it from
the track.

The ashes of the fire in the small gully were still warm. The sergeant
got up, awkwardly, after inspecting them. ‘Some lads like our pals from
last night,’ he said.

‘Couldn’t it just be a hunter, sarge?’ said Maladict.

‘It could, corporal, but it ain’t,’ said Jackrum. ‘I brought you in here
’cos it looks like a blind gully and there’s water and there’s good
vantage points up _there_ and over _there_,’ he pointed, ‘and there’s a
decent overhang to keep the weather off and it’s hard for anyone to
creep up on us. Milit’ry, in other words. And someone else thought the
same as me last night. So while they’re out there looking for us, we’ll
sit snug where they’ve already looked. Get a couple of lads up on guard
right now.’

Polly drew first watch, atop the small cliff at the edge of the gully.
It _was_ a good site, no doubt about it. A regiment could hide here. No
one could get near without being seen, too. And she was pulling her
weight like a proper member of the squad, so with any luck Blouse would
find someone to shave him before she was off duty. Through a gap in the
treetops below she could see a road of sorts running through the
woodland. She kept an eye on it.

Eventually, Tonker relieved her with a cup of soup. On the far side of
the gully, Wazzer was being replaced by Lofty.

‘Where’re you from, Ozz?’ said Tonker, while Polly savoured the soup.

There couldn’t be any harm in telling. ‘Munz,’ said Polly.

‘Really? Someone said you worked in a bar. What was the inn called?’

Ah . . . there was the harm, right there. But she could hardly lie, now.
‘The Duchess,’ she said.

‘That big place? Very nobby. Did they treat you okay?’

‘What? Oh . . . yes. Yes. Pretty fair.’

‘Hit you at all?’

‘Eh? No. Never,’ said Polly, nervous of where this was going.

‘Work you hard?’

Polly had to consider this. In truth, she worked harder than both the
maids, and they at least had an afternoon off every week.

‘I was usually the first one up and the last one to bed, if that’s what
you mean,’ she said. And to change the subject quickly, she went on:
‘What about you? You know Munz?’

‘We both lived there, me and Tilda— I mean Lofty,’ said Tonker.

‘Oh? Where?’

‘The Girls’ Working School,’ said Tonker, and looked away.

And that’s the kind of trap small talk can get you in, Polly thought.
‘Not a nice place, I think,’ she said, feeling stupid.

‘It was not a nice place, yes. A very nasty place,’ said Tonker. ‘Wazzer
was there, we think. We _think_ it was her. Used to be sent out a lot on
work hire.’ Polly nodded. Once, a girl from the school came and worked
as a maid at The Duchess. She’d arrive every morning, scrubbed raw in a
clean pinafore, peeling off from a line of very similar girls led by a
teacher and flanked by a couple of large men with long sticks. She was
skinny, polite in a dull, trained sort of way, worked very hard and
never talked to anybody. She was gone in three months, and Polly never
found out why.

Tonker stared into Polly’s eyes, almost mocking her innocence. ‘We think
she was the one they used to lock up sometimes in the special room.
That’s the thing about the school. If you don’t toughen up you go funny
in the head.’

‘I expect you were glad to leave,’ was all Polly could think of to say.

‘The basement window was unlocked,’ said Tonker. ‘But I promised Tilda
we’d go back one day next summer.’

‘Oh, so it wasn’t that bad, then?’ said Polly, grateful for some relief.

‘No, it’ll burn better,’ said Tonker. ‘Ever run across someone called
Father Jupe?’

‘Oh, yes,’ said Polly, and, feeling that something more was expected of
her, added, ‘He used to come to dinner when my mother— he used to come
to dinner. A bit pompous, but he seemed okay.’

‘Yes,’ said Tonker. ‘He was good at seeming.’

Once again there was a dark chasm in the conversation that not even a
troll could bridge, and all you could do was draw back from the edge.

‘I’d better go and see to the lieu— to the rupert,’ Polly said, standing
up. ‘Thank you very much for the soup.’

She worked her way down through the scree and birch thickets until she
emerged by the little stream that ran through the gully. And there, like
some awful river god, was Sergeant Jackrum.

His red coat, a tent for lesser men, was draped carefully over a bush.
He himself was sitting on a rock with his shirt off and his huge braces
dangling, so that only a yellowing woolly vest saved the world from a
sight of the man’s bare chests. For some reason, though, he’d kept his
shako on. His shaving kit, with a razor like a small machete and a
shaving brush you could use to hang wallpaper, was on the rock beside
him.

Jackrum was bathing his feet in the stream. He glanced up when Polly
approached, and nodded amiably. ‘’morning, Perks,’ he said. ‘Don’t rush.
Never rush for ruperts. Sit down for a spell. Get yer boots off. Let yer
feet feel the fresh air. Look after your feet, and your feet will look
after you.’ He pulled out his big clasp-knife and the rope of chewing
tobacco. ‘Sure you won’t join me?’

‘No thanks, sarge.’ Polly sat down on a rock on the opposite side of the
stream, which was only a few feet wide, and started to tug at her boots.
She felt as though she’d been given an order. Besides, right now she
felt she needed the shock of clean, cold water.

‘Good lad. Filthy habit. Worse’n the smokes,’ said Jackrum, carving off
a lump. ‘Got started on it when I was but a lad. Better’n striking a
light at night, see? Don’t want to give away your position. ’course, you
gotta gob a bundle every so often, but gobbin’ in the dark don’t show
up.’

Polly dabbled her feet. The icy water did indeed feel refreshing. It
seemed to jolt her alive. In the trees around the gully, birds sang.

‘Say it, Perks,’ said Jackrum, after a while.

‘Say what, sarge?’

‘Oh, bleedin’ hell, Perks, it’s a nice day, don’t muck me around. I seen
the way you’ve been looking at me.’

‘All right, sarge. You murdered that man last night.’

‘Really? Prove it,’ said Jackrum calmly.

‘Well, I can’t, can I? But you set it up. You even sent Igor and Wazzer
to guard him. They’re not good with weapons.’

‘How good would they have to be, d’you think? Four of you against a man
tied up?’ said Jackrum. ‘Nah. That sergeant was dead the moment we got
’im, and he knew it. It took a bloody genius like your rupert to make
him think he’d got a chance. We’re out in the woods, lad. What was
Blouse gonna do with him? Who’d we hand him over to? Would the
lieutenant cart him around with us? Or tie him to a tree and leave him
to kick wolves away until he gets too tired? Much more _gentlemanly_
than giving him a quiet cigarette and a swift chop where you go quick,
which is what he was expecting and what I’d have given him.’

Jackrum popped the tobacco into his mouth. ‘You know what most of the
milit’ry training is, Perks?’ he went on. ‘All that yelling from little
spitbubs like Strappi? It’s to turn you into a man who will, on the word
of command, stick his blade into some poor sod just like him who happens
to be wearing the wrong uniform. He’s like you, you’re like him. He
doesn’t really want to kill you, you don’t really want to kill him. But
if you don’t kill him first, he’ll kill you. That’s the start and finish
of it. It don’t come easy without trainin’. Ruperts don’t get that
trainin’, ’cos they are _gentlemen_. Well, upon my oath I am no
gentleman, and I’ll kill when I have to, and I said I’d keep you safe
and no damn rupert’s going to stop me. He gave me my discharge papers!’
Jackrum added, radiating indignance. ‘_Me!_ And expected me to thank
him! Every other rupert I’ve served under has had the sense to write
“Not posted here” or “On extended patrol” or something and shove it back
in the mail, but not _him_.’

‘What was it you said to Corporal Strappi that made him run away?’ said
Polly, before she could stop herself.

Jackrum looked at her for a while, with no expression in his eyes. Then
he gave a strange little chuckle. ‘Now why would a little lad like you
say a little thing like that?’ he said.

‘Because he just vanished and suddenly some old rule means you’re back
on the strength, sarge,’ said Polly. ‘That’s why I said that little
thing.’

‘Hah! And there’s no such rule, either, not like that one,’ said
Jackrum, splashing his feet. ‘But ruperts never read the book of rules
unless they’re trying to find a reason to hang you, so I was safe there.
Strappi was scared shitless, you know that.’

‘Yes, but he could have slipped away later on,’ said Polly. ‘He wasn’t
_stupid_. Rushing off into the night? He must’ve had something real
_close_ to run from, right?’

‘Cor, that’s an evil brain you have there, Perks,’ said Jackrum happily.
Once again Polly had the definite feeling that the sergeant was enjoying
this, just as he’d seemed pleased when she’d protested about the
uniform. He wasn’t a bully like Strappi – he treated Igorina and Wazzer
with something approaching fatherly concern – but with Polly and
Maladict and Tonker he pushed all the time, wanting you to push back.

‘It does the job, sarge,’ she said.

‘I just had a little tate-ah-tate with him, as it were. Quiet, like.
Explained all the nasty things that can happen vees-ah-vee the confusion
o’ war.’

‘Like being found with his throat cut?’ said Polly.

‘Has been known to happen,’ said Jackrum innocently. ‘You know, lad,
you’re going to make a damn good sergeant one day. Any fool can use his
eyes and ears, but you uses that brain to connect ’em up.’

‘I’m not going to be a sergeant! I’m going to get the job done and go
home!’ said Polly vehemently.

‘Yes, I said that once, too.’ Jackrum grinned. ‘Perks, I don’t need no
clacky thing. I don’t need no newsy paper. Sergeant Jackrum knows what’s
going on. He talks to the men coming back, the ones that won’t talk to
anyone else. I know more than the rupert, for all that he gets little
letters from HQ that worry him so much. Everyone talks to Sergeant
Jackrum. And in his big fat head, Sergeant Jackrum puts it all together.
Sergeant Jackrum knows what’s going on.’

‘And what’s that, sarge?’ said Polly innocently.

Jackrum didn’t reply immediately. Instead, he reached down with a grunt
and rubbed one of his feet. The corroded shilling on a string, which had
lain innocently on the woollen vest, swung forward. But there was
something else. For a moment something golden slipped out of the vest’s
open neck. Something oval and golden, on a golden chain, flashed in the
sunlight. Then he straightened up and it was dragged back out of sight.

‘This is a bloody odd war, lad,’ he said. ‘It’s true there’s not just
Zlobenian soldiers out there. Lads say there’s uniforms they’d never
seen before. We’ve kicked a lot of backsides over the years, so maybe
they really have ganged up and it’s gonna be our turn. But what I reckon
is, they’re stuck. They took the keep. Oh, yes, I know. But they’ve got
to hold on to it. And winter’s coming and all those lads from
Ankh-Morpork and everywhere are a long way from home. We might have a
chance yet. Hah, especially now the Prince is dead set on finding the
young soldier that kneed him in the wedding tackle. That means he’s
angry. He’ll make mistakes.’

‘Well, sarge, I think—’

‘I’m glad you do, Private Perks,’ said Jackrum, suddenly becoming a
sergeant again. ‘And _I_ think that after you’ve seen to the rupert and
had a nap, you and me is going to show the lads some swordsmanship.
Whatever bleedin’ war this is, sooner or later young Wazzer is going to
_have_ to use that blade he waggles about. Get going!’

Polly found Lieutenant Blouse sitting with his back to the cliff, eating
scubbo out of a bowl. Igorina was packing away her medical kit, and
Blouse’s ear was bandaged.

‘Everything all right, sir ?’ she said. ‘Sorry I wasn’t—’

‘I quite understand, Perks, you must stand your turn like the other
“lads”,’ said Blouse, and Polly _heard_ the inverted commas clank into
place. ‘I had a refreshing nap and the bleeding and, indeed, the shaking
has quite stopped. However . . . I do still need a shave.’

‘You want me to shave you,’ said Polly, her heart sinking.

‘I must set an example, Perks, but I have to say you “lads” make such an
effort it puts me to shame. You all seem to have faces “as smooth as a
baby’s bottom”, I must say!’

‘Yes, sir.’ Polly pulled out the shaving gear and walked over to the
fire, where the kettle was permanently boiling. Most of the squad was
dozing, but Maladict was sitting cross-legged by the fire, doing
something to his hat.

‘Heard about the prisoner last night,’ he said, without looking up. ‘I
don’t think the el-tee is going to last very long, do you?’

‘The who?’

‘The lieutenant. From what I hear, Blouse’s probably going to have a
nasty accident. Jackrum thinks he’s dangerous.’

‘He’s learning, just like us.’

‘Yes, but the el-tee’s supposed to know what to _do_. Do you think he
does?’

‘Jackrum’s stuck, too,’ said Polly, topping up the kettle with cold
water. ‘I think we just keep going.’

‘If there’s anything there to get to,’ said Maladict. He held up the
shako. ‘What do you think?’

The words ‘Born To Die’ had been chalked on the side of the hat, next to
the packet of cigarettes.

‘Very . . . individual,’ said Polly. ‘Why do you smoke? It’s not very
. . . vampire, really.’

‘Well, I’m not supposed to be _very_ vampire,’ said Maladict, lighting
up with a shaking hand. ‘It’s the sucking. I need it. I’m on edge. I’m
getting the no-coffee jitters. I’m not good with woods in any case.’

‘But you’re a vam—’

‘Yeah, yeah, if this was crypts, no problem. But I keep thinking I’m
surrounded by lots of pointy stakes. Truth is . . . I’m beginning to
_hurt_. It’s like going cold bat all over again! I’m getting the voices
and the sweats . . .’

‘Sssh,’ said Polly, as Shufti grunted in her sleep. ‘You can’t be,’ she
hissed. ‘You said you’d been going straight for two years!’

‘Oh, _bl . . . blur . . . blood_ ?’ said Maladict. ‘Who said anything
about blood? I’m talking about coffee, dammit!’

‘We’ve got plenty of tea—’ Polly began.

‘You don’t understand! This is about . . . craving. You never _stop_
craving, you just switch it to something that doesn’t cause people to
turn you into a short kebab! I _need_ coffee!’

Why me? Polly thought. Do I have this little sign on me saying ‘Tell me
your troubles’? ‘I’ll see what I can do,’ she said, and hastily filled
the shaving mug.

Polly hurried back with the water, ushered Blouse to a rock, and stirred
up some foam. She sharpened the razor, taking as long as she dared. When
he coughed impatiently she took up position, raised the razor, and
prayed . . .

. . . _but not to Nuggan. Never to Nuggan, since her mother died_ . . .

And then Lofty was running across the ground, trying to shout a whisper.
‘Movement!’

Blouse nearly lost another earlobe.

Out from nowhere came Jackrum, boots on but braces dangling. He grabbed
Lofty by the shoulder and swung her round. ‘Where?’ he demanded.

‘There’s a track down there! Troopers! Carts! What do we do, sarge?’

‘We keep the noise down!’ muttered Jackrum. ‘Are they heading up here?’

‘No, they went right past, sarge!’

Jackrum turned and gave the rest of the squad a satisfied look. ‘O-kay.
Corporal, take Carborundum and Perks and go and have a look. The rest of
you, tool up and try to be brave. Eh, lieutenant?’

Blouse bemusedly dabbed foam off his face. ‘What? Oh. Yes. See to it,
sergeant.’

Twenty seconds later, Polly was running after Maladict, down the slope.
Here and there the bottom of the valley could be seen through the trees,
and as she glanced down she saw sunlight flash off something metal. At
least the trees had coated the woodland floor with a thick layer of
needles, and, contrary to received opinion, most woods aren’t littered
with branches that snap loudly. They reached the edge of the wood, where
bushes fought one another for their place in the sun, and found a spot
with a view.

There were only four troopers, in an unfamiliar uniform, riding in pairs
ahead of and behind a cart. It was small, and had a canvas cover.

‘What’s in a little cart that four men have to protect?’ said Maladict.
‘It must be valuable!’

Polly pointed to the huge flag that hung limply from a pole on the
wagon. ‘I think it’s the newspaper man,’ she said. ‘It’s the same cart.
Same flag, too.’

‘Then it’s a good thing they’ve gone right past,’ hissed Maladict.
‘Let’s just see them out of sight and creep away like good little mice,
okay?’

The party was travelling at the speed of the cart and, at this point,
the two riders in the lead stopped and turned in their saddles, waiting
for it to catch up. Then one of them pointed, back past the hidden
watchers. There was a shout, too far away to be understood. The troopers
in the rear trotted up to the cart, met with their comrades, and all
four turned to look up. There was some discussion, and two riders
trotted back along the road.

‘Oh, darn,’ said Polly. ‘What have they spotted?’

The horsemen went past their hiding place. A few moments later, they
heard the horses enter the woods.

‘Do we run an’ get ’em?’ said Jade.

‘Let Jackrum do that,’ said Maladict.

‘But if he does, and the men don’t come back—’ Polly began.

‘_When_ they don’t come back,’ Maladict corrected her.

‘—then those other two will get suspicious, won’t they? One will
probably stay here, the other will go to get help.’

‘Then we’ll sneak up and wait,’ said Maladict. ‘Look, they’ve
dismounted. The cart’s pulled in, too. If they look as though they’re
worried, we’ll move in.’

‘And do what, exactly?’ said Polly.

‘Threaten to shoot them,’ said Maladict firmly.

‘And if they don’t believe us?’

‘Then we’ll threaten to shoot them _in a much louder voice_,’ said
Maladict. ‘Happy? And I hope to hell they’ve got some coffee!’

There are three things a soldier wants to do when there’s a respite on
the road. One involves lighting a cigarette, one involves lighting a
fire, and the other one involves no flames at all but does, generally,
require a tree.⁶

The two troopers had a fire going and a billy-can steaming when a young
man jumped down from the cart, stretched his arms, looked around,
yawned, and sauntered a little way into the forest. He found a
convenient tree and, a moment later, was apparently examining the bark
at eye height with studied enthusiasm.

The tip of a steel crossbow bolt pressed against the back of his neck
and a voice said: ‘Raise your hands and turn around slowly!’

‘What, right _now_?’

‘Um . . . all right, no. You can finish what you’re doing.’

‘Actually I think that’s going to be quite impossible. Let me just, er
. . . right. Okay.’ The man raised his hands again. ‘You realize I just
have to shout?’

‘So?’ said Polly. ‘I just have to pull this trigger. Shall we have a
race?’

The man turned round.

‘See?’ said Polly, stepping back. ‘It’s him again. De Worde. The writer
man.’

‘You’re _them_!’ he said.

‘Dem who?’ said Jade.

‘Oh _dear_,’ said Maladict.

‘Look, I’d give _anything_ to talk to you!’ said de Worde. ‘Please?’

‘You’re with the enemy!’ hissed Polly.

‘What? Them? No! They’re from Lord Rust’s regiment. From Ankh-Morpork!
They’ve been sent to protect us!’

‘Troops to protect you in Borogravia?’ said Maladict. ‘Who from?’

‘You mean from whom? Er . . . well . . . you, in theory.’

Jade leaned down. ‘_Efficient_, aren’t dey . . .’

‘Look, I _must_ talk to you,’ said the man urgently. ‘This is
astounding! Everyone’s looking for you! Did you kill that old couple in
the woods?’

Birds sang. Far off, there was the call of the female blue-capped
woodpecker.

‘A patrol found the fresh graves,’ said de Worde.

High above an ice heron, a winter migrant from the Hub, gave an ugly
honk as it searched for lakes.

‘I take it you didn’t, then,’ said de Worde.

‘We buried them,’ said Maladict coldly. ‘We don’t know who killed them.’

‘We did take some vegetables,’ said Polly. She remembered laughing about
it. Admittedly it was only because it was that or start crying, but even
so . . .

‘You’ve been living off the land?’ He’d tugged a notebook out of his
pocket and was scribbling in it with a pencil.

‘We don’t have to talk to you,’ said Maladict.

‘No, no, you must! There’s so much you need to know! You’re in the . . .
Ups-and-Downs, right?’

‘Ins-and-Outs,’ said Polly.

‘And you—’the man began.

‘I’ve had enough of this,’ said Maladict, and marched away from the tree
and into the clearing. The two cavalry men looked up from their fire,
and there was a moment of immobility before one reached for his sword.

Maladict swung the bow quickly from one to the other, its point
hypnotizing them like a swinging watch. ‘I’ve got only one shot but
there’s two of you,’ he said. ‘Who shall I shoot? _You_ choose. Now,
listen very carefully: where’s your coffee? You’ve got coffee, haven’t
you? C’mon, everyone’s got coffee! Spill the beans!’

They stared at the crossbow and slowly shook their heads.

‘What about you, writer man?’ snarled Maladict. ‘Where’re you hiding the
coffee?’

‘We only have cocoa,’ said the writer, raising his hands quickly as
Maladict turned on him. ‘You’re welcome to—’

Maladict dropped his crossbow, which fired straight up into the air⁷,
and sat down with his head in his hands. ‘We’re all gonna _die_,’ he
said. The troopers shifted as though to stand up, and Jade raised her
sapling.

‘Don’t even _fink_ about it,’ she said.

Polly turned to the writer man. ‘You want us to talk to you, sir? Then
_you_ talk to us. Is this about . . . Prince Heinrich’s . . . socks?’

Maladict stood up in one mad movement. ‘I say we grease the lot of them
and go home!’ he said, to no one in particular. ‘One, Two, Three! What
We Are Fighting For!’

‘Socks?’ said the writer, looking nervously at the vampire. ‘What’ve
socks got to do with it?’

‘I just gave you an _order_, Polly,’ said Maladict.

‘What is it you think we don’t know?’ Polly insisted, glaring at de
Worde.

‘Well, to start with you’re just about all that’s left of the
Ins-and-Outs—’

‘_That’s not true!_’

‘Oh, there’s prisoners and wounded, I think. But why should I lie to
you? Why did he call you Polly?’

‘Because I know a lot about birds,’ said Polly, mentally cursing. ‘How
do you _know_ what’s been happening to the regiment?’

‘Because it’s my job to know things,’ said the man. ‘What’s that bird up
there?’

Polly glanced up. ‘I don’t have time for stupid games,’ she said. ‘And
that’s a—’ She stopped. Something was wheeling high above, in the
forbidden blue.

‘You don’t know?’ said de Worde.

‘Yes, of course I know,’ said Polly irritably. ‘It’s a white-necked
buzzard. But I thought they never came this far into the mountains. I
only ever saw one in a book—’ She raised her bow again, and tried to
take control. ‘Am I right, Mr It’s-my-job-to-know-things?’

De Worde raised his hands again and gave her a sickly smile. ‘Probably,’
he said. ‘I live in a city. I know sparrows from starlings. After that
everything’s a duck as far as I’m concerned.’

Polly glared at him.

‘Look, please,’ said the man. ‘You need to listen to me. You need to
know things. Before it’s too late.’

Polly lowered the bow. ‘If you want to talk to us, wait here,’ she said.
‘Corporal, we are leaving. Carborundum, pick up those troopers!’

‘Hold it,’ said Maladict. ‘Who’s the corporal in this squad?’

‘You are,’ said Polly. ‘And you’re drooling, and swaying, and your eyes
look weird. So what was your point, please?’

Maladict considered this. Polly was tired and frightened and somewhere
inside this was all being transmuted into anger. Hers was not an
expression you wanted to see at the far end of a crossbow. An arrow
couldn’t kill a vampire, but that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt.

‘Right, yeah,’ he said. ‘Carborundum, pick up those troopers! We are
leaving!’

There was a bird whistle as Polly neared the hiding place. She
identified this one as the sound of the Very Bad Bird Impersonator, and
made a note to teach the girls some bird calls that at least sounded
real. They were harder to do than most people thought.

The squad were in the gully, armed and at least _looking_ dangerous.
There was a certain amount of relaxation when they saw Jade carrying the
two bound troopers. Two more were sitting disconsolately against the
cliff, hands tied behind them.

Maladict walked smartly up to Blouse and saluted. ‘Two prisoners,
el-tee, and Perks thinks there’s someone down there you ought to talk
to.’ He leaned forward. ‘The newspaper man, sir.’

‘Then we’ll jolly well keep _well_ away from him,’ said Blouse. ‘Eh,
sergeant?’

‘Right, sir!’ said Jackrum. ‘Nothing but trouble, sir!’

Polly saluted madly. ‘Please, sir! Permission to speak, sir!’

‘Yes, Perks?’ said Blouse.

Polly saw there was one chance, and one only. She _had_ to find out
about Paul. Now her mind worked as fast as it had on the hill last
night, when she’d gone for the man with the code book.

‘Sir, I don’t know if he’s worth talking to, sir, but he may be worth
listening to. Even if you think he’ll only tell us lies. Because
sometimes, sir, the way people tell you lies, if they tell you _enough_
lies, well, they sort of . . . show you what shape the truth is, sir.
And we don’t have to tell _him_ the truth, sir. We could lie to him,
too.’

‘I am not by nature an untruthful man, Perks,’ said Blouse coldly.

‘Glad to hear it, sir. Are we winning the war, sir?’

‘You stop that right now, Perks!’ Jackrum roared.

‘It was only a question, sarge,’ said Polly reproachfully.

Around the clearing the squad waited, ears sucking up every sound.
Everyone knew the answer. They waited for it to be said aloud.

‘Perks, this kind of talk spreads despondency,’ Blouse began, but he
said it as if he didn’t believe it and didn’t care who knew.

‘No, sir. It doesn’t really. It’s better than being lied to,’ said
Polly. She changed her voice, gave it that edge her mother used to use
on her when she was being scolded. ‘It’s evil to lie. No one likes a
liar. Tell me the truth, please.’

Some harmonic of that tone must have found a home in an old part of
Blouse’s brain. As Jackrum opened his mouth to roar, the lieutenant held
up a hand.

‘We are not winning, Perks. But we have not lost yet.’

‘I think we all know that, sir, but it’s good to hear you say it,’ said
Polly, giving him an encouraging smile.

That seemed to work, too. ‘I suppose there is no harm in at least being
civil to the wretched fellow,’ said Blouse, as if thinking aloud. ‘He
may give away valuable information under cunning questioning.’

Polly looked at Sergeant Jackrum, who was staring upwards like a man in
prayer.

‘Permission to be the man to interrogate the gentleman, sir,’ said the
sergeant.

‘Permission denied, sergeant,’ said Blouse. ‘I’d like him to live and
don’t want to lose another lobe. However, you may take Perks back to the
cart and drive it up here.’

Jackrum gave him the smart salute. Polly had already learned to
recognize it; it meant that Jackrum had already made _plans_.

‘Very good, sir,’ he said. ‘Come on, Perks.’

Jackrum was quiet as they walked back down over the needle-carpeted
slope. Then, after a while, he said: ‘D’you know why them troopers found
our little nook, Perks?’

‘No, sarge.’

‘The lieutenant ordered Shufti to put the fire out immediately. It
wasn’t as if there was even any smoke. So Shufti goes and pours the
kettle on it.’

Polly gave this a few seconds’ thought. ‘Steam, sarge?’

‘Right! In a bloody great rising cloud. Not Shufti’s fault. The
gallopers weren’t any trouble, though. Bright enough not to try to
outrun half a dozen crossbows, at least. That’s clever for a
cavalryman.’

‘Well done, sarge.’

‘Don’t talk to me as if I was a rupert, lad,’ said Jackrum easily.

‘Sorry, sarge.’

‘I see you’re learnin’ how to steer an officer, though. You gotta make
sure they gives you the right orders, see? You’ll make a good sergeant,
Perks.’

‘Don’t want to, sarge.’

‘Yeah, right,’ said Jackrum. It could have meant anything.

After watching the track for a minute or two they stepped out and headed
towards the cart. De Worde was sitting on a stool beside it, writing in
a notebook, but he stood up hurriedly when he saw them.

‘It’d be a good idea to get off the track,’ he said, as soon as they
approached. ‘There are a lot of patrols, I understand.’

‘Zlobenian patrols, sir?’ said Jackrum.

‘Yes. In theory this’ – he pointed to the flag that hung limply from the
cart – ‘should keep us safe, but everyone’s a bit jumpy at the moment.
Aren’t you Sergeant Jack Ram?’

‘Jackrum, sir. And I’ll thank you for not writing my name down in your
little book, sir.’

‘Sorry, sergeant, but that’s my job,’ said de Worde breezily. ‘I have to
write things down.’

‘Well, sir, soldierin’ is _my_ job,’ said Jackrum, climbing on to the
cart and gathering up the reins. ‘But you’ll note how at this moment in
time I am not killin’ you. Let’s go, eh?’

Polly climbed into the back of the cart as it lumbered off. It was full
of boxes and equipment, and while it might once have been neatly
organized, that organization was now but a distant memory, a clear
indication that this cart was the property of a man. Next to her, half a
dozen of the largest pigeons she had ever seen dozed on a perch in their
wire cage, and she wondered if they were a living larder. One of them
opened one eye and lazily went ‘Lollollop?’ which is pigeon for ‘Duh?’

Most of the rest of the boxes had labels like – she leaned closer –
‘Capt Horace Calumney’s Patent Field Biscuits’, and ‘Dried Stew’. As she
was musing that Shufti would have very much liked to get her hands on
one or two of those boxes, a bundle of clothes hanging from the ceiling
of the rocking cart moved slightly and a face appeared.

‘Good mornink,’ it said, upside down.

William de Worde turned round on the seat in front. ‘It’s only Otto,
private,’ he said. ‘Don’t be afraid.’

‘Yes, I vill not bite,’ said the face cheerfully. It smiled. A vampire’s
face does not look any better upside down, and a smile in these
circumstances does nothing to improve matters. ‘That is _guaranteed_.’

Polly lowered the crossbow. Jackrum would have been impressed by how
quickly she had raised it. So was she, and embarrassed too. The socks
were doing the thinking again.

Otto very elegantly lowered himself to the bed of the cart. ‘Vhere are
ve goink?’ he said, steadying himself as they bounced over a rut.

‘A little place I know, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Nice and quiet.’

‘Good. I need to exercise the imps. Zey get fretful if zey are cooped up
for too long.’ Otto pushed aside a stack of paper and revealed his large
picture-making box. He lifted a small hatch.

‘Rise und shine, lads,’ he said. There was a chorus of high-pitched
voices from inside.

‘I’d better just mark your card re Tiger, Mr de Worde,’ said Jackrum, as
the cart rolled up an old logging track.

‘Tiger? Who’s Tiger?’

‘Oops,’ said Jackrum. ‘Sorry, that’s what we call the lieutenant, sir,
on account of him being so brave. Forget I said that, will you?’

‘Brave, is he?’ said de Worde.

‘And clever, sir. Don’t let him fool you, sir. He is one of the great
milit’ry minds of his generation, sir.’

Polly’s mouth dropped open. She had suggested they lied to the man, but
. . . _this_?

‘Really? Then why is he just a lieutenant?’ said the writer.

‘Ah, I can see there’s no fooling you, sir,’ said Jackrum, oozing
knowingness. ‘Yes, it’s a puzzler, sir, why he calls himself a
lieutenant. Still, I dare say he has his reasons, eh? Just like Heinrich
calling himself a captain, right?’ He tapped the side of his nose. ‘I
see everything, sir, and I don’t say a word!’

‘All I could find out was that he did some kind of desk job at your HQ,
sergeant,’ said de Worde. Polly saw him taking his notebook out, slowly
and carefully.

‘Yes, I expect that’s what you would find out, sir,’ said Jackrum, with
a huge conspiratorial wink. ‘And then, when things are at their worst,
they let him out, sir. They _unleash_ him, sir. Me, I don’t know a
thing, sir.’

‘What does he do, explode?’ said de Worde.

‘Haha, nice one, sir!’ said Jackrum. ‘No, sir. What he does, sir, is
_assess situations_, sir. I don’t understand it myself, sir, not being a
big thinker, but the proof of the pudding, sir, is in the eating of
same, and last night we were jumped by eight— twenty Zlobenian troopers,
sir, and the lieutenant just assessed the situation in a flash and
skewered five of the buggers, sir. Like a kebab, sir. Mild as milk to
look at, but rouse him and he’s a whirlwind of death. Of course, you did
not hear it from me, sir.’

‘And he’s in charge of a bunch of recruits, sergeant?’ said de Worde.
‘That doesn’t sound very likely to me.’

‘Recruits who captured some crack cavalrymen, sir,’ said Jackrum,
looking pained. ‘That’s leadership for you. Comes the hour, comes the
man, sir. I’m just a simple old soldier, sir, seen ’em come and seen ’em
go. Upon my oath I am not a lying man, sir, but I look at Lieutenant
Blouse in wonderment.’

‘He just seemed confused, to me,’ said de Worde, but there was a hint of
uncertainty in his voice.

‘That was a bit of concussion, sir. He took a wallop that would have
felled a lesser man, and still got back on to his feet. Amazing, sir!’

‘Hmm,’ said de Worde, making a note.

The cart splashed across the shallow little stream and rocked into the
gully. Lieutenant Blouse was sitting on a rock. He’d made an effort, but
his tunic was grubby, his boots were muddy, his hand was swollen and one
ear, despite Igorina’s ministrations, was still inflamed. He had his
sword on his knees. Jackrum carefully brought the cart to a halt by a
thicket of birch trees. All four of the enemy troopers were tied up
against the cliff. Apart from them, the camp appeared to be deserted.

‘Where are the rest of the men, sergeant?’ whispered de Worde, as he
slid down off the cart.

‘Oh, they’re around, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Watching you. Probably not a
good idea to make any sudden move, sir.’

No one else was visible . . . and then Maladict faded into view.

People never really looked at things, Polly knew. They _glanced_. And
what had been a patch of scrub was now Corporal Maladict. Polly stared.
He’d cut a hole in the centre of his old blanket, and the mud and grass
stains on the mildewed greyness had turned him into part of the
landscape until he’d saluted. He’d also stuck leafy twigs all over his
hat.

Sergeant Jackrum goggled. Polly had never really seen proper goggling
before, but the sergeant had the face to do it at championship level.
She could feel him drawing breath while at the same time assembling
cusswords for a right royal thundering – and then he remembered he was
playing Sergeant Big Jolly Fat Man, and this was not the time to segue
into Sergeant Incandescent.

‘Lads, eh?’ he chuckled to de Worde. ‘What will they think of next?’

De Worde nodded nervously, pulled a wad of newspapers from under his
seat, and advanced on the lieutenant.

‘Mr de Worde, isn’t it?’ said Blouse, standing up. ‘Perks, can we manage
a cup of, er, “saloop” for Mr de Worde? There’s a good chap. Do take a
rock, sir.’

‘Good of you to see me, lieutenant,’ said de Worde. ‘It looks as though
you’ve been in the wars!’ he added, with an attempt at joviality.

‘No, only this one,’ said Blouse, looking puzzled.

‘I meant that you have been wounded, sir,’ said de Worde.

‘These? Oh, they’re nothing, sir. I’m afraid the one on my hand was
self-inflicted. Sword drill, you know.’

‘You’re left-handed then, sir?’

‘Oh, no.’

Polly, washing out a mug, heard Jackrum say out of the corner of his
mouth: ‘Should’ve seen the other two fellows, sir!’

‘Are you aware of the progress of the war, lieutenant?’ said de Worde.

‘You tell me, sir,’ said Blouse.

‘All your army is bottled up in the Kneck valley. Dug in, mostly, just
beyond the reach of the keep’s weaponry. Your forts elsewhere along the
border have been captured. The garrisons at Drerp and Glitz and Arblatt
have been overwhelmed. As far as I can tell, lieutenant, your squad are
the only soldiers still at large. At least,’ he added, ‘the only ones
still fighting.’

‘And my regiment?’ said Blouse quietly.

‘The remnant of the Tenth took part in a brave but, frankly, suicidal
attempt to retake Kneck Keep a few days ago, sir. Most of the survivors
are prisoners of war, and I have to tell you that almost all your high
command have been captured. They were in the keep when it was taken.
There are big dungeons in that fort, sir, and they’re pretty full.’

‘Why should I believe you?’

_I do_, thought Polly. So Paul is either dead, wounded or captured. And
it doesn’t help much by thinking of it as two chances in three that he
is alive.

De Worde threw his newspapers at the lieutenant’s feet. ‘It’s all there,
sir. I didn’t make it up. It’s the truth. It will remain true whether
you believe it or not. There are more than six countries ranged against
you, including Genua and Mouldavia and Ankh-Morpork. There is no one on
your side. You are alone. The only reason you’re not beaten yet is
because you won’t admit it. I’ve seen your generals, sir! Great leaders,
and your men fight like demons, but they won’t surrender!’

‘Borogravia doesn’t know the meaning of the word “surrender”, Mr de
Worde,’ said the lieutenant.

‘Can I lend you a dictionary, sir?’ snapped de Worde, going red in the
face. ‘It’s very similar to the meaning of “making some kind of peace
while you’ve got a chance”, sir! It’s rather like “quitting while you’ve
still got a head”, sir! Good heavens, sir, don’t you understand? The
reason that there still _is_ an army in the Kneck valley is that the
allies haven’t decided what to do with it! They’re fed up with the
slaughter!’

‘Ah, so we still fight back!’ said Blouse.

De Worde sighed. ‘You don’t understand, sir. They are fed up with
slaughtering _you_. They’ve got the keep now. There’s some big war
engines up there. They . . . frankly, sir, some of the alliance would
just as soon wipe out the remains of your army. It’d be like shooting
rats in a barrel. They have you at their mercy. And yet you keep on
attacking. You attack the keep! It’s on sheer rock and it’s got walls a
hundred feet high. You make salients across the river. You’re bottled up
and you’ve got nowhere to go and the allies could simply massacre you
any time they want, and you act as though you’re just facing some kind
of temporary setback. That’s what’s really happening, lieutenant! _You_
are just a last little detail.’

‘Have a care, please,’ Blouse warned.

‘Excuse me, sir, but do you know _anything_ about recent history? In the
past thirty years you have declared war on every single one of your
neighbours at least once. All countries fight, but _you_ brawl. And then
last year you invaded Zlobenia _again_!’

‘They invaded us, Mr de Worde.’

‘You have been misinformed, lieutenant. You invaded the Kneck province.’

‘That was confirmed as Borogravian by the Treaty of Lint, more than a
hundred years ago.’

‘Signed at swordpoint, sir. And no one cares now, in any case. It’s all
got beyond your stupid little royal scuffles. Because your men tore down
the Grand Trunk, you see. The clacks towers. _And_ tore up the coach
road. Ankh-Morpork regards that as bandit activity.’

‘Have a care, I said!’ said Blouse. ‘I note you are displaying the
Ankh-Morpork flag with evident pride on your wagon.’

‘_Civis Morporkias sum_, sir. I am an Ankh-Morpork citizen. You could
say that Ankh-Morpork shelters me under her wide and rather greasy wing,
although I agree the metaphor could use some work.’

‘Your Ankh-Morpork soldiers aren’t in a position to protect you,
however.’

‘Sir, you are right. You could have me killed right now,’ said de Worde
simply. ‘You know that. I know that. But you won’t, for three reasons.
The officers of Borogravia tend towards honour. Everyone says that.
That’s why they don’t surrender. And I bleed most distressingly. And you
don’t need to, because everyone is interested in you. Suddenly, it’s all
changed.’

‘_Interested_ in us?’

‘Sir, in a sense you could help a lot right now. Apparently people back
in Ankh-Morpork were amazed when . . . look, have you heard about what
we call “human interest”, sir?’

‘No.’

De Worde tried to explain. Blouse listened with his mouth open and, at
the end, said: ‘Have I got this right? Although many people have been
killed and wounded in this wretched war, it’s not been of much
“interest” to your readers? But it is now, just because of us? Because
of a little skirmish in a town they’ve never heard of? And because of
it, we’re suddenly a “plucky little country” and people are telling your
newspaper that your great city should be on _our_ side?’

‘Yes, lieutenant. We put out a second edition last night, you see. After
I’d found out that “Captain Horentz” was really Prince Heinrich. Did you
know this at the time, sir?’

‘Of course not!’ snapped Blouse.

‘And you, Private, er, Perks, would you have kicked him in the . . .
would you have kicked him had you known?’

Polly dropped a mug in her nervousness, and looked at Blouse.

‘You may answer, of course, Perks,’ said the lieutenant.

‘Well, yes, sir. I would have kicked him. Harder, probably. I was
defending myself, sir,’ Polly said, carefully avoiding further details.
You couldn’t be sure what someone like de Worde would do with them.

‘Right, good, yes,’ said de Worde. ‘Then you might be pleased with this.
Our cartoonist Fizz drew this for the special edition. It was on the
front page. We’ve sold a record number of copies.’ He handed her a
flimsy piece of paper, which by the look of the creases had been folded
many times.

It was a line drawing, with lots of shading. It showed a huge figure,
with a large sword, a monstrous monocle and a moustache as wide as a
coathanger, menacing a much smaller figure armed with nothing more than
an instrument for lifting beets – in fact there was a beet stuck on the
end of it. At least, that was clearly what _had_ been happening right up
to the point when the smaller figure, wearing a not bad attempt at an
Ins-and-Outs shako and a face that looked slightly like Polly’s, had
kicked the other one squarely in the groinal regions. A sort of balloon
was coming out of Polly’s mouth, containing the words: ‘_That for your
Royal Prerogative, you Blaggard!_’ The balloon issuing from the mouth of
the ogre, who could only be Prince Heinrich, said: ‘_Oh my Succession!
That such A Small Thing could hurt so Much!_’ And in the background a
fat woman in a rumpled ballgown and a huge old-fashioned helmet was
clasping her hands to an unbelievably large bosom, staring at the fight
with a mixture of concern and admiration, and ballooning: ‘_Oh my Swain!
I fear our Liaison is Cut short!_’

Since no one else was saying much, but was simply staring, de Worde
said, rather nervously: ‘Fizz is rather, er, direct in these matters,
but amazingly popular. Ahem. You see, the curious thing is that although
Ankh-Morpork is probably the biggest bully around, in a subtle kind of
way, we nevertheless have a soft spot for people who stand up to
bullies. Especially royal ones. We tend to be on their side, provided it
doesn’t cost us too much.’

Blouse cleared his throat. ‘It’s quite a good likeness of you, Perks,’
he said hoarsely.

‘I only used my knee, sir!’ Polly protested. ‘And that fat lady
certainly wasn’t there!’

‘That’s Morporkia,’ said de Worde. ‘She’s a sort of representation of
the city, except that in her case she’s not covered in mud and soot.’

‘And I have to add, for my part,’ said Blouse, in his
talking-to-a-meeting voice, ‘that Borogravia is in fact larger than
Zlobenia, although most of the country is little more than barren
mountainside—’

‘That doesn’t actually matter,’ said de Worde.

‘It doesn’t?’ said Blouse.

‘No, sir. It’s just a fact. It’s not politics. In politics, sir,
pictures like this are powerful. Sir, even the alliance commanders are
talking about you, and the Zlobenians are angry and bewildered. If you,
the heroes of the hour, could make a plea for a little common sense—’

The lieutenant took a long, deep breath. ‘This is a foolish war, Mr de
Worde. But I am a soldier. I have “kissed the Duchess”, as we say. It’s
an oath of loyalty. Don’t tempt me to break it. I must fight for my
country. We will repel all invaders. If there are deserters, we will
find them and rally them again. We know the country. While we are free,
Borogravia will be free. You have “had your say”. Thank you. Where is
that tea, Perks?’

‘What? Oh, nearly done, sir!’ said Polly, turning back to the fire.

It had been a sudden strange fancy, but a stupid plan. Now, out here,
all the drawbacks were visible. How would she have got Paul home? Would
he have wanted to come? Could she have managed it? Even if he was still
alive, how could she hope to get him out of a prison?

‘So you’ll be guerilla fighters, eh?’ said Mr de Worde, behind her.
‘Madmen, all of you.’

‘No, we are not irregulars,’ said Blouse. ‘We kissed the Duchess. We are
_soldiers_.’

‘Oh, well,’ said de Worde. ‘Then I admire your spirit, at least. Ah,
Otto . . .’

The vampire iconographer ambled up, and gave them a shy smile. ‘Do not
be afraid. I am a Black Ribboner just like your corporal,’ he said.
‘Light is my passion now.’

‘Oh? Er . . . well done,’ said Blouse.

‘Take the pictures, Otto,’ said de Worde. ‘These gentlemen have a war to
fight.’

‘Out of interest, Mr de Worde,’ Blouse interrupted, ‘how did you get the
pictures back to your city so quickly? Magic, I assume?’

‘What?’ De Worde looked momentarily off balance. ‘Oh no, sir. Wizards
are expensive and Commander Vimes has said that there is going to be no
first use of magic in this war. We send things by pigeon to our office
in the keep and then by clacks from the nearest trunk tower.’

‘Oh, really?’ said Blouse, showing rather more animation than Polly had
seen up until now. ‘Using numbers to indicate a scale of grey shades,
perhaps?’

‘Mein Gotts!’ said Otto.

‘Well, yes, as a matter of fact we do,’ said de Worde. ‘I’m very
impressed that you—’

‘I have seen the clacks towers on the far bank of the Kneck,’ said
Blouse, his eyes lighting up. ‘Very clever idea, using big shuttered
boxes rather than the old-fashioned semaphore arms. And would I be right
in my surmise that the box on the top, which opens its shutters once a
second, is a kind of system, er, clock that makes certain the whole
clacks line keeps in step? Oh, good. I thought so. One beat a second is
probably the limit of the mechanisms, so no doubt all your efforts now
are concentrated on maximizing the information content per shutter
operation? Yes, I imagined that would be the case. As for sending
pictures, well, sooner or later all things are numbers, yes? Of course,
you would use each of the two columns of four boxes to send a grey code,
but it must be very slow. Have you considered a squeezing algorithm?’

De Worde and Chriek exchanged a glance. ‘Are you sure you haven’t been
talking to anyone about this, sir?’ said the writer.

‘Oh, it’s all very elementary,’ said Blouse, smiling happily. ‘I had
thought about it in the context of military maps which are, of course,
mostly white space. So I wondered if it would be possible to indicate a
required shade on one column and, on the other side, indicate how far
along that rank that shade would persist. And a delightful bonus here is
that if your map is simply in black and white, then you have even more—’

‘You haven’t seen inside a clacks tower, have you?’ said de Worde.

‘Alas, no,’ said Blouse. ‘This is simply “thinking aloud” based on the
_de facto_ existence of your picture. I believe I can see a number of
other little mathematical, ahem, tricks to make the passage of
information even swifter, but I am sure these have already occurred to
you. Of course, a fairly minor modification could potentially double the
information burden of the whole system at a stroke. And that is without
using coloured filters at night, which I’m sure even with the overhead
of extra mechanical effort would surely increase throughput by— I’m
sorry, did I say something wrong?’

The two men both wore a glazed expression. De Worde shook himself. ‘Oh
. . . er, no. Nothing,’ he said. ‘Er . . . you seem to have got the
grasp of things quite . . . quickly.’

‘Oh, it was perfectly straightforward once I started thinking about it,’
said Blouse. ‘It was exactly the same when I had to redesign the
department’s filing system, you see. People build something that works.
Then circumstances change, and they have to tinker with it to make it
continue to work, and they are so busy tinkering that they cannot see
that a much better idea would be to build a whole new system to deal
with the new circumstances. But to an outsider, the idea is obvious.’

‘In politics as well as, er, filing systems and clackses, do you think?’
said de Worde.

Blouse’s brow wrinkled. ‘I’m sorry, I don’t think I follow . . .’ he
said.

‘Would you agree that sometimes a country’s system is so out of date
that it’s only the outsiders that can see the need for wholesale
change?’ said de Worde. He smiled. Lieutenant Blouse did not.

‘Just a point to ponder, maybe,’ said de Worde. ‘Er . . . since you wish
to tell the world of your defiance, would you object if my colleague
takes your picture?’

Blouse shrugged. ‘If it gives you any satisfaction,’ he said. ‘It’s an
Abomination, of course, but these days it’s hard to find something that
isn’t. You must tell the world, Mr de Worde, that Borogravia won’t lie
down. We will not give in. We will fight on. Write that down in your
little notebook, please. While we can stand, we will kick!’

‘Yes, but once again may I implore you to—’

‘Mr de Worde, you have I am sure heard the saying that the pen is
mightier than the sword?’

De Worde preened a little. ‘Of course, and I—’

‘Do you want to test it? Take your picture, sir, and then my men will
escort you back to your road.’

Otto Chriek stood up and bowed to Blouse. He unslung his picture box.

‘This vill only take vun minute,’ he said.

It never does. Polly watched in horrified fascination as Otto took
picture after picture of Lieutenant Blouse in a variety of what the
lieutenant thought were heroic poses. It is a terrible thing to see a
man trying to jut out a chin he does not, in fact, have.

‘Very impressive,’ said de Worde. ‘I just hope you live to see it in my
paper, sir.’

‘I shall look forward to it with the keenest anticipation,’ said Blouse.
‘And now, Perks, please go along with the sergeant and put these two
gentlemen back on their way.’

Otto sidled up to Polly as they walked back to the cart. ‘I need to tell
you somezing about your vampire,’ he said.

‘Oh, yes?’

‘You are a friend of his?’ said Otto.

‘Yes,’ said Polly. ‘Is something wrong?’

‘Zere is a problem . . .’

‘He’s got twitchy because he has run out of coffee?’

‘Alas, if only it vas that simple.’ Otto looked awkward. ‘You have to
understand that ven a vampire forgoes . . . the b-vord, there is a
process that ve call transference? Ve force ourselves to desire
something _else_? For me this vas not painful. I crave the perfection of
light and shade. Pictures are my life! But your friend chose . . .
coffee. And now he has none.’

‘Oh. I see.’

‘I vunder if you do. It probably seemed so sensible to him. It is a
human craving, and no one minds if you say, as it might be, “I am dying
for a cup of coffee”, or “I’d kill for a cup of coffee”. But without
coffee, he vill, I am afraid . . . revert. You understand, this is very
difficult for me to talk about . . .’ Otto trailed off.

‘By revert you mean . . . ?’

‘First vill come mild delusions, I think. A psychic susceptibility to
all kinds of influences from who knows vhere, and vampires can
hallucinate so stronkly zat zey can be contagious. I zink zat is
happening already. He vill become . . . erratic. This may last for
several days. And then his conditioning vill break and he vill be, vunce
again, a true vampire. No more Mr Nice Coffee Drinker Guy.’

‘Can’t I do anything to help him?’

Otto reverentially laid his picture box in the back of the cart, and
turned to her. ‘You can find him some coffee, or . . . you can keep a
vooden stake and a big knife ready. You vould be doink him a favour,
believe me.’

‘I can’t do that!’

Otto shrugged. ‘Find someone who vill.’

‘He is amazing!’ said de Worde, as the cart rocked back down through the
trees. ‘I know the clacks is against your religion, but he seems to
understand all about it.’

‘Like I said, sir, he _assesses_ stuff,’ said Jackrum, beaming. ‘Mind
like a razor.’

‘He was talking about clacks algorithms that the companies are only just
now investigating,’ said de Worde. ‘That department he was talking
about—’

‘Ah, I can see nothing gets past you, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Very
hush-hush. Can’t talk about it.’

‘To be frank, sergeant, I’d always assumed that Borogravia was, well
. . . backward.’

Jackrum’s smile was waxy and bright. ‘If we seem to be a long way back,
sir, it’s only so’s we can get a good run-up.’

‘You know, sergeant, it’s a great shame to see a mind like that wasted,’
said de Worde, as the cart lurched in a rut. ‘This is not an age of
heroes and famous last stands and death-or-glory charges. Do your men a
favour and try to tell him that, will you?’

‘Wouldn’t dream of it, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Here is your road, sir.
Where will you be heading now?’

‘To the Kneck valley, sergeant. This is a good story, sergeant. Thank
you. Allow me to shake you by the hand.’

‘Glad to hear you think that, sir,’ said Jackrum, extending his hand.
Polly heard the faint clink of coins in their passage from palm to palm.
De Worde took the reins.

‘But I must tell you, sergeant, that we’ll probably send off our stuff
by pigeon within the hour,’ he said. ‘We will have to say you have
prisoners.’

‘Don’t worry about that, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘By the time their mates
come out here to rescue those gallopers, we’ll be halfway back to the
mountains. Our mountains.’

They parted. Jackrum watched them out of sight, and turned to Polly.

‘Him with his airs and graces,’ he said. ‘Did you see that? He insulted
me by giving me a tip!’ He glanced at his palm. ‘Hmm, five Morpork
dollars? Well, at least he’s a man who knows how to insult you
handsomely,’ he added, and the coins disappeared into his jacket with
remarkable speed.

‘I think he wants to help us, sarge,’ said Polly.

Jackrum ignored that. ‘I hate bloody Ankh-Morpork,’ he said. ‘Who’re
they to tell us what to do? Who cares what they think?’

‘Do you think we can really join up with deserters, sarge?’

‘Nope. They deserted once, what’s to stop ’em a second time? They spat
on the Duchess when they deserted, they can’t kiss and make up now. You
get one kiss, that’s all.’

‘But Lieutenant Blouse—’

‘The rupert should stick to sums. He thinks he’s a soldier. Never walked
on a battlefield in his life. All that rubbish he gave your man was
death-or-glory stuff. And I’ll tell you, Perks, I’ve seen Death more
often than I care to remember, but I’ve never clapped eyes on Glory. I’m
all for sending the fools to look for us where we ain’t, though.’

‘He’s not _my_ man, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, well, you’re at home with the writin’ and readin’,’ grumbled
Jackrum. ‘You can’t trust the people who do that stuff. They mess around
with the world, and it turns out everything you know is wrong.’

They reached the gully again. The squad had come back from their various
hiding places, and most were clustered around one of the newspapers. For
the first time, Polly saw the Picture.

It was actually quite good, especially of Shufti and Wazzer. _She_ was
mostly hidden by the bulk of Jackrum. But you could see the sullen
cavalrymen behind them, and their expressions were a picture in
themselves.

‘It’s a good one of Tonker,’ said Igorina, who didn’t lisp so much when
there were no officers to hear.

‘Do you think having a picture like this is an Abomination in the Eyes
of Nuggan?’ said Shufti nervously.

‘Probably,’ said Polly absent-mindedly. ‘Most things are.’ She ran her
eye down the text next to the picture. It was full of phrases like
‘plucky farm boys’ and ‘humiliation of some of Zlobenia’s best troops’
and ‘sting in the tail’. She could see why it had caused trouble.

She rustled through the other pages. They were crammed with strange
stories about places she’d never heard of, and pictures of people she
didn’t recognize. But one page was a mass of grey text, under a line of
much bigger printing which read:

WHY THIS MAD STATE MUST
Be Stopped

Bewildered, her eye picked up phrases from the sea of letters:
‘disgraceful invasions of neighbouring states’, ‘deluded worshippers of
a mad god’, ‘a strutting bully’, ‘outrage after outrage’, ‘flying in the
face of international opinion’ . . .

‘Don’t you lads read that rubbish, you don’t know where it’s been,’ said
Sergeant Jackrum jovially, arriving behind them. ‘It’ll all be lies. We
are leaving right— Corporal Maladict!’

Maladict, emerging from the trees, gave a lazy salute. He was still
wearing his blanket.

‘What _are_ you doing out of uniform?’

‘I’m in uniform underneath, sarge. We don’t want to be seen, right? Like
this, we become part of the jungle.’

‘It’s a forest, corporal! And without bloody uniforms, how the hell will
we know our friends from our enemies?’

Maladict lit a cigarette before he replied. ‘The way I see it, sarge,’
he said, ‘the enemy is everyone but us.’

‘Just one moment, sergeant,’ said Blouse, who had looked up from a
newspaper and had been watching the apparition with considerable
interest. ‘There are precedents in antiquity, you know. General Song
Sung Lo moved his army disguised as a field of sunflowers, and General
Tacticus once commanded a battalion to dress as spruces.’

‘_Sunflowers?_’ said Jackrum, his voice oozing with disdain.

‘Both actions were successful, sergeant.’

‘No uniforms? No badges? No _stripes_, sir?’

‘Possibly you could be an extra large bloom?’ said Blouse, and his face
betrayed no hint of amusement. ‘And you have surely carried out actions
at night, when all markings are invisible?’

‘Yessir, but night is night, sir, while sunflowers is . . . is
_sunflowers_, sir! I’ve worn this uniform for more’n fift— all my life,
sir, and sneaking around without a uniform is downright dishonourable!
It’s for spies, sir!’ Jackrum’s face had gone beyond red into crimson,
and Polly was amazed to see tears in the corners of his eyes.

‘How can we be spies, sergeant, in our own country?’ said Blouse calmly.

‘The el-tee’s got a point, sarge,’ said Maladict.

Jackrum turned like a bull at bay, and then to Polly’s amazement he
sagged. But she wasn’t amazed for long. She knew the man. She didn’t
know why, but there was something about Jackrum that she could read. It
was in the eyes. He could lie with eyes as honest and tranquil as those
of an angel. And if he appeared to be backing away, it was indeed only
to get a run-up later on.

‘All right, all right,’ the sergeant said. ‘Upon my oath, I am not a man
to disobey orders.’ And the eyes twinkled.

‘Well done, sergeant,’ said Blouse.

Jackrum pulled himself together. ‘I don’t want to be a sunflower,
though,’ he said.

‘Happily there are only fir trees in this area, sergeant.’

‘Point well made, sir.’ Jackrum turned to the awed squad. ‘All right,
Last Detail,’ he bellowed. ‘You heard the man! Spruce up!’

It was an hour later. As far as Polly could tell, they’d started out for
the mountains but had travelled in a wide semi-circle so that they ended
up facing back the way they had come, but a few miles away. Was Blouse
leading, or had he left it to Jackrum? Neither man was complaining.

The lieutenant called a halt in a thicket of birch, thus doubling the
size of the thicket. You could say that the camouflage effects were
effective, because bright red and white shows up against greens and
greys. Beyond that, though, language tended to run out.

Jade had scraped off her paint, and was green and grey anyway. Igorina
looked like a walking brush. Wazzer quivered like an aspen all the time,
so her leaves rustled permanently. The others had made more or less
reasonable attempts, and Polly was pretty proud of her own efforts.
Jackrum was about as treelike as a big red rubber ball; Polly suspected
that he’d surreptitiously shined up his brasswork, too. Every tree held
a mug of tea in limb or hand. After all, they’d stopped for five
minutes.

‘Men,’ said Blouse, as if he’d only just reached that conclusion. ‘You
may have gathered that we are heading back towards the mountains to
raise a deserters’ army there. This story is, in fact, a _ruse_ for the
benefit of Mr de Worde!’ He paused, as if expecting some reaction. They
stared at him. He went on: ‘We are, in fact, continuing our journey to
the Kneck valley. This is the last thing the enemy will be expecting.’

Polly glanced at the sergeant. He was grinning.

‘It is an established fact that a small, light force can get into places
that a battalion cannot penetrate,’ Blouse went on. ‘Men, we will be
that force! Is that not right, Sergeant Jackrum?’

‘Yessir!’

‘We will come down like a hammer on those forces smaller than us,’ said
Blouse happily.

‘Yessir!’

‘And from those that outnumber us, we will merge silently into the
forest—’

‘Yessir!’

‘We will slip past their sentries—’

‘That’s right, sir,’ said Jackrum.

‘—and take Kneck Keep from under their noses!’

Jackrum’s tea sprayed across the clearing.

‘I dare say our enemy feels impregnable just because he commands a
heavily armed fort on a rocky crag with walls a hundred feet high and
twenty feet thick,’ Blouse continued, as if half the trees weren’t now
dripping tea. ‘But he is in for a surprise!’

‘You all right, sarge?’ whispered Polly. Jackrum was making strange
little noises in his throat.

‘Does anyone have any questions?’ said Blouse.

Igorina raised a branch. ‘How will we get in, sir?’ she said.

‘Ah. Good question,’ said Blouse. ‘And all will become apparent in due
time.’

‘Aerial cavalry,’ said Maladict.

‘Pardon, corporal?’

‘Flying machines, sir!’ said Maladict. ‘They won’t know where to expect
us. We touch down in a handy LZ, take them out, and then dust off.’

Blouse’s clear brow wrinkled a little. ‘Flying machines?’ he said.

‘I saw a picture of one by someone called Leonard of Quirm. A sort of
. . . flying windmill. It’s just like a big screw up in the sky—’

‘I don’t think we need one of those, although the advice is welcomed,’
said Blouse.

‘Not when we’ve got a big screw-up down here, sir!’ Jackrum managed.
‘Sir, this is just a bunch of recruits, sir! All that stuff about honour
and freedom and that, that was just for the writer man, right? Good
idea, sir! Yeah, let’s get to the Kneck valley, and let’s sneak in and
join the rest of the lads. That’s where we ought to be, sir. You can’t
be serious about taking the _keep_, sir! I wouldn’t try that with a
thousand men.’

‘I might try it with half a dozen, sergeant.’

Jackrum’s eyes bulged. ‘Really, sir? What’ll Private Goom do? Tremble at
them? Young Igor will stitch ’em up, will he? Private Halter will give
’em a nasty look? They’re promising lads, sir, but they’re not _men_.’

‘General Tacticus said the fate of a battle may depend upon the actions
of one man in the right place, sergeant,’ said Blouse calmly.

‘_And_ having a lot more soldiers than the other bugger, sir,’ Jackrum
insisted. ‘Sir, we should get to the rest of the army. Maybe it’s
trapped, maybe it isn’t. All that stuff about them not wanting to
slaughter us, sir, that makes no sense. The idea is to win, sir. If the
rest of ’em have stopped attacking, it’s because they’re frightened of
us. We should be down there. That’s the place for young recruits, sir,
where they can _learn_. The enemy is looking for ’em, sir!’

‘If General Froc is among those captured, the keep will be where he is
held,’ said Blouse. ‘I believe he was the first officer you served under
as sergeant, am I right?’

Jackrum hesitated. ‘That’s right, sir,’ he said eventually. ‘And he was
the dumbest lieutenant I’ve ever met, bar one.’

‘I am positive there is a secret entrance into the keep, sergeant.’

Polly’s memory nudged her. If Paul was alive, he was in the keep. She
caught Shufti’s eye. The girl nodded. She’d been thinking along the same
lines. She didn’t talk much about her . . . fiancé, and Polly wondered
how official the arrangement was.

‘Permission to speak, sarge?’ she said.

‘Okay, Perks.’

‘I’d like to try to find a way into the keep, sarge.’

‘Perks, are you _volunteering_ to attack the biggest, strongest castle
within five hundred miles? Single-handed?’

‘I’ll go, too,’ said Shufti.

‘Oh, _two_ of you?’ said Jackrum. ‘Oh, well, _that’s_ all right then.’

‘I’ll go,’ said Wazzer. ‘The Duchess has told me that I should.’

Jackrum looked down at Wazzer’s thin little face and watery eyes, and
sighed. He turned back to Blouse. ‘Let’s get a move on, sir, shall we?
We can talk about this later. At least we’re headed to Kneck, first stop
on the road to hell. Perks and Igor, you take point. Maladict?’

‘Yo!’

‘Er . . . you scout on ahead.’

‘I hear you!’

‘Good.’

As the vampire walked past Polly the world, just for a moment, changed;
the forest became greener, the sky greyer, and she heard a noise
overhead, like ‘whopwhopwhop’. And then it was gone.

Vampire hallucinations are contagious, she thought. What’s going on in
his head? She hurried forward with Igorina, and they set off again
through the forest.

Birds sang. The effect was peaceful, if you didn’t know about birdsong,
but Polly could recognize the alarm calls close by and the territorial
threats far off and, everywhere, the preoccupation with sex. That took
the edge off the pleasure.⁸

‘Polly?’ said Igorina.

‘Hmm?’

‘Could you kill someone if you had to?’

Polly came right back to the here and now. ‘What sort of question is
that to ask anyone?’

‘I think it’s the sort you’d ask a tholdier,’ said Igorina.

‘I don’t know. If they were attacking me, I suppose. Hurt them hard
enough to keep them lying down, anyway. And you?’

‘We have a great respect for life, Polly,’ said Igorina solemnly. ‘It’s
easy to kill thomeone, and almost impossible to bring them back again.’

‘Almost?’

‘Well, if you don’t have a really good lightning rod. And even if you
have, they’re never quite the same. Cutlery tends to stick to them.’

‘Igorina, why are you _here_?’

‘The clan isn’t very . . . keen on girls getting too involved in the
Great Work,’ said Igorina, looking downcast. ‘“Stick to your
needlework”, my mother keeps saying. Well, that’s all very fine, but I
know I’m good at the actual incisions as well. Especially the fiddly
bits. And I think a woman on the slab would feel a lot better about
things if she knew there was a female hand on the we-belong-dead switch.
Tho I thought some battlefield experience would convince my father.
Soldiers aren’t choosy about who saves their lives.’

‘I suppose men are the same the world over,’ said Polly.

‘On the inside, certainly.’

‘And . . . er . . . you really can put your hair back?’ Polly had seen
it in its jar when they’d been breaking camp; it had spun gently in its
bottle of green liquid, like some fine, rare seaweed.

‘Oh, yes. Scalp transplants are easy. It stings a bit for a couple of
minutes, that’s all—’

There was movement between the trees, and then the blur resolved itself
into Maladict. He held a finger to his lips as he drew closer, and
whispered urgently: ‘Charlie’s tracking us!’

Polly and Igorina looked at one another. ‘_Who’s Charlie?_’

Maladict stared at them, and then rubbed his face distractedly. ‘I’m
. . . sorry, er . . . sorry, it’s . . . look, we’re being followed! I
know it!’

The sun was setting. Polly peered over the rocky ledge, back the way
they had come. She could make out the track, golden and red in the late
afternoon light. Nothing was moving. The outcrop was near the top of
another rounded hill; the rear of it became the floor of a little
enclosed space, surrounded by bushes. It made a good lookout for people
who wanted to see without being seen, and it had done so in the recent
past, by the look of the old fires.

Maladict was sitting with his head in his hands, with Jackrum and Blouse
on either side of him. They were trying to understand, and not making
much progress.

‘So you can’t _hear_ anything?’ said Blouse.

‘No.’

‘And you didn’t see anything and can’t smell anything?’ said Jackrum.

‘_No!_ I _told_ you! But there is something after us. Watching us!’

‘But if you can’t—’ Blouse began.

‘Look, I’m a vampire,’ panted Maladict. ‘Just _trust_ me, okay?’

‘I thould, tharge,’ said Igorina, from behind Jackrum. ‘We Igorth often
therve vampireth. In timeth of strethth their perthonal thpace can
extend ath much ath ten mileth from their body.’

There was the usual pause that follows an extended lisp. People need
time to think.

‘Streth-th?’ said Blouse.

‘You know how you can feel that someone’s looking at you?’ mumbled
Maladict. ‘Well, it’s like that, times a thousand. And it’s not a . . .
a feeling, it’s something I _know_.’

‘Lots of people are looking for us, corporal,’ said Blouse, patting him
kindly on the shoulder. ‘It doesn’t mean that they’ll find us.’

Polly, looking down on the gold-lit woodland, opened her mouth to speak.
It was dry. Nothing came out.

Maladict shook the lieutenant’s hand away. ‘This . . . person isn’t
looking for us! They know where we are!’

Polly forced saliva into her mouth, and tried again. ‘Movement!’

And then it wasn’t there any more. She’d have sworn there had been
something on the path, something that merged with the light, revealing
itself only by the changing, wavering pattern of shadows as it moved.

‘Er . . . perhaps not,’ she muttered.

‘Look, we’ve all lost sleep and we’re all a little “strung out”,’ said
Blouse. ‘Let’s just keep things down, shall we?’

‘I _need_ coffee!’ moaned Maladict, rocking back and forth.

Polly squinted at the distant pathway. The breeze was shaking the trees,
and red-gold leaves were drifting down. For a moment there was just a
_suggestion_ . . . She got to her feet. Stare at shadows and waving
branches for long enough and you could see anything. It was like looking
at pictures in the flames.

‘O-kay,’ said Shufti, who’d been working over the fire. ‘This might do
it. It smells like coffee, anyway. Well . . . quite like coffee. Well
. . . quite like coffee if coffee was made from acorns, anyway.’

She’d roasted some acorns. At least the woods had plenty of them at this
time of year, and everybody knew that roasted, ground acorns could be
substituted for coffee, didn’t they? Polly had agreed that it was a
worth a try, but as far as she could recall no one had ever, given the
choice, said ‘No, I will not touch horrible coffee any more! It’s a Long
Black ground-acorn substitute for me, with extra floating gritty bits!’

She took the mug from Shufti and carried it over to the vampire. As she
bent down . . . the world changed.

. . . _whopwhopwhop_ . . .

The sky was a haze of dust, turning the sun into a blood-red disc. For a
moment Polly saw _them_ in the sky, giant fat screws spinning in the
air, _hovering_ in the air but drifting slowly towards her—

‘He’s having flashsides,’ whispered Igorina, at her elbow.

‘Flashsides?’

‘Like . . . someone else’s flashbackth. We don’t know anything about
them. They could come from _anywhere_. A vampire at this stage is open
to all sorts of influences! Give him the coffee, please!’

Maladict grabbed the mug and tried to down the contents so quickly that
they spilled over his chin. They watched him swallow.

‘Tastes like mud,’ he said, putting down the mug.

‘Yes, but is it working?’

Maladict looked up and blinked his eyes. ‘Ye gods, that stuff is
_gruesome_.’

‘Are we in a forest or a jungle? Any flying screws?’ Igorina demanded.
‘How many fingers am I holding up?’

‘You know, that’s something an Igor should _never_ say,’ said Maladict,
grimacing. ‘But . . . the . . . feelings aren’t so strong. I can suck it
down! I can gut it out.’

Polly looked at Igorina, who shrugged and said, ‘That’s nice,’ and
motioned to Polly to join her a little way off.

‘He, or possibly she, is right on the edge,’ she said.

‘Well, we all are,’ said Polly. ‘We’re hardly getting any sleep.’

‘You know what I mean. I’ve, er . . . taken the liberty of, er . . .
being prepared.’ Wordlessly, Igorina let her jacket fall open, just for
a moment. Polly saw a knife, a wooden stake and a hammer, in neatly
stitched little pockets.

‘It’s not going to come to that, is it?’

‘I hope not,’ said Igorina. ‘But if it does, I’m the only one who can
reliably find the heart. People always think it’s more to the left
than—’

‘It’s _not_ going to come to that,’ said Polly firmly.

The sky was red. The war was a day away.

Polly crept along just below the ridge with the tea can. It was tea that
kept the army on its feet. Remember what’s real . . . well, that took
some doing. Tonker and Lofty, for example. It didn’t matter which of
them was on guard, the other one would be there as well. And there they
were, sitting side by side on a fallen tree, staring down the slope.
They were holding hands. They always held hands, when they thought they
were alone. But it seemed to Polly that they didn’t hold hands like
people who were, well, friends. They held hands tightly, as someone who
has slipped over a cliff would hold hands with a rescuer, fearing that
to let go would be to fall away.

‘Tea up!’ she quavered.

The girls turned, and she dipped a couple of mugs into the scalding tea.

‘You know,’ she said quietly, ‘no one would hate you if you ran away
tonight.’

‘What do you mean, Ozz?’ said Lofty.

‘Well, what’s there in Kneck for you? You got away from the school. You
could go anywhere. I bet the two of you could sneak—’

‘We’re staying,’ said Tonker severely. ‘We talked about it. Where else
would we go? Anyway, supposing something _is_ following us?’

‘Probably just an animal,’ said Polly, who didn’t believe it herself.

‘Animals don’t do that,’ said Tonker. ‘And I don’t think Maladict would
get so excited. It’s probably more spies. Well, we’ll _get_ them.’

‘Nobody is going to take us back,’ said Lofty.

‘Oh. Er . . . good,’ said Polly, backing away. ‘Well, must get on, no
one likes cold tea, eh?’

She hurried round the hill. Whenever Lofty and Tonker were together, she
felt like a trespasser.

Wazzer was on guard in a small dell, watching the land below with her
usual expression of slightly worrying intensity. She turned as Polly
approached.

‘Oh, Polly,’ said Wazzer. ‘Good news!’

‘Oh, good,’ said Polly weakly. ‘I like good news.’

‘She says it will be all right for us not to wear our dimity scarves,’
said Wazzer.

‘What? Oh. Good,’ said Polly.

‘But only because we are serving a Higher Purpose,’ said Wazzer. And,
just as Blouse could invert commas, Wazzer could drop capital letters
into a spoken sentence.

‘That’s good, then,’ said Polly.

‘You know, Polly,’ said Wazzer, ‘I think the world would be a lot better
if it was run by women. There wouldn’t be any wars. Of course, the Book
would consider such an idea a Dire Abomination unto Nuggan. It may be in
error. I shall consult the Duchess. Bless this cup that I may drink of
it,’ she added.

‘Er, yes,’ said Polly, and wondered what she should dread more: Maladict
suddenly turning into a ravening monster, or Wazzer reaching the end of
whatever mental journey she was taking. She’d been a kitchen maid and
now she was subjecting the Book to critical analysis and talking to a
religious icon. That sort of thing led to friction. The presence of
those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to those who think
they’ve found it.

Besides, she thought as she watched Wazzer drink, you only thought the
world would be better if it was run by women if you didn’t actually know
many women. Or old women, at least. Take the whole thing about the
dimity scarves. Women had to cover their hair on Fridays, but there was
nothing about this in the Book, which was pretty dar— pretty _damn_
rigorous about most things. It was just a custom. It was done because it
was always done. And if you forgot, or didn’t want to, the old women
_got_ you. They had eyes like hawks. They could practically see through
walls. And the men took notice, because no man wanted to cross the
crones in case they started watching _him_, so half-hearted punishment
would be dealt out. Whenever there was an execution, and especially when
there was a whipping, you always found the grannies in the front row,
sucking peppermints.

Polly had forgotten her dimity scarf. She did wear it at home on
Fridays, for no other reason than that it was easier than not doing so.
She vowed that, if ever she got back, she’d never do it again . . .

‘Er . . . Wazz?’ she said.

‘Yes, Polly?’

‘You’ve got a direct line to the Duchess, have you?’

‘We talk about things,’ said Wazzer dreamily.

‘You, er, couldn’t raise the question of coffee, could you?’ said Polly
wretchedly.

‘The Duchess can only move very, very small things,’ said Wazzer.

‘A few beans, perhaps? Wazz, we really _need_ some coffee! I don’t think
the acorns are that much of a substitute.’

‘I will pray,’ said Wazzer.

‘Good. You do that,’ said Polly. And, strangely enough, she felt a
little more hopeful. Maladict had hallucinations, but Wazzer had a
certainty you could bend steel round. It was the _opposite_ of a
hallucination, somehow. It was as if she could see what was real and you
couldn’t.

‘Polly?’ said Wazzer.

‘Yes?’

‘You don’t believe in the Duchess, do you? I mean the real Duchess, not
your inn.’

Polly looked into the small, pinched, intense face. ‘Well, I mean, they
say she’s dead, and I prayed to her when I was small, but since you ask
I don’t exactly, um, _believe_ as—’ she gabbled.

‘She is standing just behind you. Just behind your right shoulder.’

In the silence of the wood, Polly turned. ‘I can’t see her,’ she said.

‘I am happy for you,’ said Wazzer, handing her the empty mug.

‘But I didn’t see anything,’ said Polly.

‘No,’ said Wazzer. ‘But you turned round . . .’

Polly had never asked too many questions about the Girls’ Working
School. She was, by definition, a Good Girl. Her father was an
influential man in the community, and she worked hard, she didn’t have
much to do with men and, most importantly, she was . . . well, smart.
She was bright enough to do what a lot of other people did in the
chronic, reason-free insanity that was everyday life in Munz. She knew
what to see and what to ignore, when to obey and when to merely present
the face of obedience, when to speak and when to keep her thoughts to
herself. She learned the ways of the survivor. Most people did. But if
you rebelled, or were merely dangerously honest, or had the wrong kind
of illness, or were not wanted, or were a girl who liked boys more than
the old women thought you should and, worse, were not good at counting
. . . then the school was your destination.

She didn’t know much about what went on in there, but imagination rushed
to fill the gap. And she wondered what happened to you in that hellish
pressure cooker. If you were tough, like Tonker, it boiled you hard and
gave you a shell. Lofty . . . it was hard to know. She was quiet and shy
until you saw firelight reflected in her eyes, and sometimes the flames
were there in the absence of any fire to reflect. But if you were
Wazzer, dealt a poor hand to start with, and locked up, and starved, and
beaten, and mistreated Nuggan knew how (and yes, Polly thought, Nuggan
probably _did_ know how) and pushed deeper and deeper into yourself,
what would you find down there? And then you’d look up from those depths
into the only smile you ever saw.

The last man on guard duty was Jackrum, because Shufti was cooking. He
was sitting on a mossy rock, crossbow in one hand, staring at something
in his hand. He spun round as she approached, and Polly caught the gleam
of gold as something was shoved back in his jacket.

The sergeant lowered the bow. ‘You make enough noise for an elephant,
Perks,’ he said.

‘Sorry, sarge,’ said Polly, who knew she hadn’t. He took the tea mug,
and turned to point downhill.

‘See that bush down there, Perks?’ he said. ‘Just to the right of that
fallen log?’

Polly squinted. ‘Yes, sarge,’ she said.

‘Notice anything about it?’

Polly stared again. There must _be_ something wrong about it, she
decided, otherwise he wouldn’t have asked her. She concentrated. ‘The
shadow’s wrong,’ she decided at last.

‘Good lad. The reason bein’, our chum is behind the bush. He’s been
a-watching of me, and I’ve been a-watching of him. Nothing else for it.
He’ll have it away on his toes as soon as he sees anyone move, and he’s
too far away to drop an arrow on him.’

‘An enemy?’

‘I don’t think so.’

‘A _friend_?’

‘Cocky devil, at any rate. He doesn’t care that I know he’s there. You
go on back up the hill, lad, and bring down that big bow we got off of
the— There he goes!’

The shadow had vanished. Polly stared into the wood, but the long light
was getting crimson and dusk was unfolding between the trees.

‘It’s a wolf,’ said Jackrum.

‘A werewolf?’ said Polly.

‘Now, what makes you think that?’

‘Because Sergeant Towering said we’d got a werewolf in the squad. I’m
sure we haven’t. I mean, we’d have found out by now, wouldn’t we? But I
wondered if they’d seen one.’

‘Can’t do anything about it, anyway,’ said Jackrum. ‘A silver arrow
would do the job, but we’ve got none.’

‘What about our shilling, sarge?’

‘Oh, you think you can kill a werewolf with an IOU?’

‘Oh, yeah.’ Then Polly added: ‘_You’ve_ got a real shilling, sarge.
Around your neck with that gold medallion.’

If you could have twisted steel round Wazzer’s conviction, you could
have heated it with Jackrum’s glare.

‘What’s round my neck is no business of yours, Perks, and the only thing
worse than a werewolf is me if anyone tries to take my shilling off me,
understand?’

He softened as he saw Polly’s terrified expression. ‘We’ll move on after
we’ve eaten,’ he said. ‘Find a better place for a rest. Somewhere easier
to defend.’

‘We’re all pretty tired, sarge.’

‘So I want us all to be upright and armed if our friend comes back with
his chums,’ said Jackrum.

He followed her gaze. The gold locket had slipped out of his jacket, and
dangled guiltily on its chain. He deftly tucked it away.

‘She was just a . . . girl I knew,’ he said. ‘That’s all, right? It was
a long time ago.’

‘I didn’t _ask_ you, sarge,’ said Polly, backing away.

Jackrum’s shoulders settled. ‘That’s right, lad, you didn’t. And I ain’t
asking _you_ about anything, neither. But I reckon we’d better find the
corporal some coffee, eh?’

‘Amen to that, sarge!’

‘And our rupert’s dreaming of laurel wreaths all round his head, Perks.
We’ve got ourselves a goddamn hero here. Can’t think, can’t fight, no
bloody use at all except for a famous last stand and a medal sent to his
ol’ mum. And I’ve been in a few famous last stands, lad, and they’re
butcher shops. That’s what Blouse’s leading you into, mark my words.
What’ll you lot do then, eh? We’ve had a few scuffles, but that’s not
war. Think you’ll be man enough to stand, when the metal meets the
meat?’

‘You did, sarge,’ said Polly. ‘You said you were in a few last stands.’

‘Yeah, lad. But I was holding the metal.’

Polly walked back up the slope. All this, she thought, and we haven’t
even got there. Sarge is thinking about the girl he left behind . . .
well, that’s normal. And Tonker and Lofty only think about one another,
but I suppose after you’ve been in that school . . . and as for Wazzer
. . .

She wondered how she’d have survived the school. Would she have grown
hard, like Tonker? Would she have just folded up inside, like the maids
who came and went and worked hard and never had a name? Or perhaps _she_
would have become like Wazzer, and found some door in her own head . . .
_I may be lowly, but I talk to gods_.

. . . Wazzer had said ‘not your inn’. Had she ever _told_ Wazzer about
The Duchess? Surely not. Surely she . . . but, no, she had told Tonker,
hadn’t she? That was it, then. All explained. Tonker must have mentioned
it to Wazzer at some point. Nothing weird about it at all, even if
practically no one ever had a conversation with Wazz. It was so hard.
She was so intense, so coiled up. But that had to be the only
explanation. Yes. She wasn’t going to let there be any other.

Polly shivered, and was aware that someone was walking beside her. She
looked up and groaned.

‘You’re a hallucination, right?’

OH, YES. YOU ARE ALL IN A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SENSIBILITY CAUSED BY
MENTAL CONTAGION AND LACK OF SLEEP.

‘If you’re a hallucination, how do _you_ know that?’

I KNOW IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT. I AM SIMPLY BETTER AT ARTICULATING IT.

‘I’m not going to die, am I? I mean, right now?’

NO. BUT YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU WOULD WALK WITH DEATH EVERY DAY.

‘Oh . . . yes. Corporal Scallot said that.’

HE IS AN OLD FRIEND. YOU MIGHT SAY HE IS ON THE INSTALMENT PLAN.

‘Do you mind walking a bit more . . . invisibly?’

OF COURSE. HOW’S THIS?

‘And quietly, too?’

There was silence, which was presumably the answer.

‘And polish yourself up a bit,’ said Polly to the empty air. ‘And that
robe needs a wash.’

There was no reply, but she felt better for saying it.

Shufti had cooked beef stew with dumplings and herbs. It was
magnificent. It was also a mystery.

‘I don’t recall us passing a cow, private,’ said Blouse, as he handed
his tin plate along for a second helping.

‘Er . . . no, sir.’

‘And yet you have acquired beef?’

‘Er . . . yes, sir. Er . . . when that writer man came up in his cart,
well, when you were talking, er, I crept round and took a look inside
. . .’

‘There’s a name for someone who does that sort of thing, private,’ said
Blouse severely.

‘Yeah, it’s quartermaster, Shufti. Well done,’ said Jackrum. ‘If that
writer man gets hungry, he can always eat his words, eh, lieutenant?’

‘Er . . . yes,’ said Blouse carefully. ‘Yes. Of course. Good initiative,
private.’

‘Oh, I didn’t think it up, sir,’ said Shufti brightly. ‘Sarge told me
to.’

Polly stopped, spoon halfway to her mouth, and swivelled her eyes from
sergeant to lieutenant.

‘You teach looting, sergeant?’ said Blouse. There was a joint gasp from
the squad. If this was the bar back at The Duchess, the regulars would
have been hurrying out of the doors and Polly would have been helping
her father get the bottles off the shelf.

‘Not looting, sir, not looting,’ said Jackrum, calmly licking his spoon.
‘Under Duchess’s Regulations, Rule 611, Section 1 [c], Paragraph i, sir,
it would be plundering, said cart being the property of bloody
Ankh-Morpork, sir, which is aiding and abetting the enemy. Plundering is
_allowed_, sir.’

The two men held eye contact for a moment, and then Blouse reached
behind him and into his pack. Polly saw him draw out a small yet thick
book.

‘Rule 611,’ he murmured. Blouse glanced up at the sergeant, and thumbed
through the thin, shiny pages. ‘611. Pillaging, Plundering and Looting.
Ah, yes. And . . . let me see . . . you are with us, Sergeant Jackrum,
owing to Rule 796, I think you reminded me at the time . . .’

There was another silence broken only by the riffle of the pages.
There’s no Rule 796, Polly remembered. Are they going to _fight_ over
this?

‘796, 796,’ said Blouse softly. ‘Ah . . .’ He stared at the page, and
Jackrum stared at him.

Blouse closed the book with a leathery _flwap_. ‘Absolutely correct,
sergeant!’ he said brightly. ‘I commend you on your encyclopaedic
knowledge of the regulations!’

Jackrum looked thunderous. ‘What?’

‘You were practically word perfect, sergeant!’ said Blouse. And there
was a gleam in his eye. Polly remembered Blouse looking at the captured
cavalry captain. This was that same look, the look which said: _now_ I
have the upper hand.

Jackrum’s chins wobbled.

‘You had something to add, sergeant?’ said Blouse.

‘Er, no . . . sir,’ said Jackrum, his face an open declaration of war.

‘We’ll leave at moonrise,’ said Blouse. ‘I suggest we all get some rest
until then. And then . . . may we prevail.’ He nodded to the group, and
walked over to where Polly had spread his blanket in the lee of the
bushes. After a few moments there were some snores, which Polly refused
to believe. Jackrum certainly didn’t. He got up and strode out of the
firelight. Polly hurried after him.

‘Did you hear that?’ snarled the sergeant, staring out at the darkening
hills. ‘The little yoyo! What right has he got, checking up in the book
o’ words?’

‘Well, you did quote chapter and verse, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘So? Officers are s’posed to believe what they’re told. And then he
_smiled_! Did you see? Caught me out and smiled at me! Thinks he’s got
one over on me, just because he caught me out!’

‘You did lie, sarge.’

‘_I did not, Perks!_ It’s not lying when you do it to officers! It’s
presentin’ them with the world the way they think it ought to be! You
can’t let ’em start checkin’ up for themselves. They get the wrong
ideas. I told you, he’ll be the death of all of us. Invading the bloody
keep? The man’s wrong in the head!’

‘Sarge!’ said Polly urgently.

‘Yes, what?’

‘We’re being signalled, sarge!’

On a distant hilltop, twinkling like an early evening star, a white
light was flashing.

* * *

Blouse lowered his telescope. ‘They’re repeating “CQ”,’ he said. ‘And I
believe those longer pauses are when they’re aiming their tube in
different directions. They’re looking for their spies. “Seek You”, see?
Private Igor?’

‘Thur?’

‘You know how that tube works, don’t you?’

‘Oh, yeth, thur. You jutht light a flare in the box, and then it’th just
point and click.’

‘You’re not going to _answer_ it, are you, sir?’ said Jackrum,
horrified.

‘I am indeed, sergeant,’ said Blouse briskly. ‘Private Carborundum,
please assemble the tube. Manickle, please bring the lantern. I shall
need to read the code book.’

‘But that’ll give away our position!’ said Jackrum.

‘No, sergeant, because although this term may be unfamiliar to you I
intend to what we call “lie”,’ said Blouse. ‘Igor, I’m sure you have
some scissors, although I’d rather you didn’t attempt to repeat the
word.’

‘I have thome of the appliantheth you mention, thur,’ said Igorina
stiffly.

‘Good.’ Blouse looked round. ‘It’s almost pitch dark now. Ideal. Take my
blanket and cut, oh, a three-inch circle out of it, then tie the blanket
over the front of the tube.’

‘That will cut off motht of the light, thur!’

‘Indeed it will. My plan depends upon it,’ said Blouse proudly.

‘Sir, they will see the light, they’ll know we’re here,’ said Jackrum,
as though repeating things to a child.

‘I explained, sergeant. I will lie,’ said Blouse.

‘You _can’t_ lie when—’

‘Thank you for your input, sergeant, that will be all for now,’ said
Blouse. ‘Are we ready, Igor?’

‘Jutht about, thur,’ said Igorina, tying the blanket across the end of
the tube. ‘Okay, thur. I’ll light the flare when you thay.’

Blouse unfolded the little book. ‘Ready, private?’ he said.

‘Yup,’ said Jade.

‘On the word “long” you will hold the trigger for the count of two, and
then let go. On the word “short” you will hold it down for the count of
one, and likewise let go. Got that?’

‘Yup, el-tee. Could hold it down for lots, if you like,’ said Jade.
‘One, two, many, lots. I’m good at countin’. High as you like. Jus’ say
der word.’

‘Two will suffice,’ said Blouse. ‘And you, Private Goom, I want you to
take my telescope and look for long and short flashes from that light
over there, understand?’

Polly saw Wazzer’s face and said quickly: ‘I’ll do that, sir!’

A small white hand was laid on her arm. In the miserly glimmer of the
dark lantern, Wazzer’s eyes glowed with the light of certainty. ‘The
Duchess guides our footsteps now,’ she said, and took the telescope from
the lieutenant. ‘What we are doing is her work, sir.’

‘Is it? Oh. Well . . . that’s good,’ said Blouse.

‘She will bless this instrument of far seeing that I may use it,’ said
Wazzer.

‘Indeed?’ said Blouse nervously. ‘Well done. Now . . . are we ready?
Send as follows . . . long . . . long . . . short . . .’

The shutter in the tube clicked and rattled as the message flashed out
across the sky. When the troll lowered the tube, there was half a minute
of darkness. And then: ‘Short . . . long . . .’ Wazzer began.

Blouse held the code book up to his face, his lips moving as he read by
the pinpoints of light escaping from the loins of the box. ‘W . . . R
. . . U,’ he said. ‘And M . . . S . . . G . . . P . . . R . . .

‘ ‘That’s not a message!’ said Jackrum.’

On the contrary, they want to know where we are, because they’re having
trouble seeing our light,’ said Blouse. ‘Send as follows . . . short
. . .’

‘I protest, sir!’

Blouse lowered the book. ‘Sergeant, I am about to tell our spy that we
are seven miles further away than we really are, do you understand? And
I am certain they will believe us because I have artificially reduced
the light output from our device, do you understand? And I will tell
them that their spies have encountered a very large party of recruits
and deserters heading for the mountains and are in pursuit, do you
understand? I am making us _invisible_, do you understand? _Do you
understand_, Sergeant Jackrum?’

The squad held their breath.

Jackrum drew himself stiffly to attention. ‘Fully understood, sir!’ he
said.

‘Very well!’

Jackrum continued at attention as the messages were exchanged, like a
naughty pupil forced to stand by the teacher’s desk.

Messages flashed across the sky, from hilltop to hilltop. Lights
flickered. The clacks tube rattled. Wazzer called out the longs and
shorts. Blouse scribbled in the book. ‘S . . . P . . . P . . . 2,’ he
said aloud. ‘Hah. That’s an order to remain where we are.’

‘More flashes, sir,’ said Wazzer.

‘T . . . Y . . . E . . . 3. . .’ said Blouse, still making notes.
‘That’s “be ready to give aid”. N . . . V . . . A . . . S . . . N . . .
That’s . . .’

‘That’s not a code, sir!’ said Polly.

‘Private, send as follows right now!’ Blouse croaked. ‘Long . . . long
. . .’

The message went. They watched, while the dew fell and, overhead, the
stars came out and twinkled messages no one ever tried to read.

The clacks went silent.

‘Now we leave as soon as possible,’ said Blouse. He gave a little cough.
‘I believe the phrase is “Let us get the heck out of here”.’

‘Close, sir,’ said Polly. ‘Quite . . . close.’

There was an old, _very_ old Borogravian song with more Zs and Vs in it
than any lowlander could pronounce. It was called ‘Plogviehze!’ It meant
‘The Sun Has Risen! Let’s Make War!’ You needed a special kind of
history to get all that in one word.

Sam Vimes sighed. The little countries here fought because of the river,
because of idiot treaties, because of royal rows, but mostly they fought
because they had always fought. They made war, in fact, because the sun
came up.

This war had tied itself in a knot.

Downriver, the valley narrowed to a canyon before the Kneck plunged over
a waterfall a quarter of a mile high. Anyone trying to get up through
the jagged mountains there would find themselves in a world of gorges,
knife-edged ridges, permanent ice and even more permanent death. Anyone
trying to cross the Kneck into Zlobenia now would be butchered on the
shore. The only way out of the valley was back along the Kneck, which
would put an army under the shadow of the keep. That had been fine when
the keep was in Borogravian hands. Now that it had been captured, they’d
be passing in range of their own weapons.

. . . And such weapons! Vimes had seen catapults that would throw a
stone ball three miles. When it landed it would crack into needle-sharp
shards. Or there was the other machine that sent six-foot steel discs
skimming through the air. Once they’d hit the ground and leapt up again
they were unreliable as hell, but that only made them more terrifying.
Vimes had been told that the edged disc would probably keep going for
several hundred yards, no matter how many men or horses it encountered
on the way. And they were only the latest ideas. There were plenty of
conventional weapons, if by that you meant giant bows, catapults and
mangonels that hurled balls of Ephebian fire, which clung while it
burned.

From up here, in his draughty tower, he could see the fires of the
dug-in army all across the plain. They couldn’t retreat, and the
alliance, if that’s what you could call the petulant hubbub, didn’t dare
head up the valley into the heart of the country with that army at their
back, yet didn’t have enough men to hold the keep _and_ corral the
enemy.

And in a few weeks it would start to snow. The passes would fill up.
Nothing would be able to get through. And every day, thousands of men
and horses would need feeding. Of course, the men could, eventually, eat
the horses, thus settling two feeding problems at a stroke. After that
there would have to be the good ol’ leg rota, which Vimes understood
from one of the friendlier Zlobenians was a common feature of winter
warfare up here. Since he was Captain ‘Hopalong’ Splatzer, Vimes
believed him.

And then it would rain, and then the rain and the snowmelt together
would turn the damn river into a flood. But before that the alliance
would have bickered itself apart and gone home. All the Borogravians had
to do, in fact, was hold their ground to score a draw.

He swore under his breath. Prince Heinrich had inherited the throne in a
country where the chief export was a kind of hand-painted wooden clog,
but in ten years, he vowed, his capital city of Rigour would be ‘the
Ankh-Morpork of the mountains’! For some reason, he thought Ankh-Morpork
would be pleased about this.

He was anxious, he said, to learn the Ankh-Morpork way of doing things,
the kind of innocent ambition that could well lead an aspiring ruler to
. . . well, find out the Ankh-Morpork way of doing things. Heinrich had
a reputation locally for cunning, but Ankh-Morpork had overtaken cunning
a thousand years ago, had sped past devious, had left artful far behind
and had now, by a roundabout route, arrived at straightforward.

Vimes leafed through the papers on his desk, and looked up when he heard
a shrill, harsh cry outside. A buzzard came in a long, shallow swoop
through the open window and alighted on a makeshift perch at the far end
of the room. Vimes strolled over as the little figure on the bird’s back
raised his flying goggles.

‘How’s it going, Buggy?’ he said.

‘They’re getting suspicious, Mister Vimes. And Sergeant Angua says it’s
getting a bit risky now they’re so close.’

‘Tell her to come on in, then.’

‘Right, sir. And they still need coffee.’

‘Oh, damn! Haven’t they found _any_?’

‘No, sir, and it’s getting tricky with the vampire.’

‘Well, if they’re suspicious now then they’ll be _certain_ if we drop a
flask of coffee on them!’

‘Sergeant Angua says we’ll probably get away with it, sir. She didn’t
say why.’ The gnome looked expectantly at Vimes. So did his buzzard.
‘They’ve come a long way, sir. For a bunch of girls. Well . . . mostly
girls.’

Vimes reached out absent-mindedly to pet the bird.

‘Don’t, sir! She’ll have your thumb off!’ Buggy yelled.

There was a knock on the door, and Reg came in with a tray of raw meat.
‘Saw Buggy overhead, so I thought I’d nip down to the kitchens, sir.’

‘Well done, Reg. Don’t they ask why you want raw meat?’

‘Yes, sir. I tell them you eat it, sir.’

Vimes paused before answering. Reg meant well, after all.

‘Well, it probably can’t do my reputation any harm,’ he said. ‘By the
way, what was going down in the crypt?’

‘Oh, they’re not what I’d call proper zombies, sir,’ said Reg, selecting
a piece of meat and dangling it in front of Morag. ‘More like dead men
walking.’

‘Er . . . yes?’ said Vimes.

‘I mean there’s no real thinking going on,’ the zombie continued,
picking up another lump of raw rabbit. ‘No embracing the opportunities
of a life beyond the grave, sir. They’re just a lot of old memories on
legs. That sort of thing gives zombies a bad name, Mister Vimes. It
makes me so _angry_!’ Morag tried to snap at another lump of bloody
rabbit fur that Reg, oblivious for the moment, was waving aimlessly.

‘Er . . . Reg?’ said Buggy.

‘How hard can it be, sir, to move with the times? Now take me, for
example. One day I woke up dead. Did I—’

‘Reg!’ Vimes warned, as Morag’s head bobbed back and forth.

‘—take it lying down? No! And I didn’t—’

‘Reg, be careful! She’s just had two of your fingers off!’

‘What? Oh.’ Reg held up a denuded hand and stared at it. ‘Oh, now, will
you look at that?’ He peered down at the floor, with a hope that was
quickly dashed. ‘Blast. Any chance we can make her throw up?’

‘Only by sticking your fingers down her throat, Reg. Sorry. Buggy, do
the best you can, please. And you, Reg, go back downstairs and see if
they’ve got any coffee, will you?’

‘Oh dear,’ murmured Shufti.

‘It’s big,’ said Tonker.

Blouse said nothing.

‘Not seen it before, sir?’ said Jackrum cheerfully, as they stared at
the distant keep from where they lay in some bushes half a mile away.

If there is a fairy-tale scale for castles, where the top end is
occupied by those white, spire-encrusted castles with the blue pointy
roofs, then Kneck Keep was low, black and clung to its outcrop like a
storm cloud. A bed of the Kneck ran round it; along the peninsula on
which it was built the approach road was wide and bereft of cover and an
ideal stroll for those who were tired of life. Blouse took all this in.

‘Er, no, sergeant,’ he said. ‘I’ve seen pictures, of course, but . . .
they don’t do it justice.’

‘Any of them books you read tell you what to do, sir ?’ said Jackrum.
They were lying in some bushes half a mile away.

‘Possibly, sergeant. In _The Craft of War_, Song Sung Lo said: to win
without fighting is the greatest victory. The enemy wishes us to attack
where he is strongest. Therefore, we will disappoint him. A way will
present itself, sergeant.’

‘Well, it’s never presented itself to me, and I’ve been here dozens of
times,’ said Jackrum, still grinning. ‘Hah, even the rats’d have to
disguise themselves as washerwomen to get in _that_ place! Even if you
get up that road, you’ve got narrow entrances, holes in the ceiling to
pour hot oil through, gates everywhere that a troll couldn’t smash
through, coupla mazes, a hundred little ways you can be shot at. Oh,
it’s a wonderful place to attack.’

‘I wonder how the alliance got in?’ said Blouse.

‘Treachery, probably, sir. The world’s full of traitors. Or perhaps they
discovered the secret entrance, sir. You know, sir? The one you’re sure
is there. Or p’raps you’ve forgotten? It’s the sort of thing that can
slip your mind when you’re busy, I expect.’

‘We shall reconnoitre, sergeant,’ said Blouse coldly, as they crawled
out of the bushes. He brushed leaves off his uniform. Thalacephalos or,
as Blouse referred to her, ‘the faithful steed’ had been turned loose
miles back. You couldn’t sneak on horseback and, as Jackrum had pointed
out, the creature was too skinny for anyone to want to eat and too
vicious for anyone to want to ride.

‘Right, sir, yes, we might as well do that, sir,’ said Jackrum now, all
gloating helpfulness. ‘Where would you like us to reconnoitre, sir?’

‘There must _be_ a secret entrance, sergeant. No one would build a place
like that with only one entrance. Agreed?’

‘Yessir. Only, perhaps they kept it a secret, sir. Only trying to help,
sir.’

They turned at the sound of urgent praying. Wazzer had fallen to her
knees, hands clasped together. The rest of the squad edged away slowly.
Piety is a wonderful thing.

‘What is he doing, sergeant?’ said Blouse.

‘Praying, sir,’ said Jackrum.

‘I’ve noticed he does it a lot. Is that, er, within regulations,
sergeant?’ the lieutenant whispered.

‘Always a difficult one, sir, that one,’ said Jackrum. ‘I have, myself,
prayed many times on the field of battle. Many times have I said the
Soldier’s Prayer, sir, and I don’t mind admitting it.’

‘Er . . . I don’t think I know that one,’ said Blouse.

‘Oh, I reckon the words’ll come to you soon enough, sir, once you’re up
against the foe. Gen’rally, though, they’re on the lines of “O god, let
me kill this bastard before he kills me”.’ Jackrum grinned at Blouse’s
expression. ‘That’s what I call the Authorized Version, sir.’

‘Yes, sergeant, but where would we be if we all prayed all the time?’
said the lieutenant.

‘In heaven, sir, sitting at Nuggan’s right hand,’ said Jackrum promptly.
‘That’s what I was taught as a little nipper, sir. Of course, it’d be a
bit crowded, so it’s just as well we don’t.’

At which point, Wazzer stopped praying and stood up, brushing dust off
her knees. She gave the squad her bright, worrying smile. ‘The Duchess
will guide our steps,’ she said.

‘Oh. Good,’ said Blouse weakly.

‘She will show us the way.’

‘Wonderful. Er . . . did she mention a map reference at all?’ said the
lieutenant.

‘She will give us eyes that we might see.’

‘Ah? Good. Well, jolly good,’ said Blouse. ‘I definitely feel a lot
better for knowing that. Don’t you, sergeant?’

‘Yessir,’ said Jackrum. ‘’cos before this, sir, we didn’t _have_ a
prayer.’

They scouted in threes, while the rest of the squad lay up in a deep
hollow among the bushes. There were enemy patrols, but it’s not hard to
avoid half a dozen men who stick to the tracks and aren’t being careful
not to make a noise. The troops were Zlobenian, and acted as though they
owned the place.

For some reason Polly ended up patrolling with Maladict and Wazzer or,
to put it another way, a vampire on the edge and a girl who was possibly
so far over it that she’d found a new edge out beyond the horizon. She
was changing every day, that was a fact. On the day they’d all joined
up, a lifetime ago, she’d been this shivering little waif who flinched
at shadows. Now, sometimes, she seemed taller, full of some ethereal
certainty, and shadows fled before her. Well, not in actual fact, Polly
would admit. But she walked as if they should.

And then there had been the Miracle of the Turkey. That was hard to
explain.

The three of them had been moving along the cliffs. They’d circled a
couple of Zlobenian lookout posts, forewarned by the smell of
cooking-fires but, alas, not by the smell of any coffee. Maladict seemed
to be mostly in control, except for a tendency to mutter to himself in
letters and numbers, but Polly had stopped that by threatening to hit
him with a stick the very next time he did it.

They’d reached a cliff edge that gave yet another view of the keep, and
once again Polly raised the telescope and scanned the sheer walls and
jumbled rocks for any sign of another entrance.

‘Look down at the river,’ said Wazzer.

The circle of view blurred upwards as Polly shifted the scope; when it
stopped moving she saw whiteness. She had to lower the instrument to see
what she’d been looking at.

‘Oh my,’ she said.

‘Makes sense, though,’ said Maladict. ‘And there’s a path all along the
river, see? There’s a couple more women on it.’

‘Tiny gateway, though,’ said Polly. ‘And it’d be so easy to search
people for weapons.’

‘Soldiers couldn’t get through, them,’ said the vampire.

‘We could,’ said Polly. ‘And _we’re_ soldiers. Aren’t we?’

There was a pause before Maladict said: ‘Soldiers need _weapons_. Swords
and crossbows get noticed.’

‘There will be weapons inside,’ said Wazzer. ‘The Duchess has told me.
The castle is _full_ of weapons.’

‘Did she tell you how to make the enemy let go of them?’ said Maladict.

‘All right, all right,’ said Polly quickly. ‘We ought to tell the rupert
as soon as possible, okay? Let’s get back.’

‘Hold on, I’m the corporal,’ said Maladict.

‘Well?’ said Polly. ‘And?’

‘Let’s get back?’ said Maladict.

‘Good idea.’

She should have listened to the birdsong, she realized later. The shrill
calls in the distance would have told her the news, if only she’d been
calm enough to listen.

They hadn’t gone more than thirty yards before they saw the soldier.

Someone in the Zlobenian army was dangerously clever. He’d realized that
the way to spot interlopers was not to march noisily along the beaten
paths, but to sneak quietly between the trees.

The soldier had a crossbow; it was sheer luck . . . _probably_ sheer
luck that he was looking the other way when Polly came round a holly
bush. She flung herself behind a tree and gestured madly at Maladict
further down the path, who had the sense to take cover.

Polly drew her sword and held it clutched to her chest in both hands.
She could hear the man. He was some way away, but he was moving towards
her. Probably the little lookout they had just found was a regular point
on the patrol route. After all, she thought bitterly, it was just the
sort of thing some untrained idiots might come across; maybe a quiet
patrol could even surprise them there . . .

She shut her eyes and tried to breathe normally. This was it _this was
it_ this was it! This was where she found out.

What to remember _what to remember_ what to remember . . . when the
metal meets the meat . . . be holding the metal.

She could _taste_ metal in her mouth.

The man would walk right past her. He’d be alert, but not _that_ alert.
A slash would be better than a stab. Yes, a good swipe at head height
would kill . . .

. . . _some mother’s son, some sister’s brother, some lad who’d followed
the drum for a shilling and his first new suit. If only she’d been
trained, if only she’d had a few weeks stabbing straw men until she
could believe that all men were made of straw_ . . .

She froze. Down the angle of the path, still as a tree, head bowed,
stood Wazzer. As soon as the scout reached Polly’s tree, she’d be seen.

She’d have to do it now. Perhaps that’s why men did it. You didn’t do it
to save duchesses, or countries. You killed the enemy to stop him
killing your mates, that they in turn might save you . . .

She could hear the cautious tread close to the tree. She raised the
sabre, saw the light flash along its edge—

A wild turkey rose from the scrub on the other side of the path in one
rocketing tower of wings and feathers and echoing noise. Half flying,
half running, it bounded off into the woods. There was the thud of a bow
and a last squawk.

‘Oh, good shot, Woody,’ said a voice near by. ‘Looks like a big ’un!’

‘Did you see _that_?’ said another voice. ‘Another step and I’d have
tripped over it!’

Behind her tree, Polly breathed out.

A third voice, some way off, called out: ‘Let’s head back, eh, corp? The
way that went off, the Tiger’s probably run a mile!’

‘Yeah, and I’m so scared,’ said the closest voice. ‘The Tiger’s behind
every tree, right?’

‘Okay, let’s call it a day. My wife’ll cook him a treat—’

Gradually, the voices of the soldiers got lost amongst the trees. Polly
lowered the sword. She saw Maladict peer out of his bush and stare at
her. She raised a finger to her lips. He nodded. She waited until the
birdsong had settled down a little before stepping out. Wazzer seemed to
be lost in thought; Polly took her very carefully by the hand. Quietly,
dodging from tree to tree, they headed back to the hollow. Most
particularly, Polly and Maladict didn’t talk. But they looked one
another in the eye once or twice.

_Of course_ a turkey would lie low until a hunter almost trod on it. Of
course that one must’ve been there all the time, and only lost its bird
nerve when the scout crept up. It had been an unusually large bird, one
that no hungry soldier could resist, but . . . well?

Because the brain treacherously does not stop thinking just because you
want it to, Polly’s added: she said the Duchess could move small things.
How small is a thought in the mind of a bird?

Only Jade and Igorina were waiting for them in the hollow. The others
had found a better base a mile away, they said.

‘We found the secret entrance,’ said Polly quietly, as they headed away.

‘Can we get in?’ said Igorina.

‘It’s the washerwomen’s entrance,’ said Maladict. ‘It’s right down by
the river. But there’s a path.’

‘Washerwomen?’ said Igorina. ‘But this is a _war_!’

‘Clothes still get dirty, I suppose,’ said Polly.

‘Dirtier, I should think,’ said Maladict.

‘But . . . our countrywomen? Washing clothes for the enemy?’ said
Igorina, looking shocked.

‘If it’s that or starve, yes,’ said Polly. ‘I saw a woman come out
carrying a basket of loaves. They say the keep is full of granaries.
Anyway, you sewed up an enemy officer, didn’t you?’

‘That’s different,’ said Igorina. ‘We are duty bound to thave our fellow
ma— person. Nothing has ever been said about his— their underwear.’

‘We could get in,’ said Polly, ‘if we disguised ourselves as women.’

Silence greeted this. Then: ‘Disguised?’ said Igorina.

‘You know what I mean!’ said Polly.

‘_As washerwomen?_’ said Igorina. ‘These are _thurgeon’s_ hands!’

‘Really? Where did you get them?’ said Maladict. Igorina stuck out her
tongue at him.

‘Anyway, I don’t intend that we should do any washing,’ said Polly.

‘Then what _do_ you intend?’ said Igorina.

Polly hesitated. ‘I want to get my brother out if he’s in there,’ she
said. ‘And if we could stop the invasion that would be a good idea.’

‘That might take extra starch,’ said Maladict. ‘I don’t want to, you
know, spoil the spirit of the moment, but that is a really awful idea.
The el-tee won’t agree to something as wild as that.’

‘No, he won’t,’ said Polly. ‘But he’ll suggest it.’

‘Hmm,’ said Blouse, a little later. ‘Washerwomen? Is that _usual_,
Sergeant Jackrum?’

‘Oh, yes, sir. I expect the women in the villages round here do it, just
like they did when we held the keep,’ said Jackrum.

‘You mean they give aid and comfort to the enemy? Why?’

‘Better than starving, sir. Fact of life. It doesn’t always stop at
washing, neither.’

‘Sergeant, there are young men here!’ snapped Blouse, blushing.

‘They’ll have to find out about ironing and darning sooner or later,
sir,’ said Jackrum, grinning.

Blouse opened his mouth. Blouse shut his mouth.

‘Tea’s up, sir,’ said Polly. Tea was an amazingly useful thing. It gave
you an excuse to talk to anyone.

They were in what remained of a half-ruined farmhouse. By the look of
it, not even patrols bothered to come here – there were no signs of
former fires or even the most temporary occupation. It stank of decay
and half the roof was gone.

‘Do the women just come and go, Perks?’ said the lieutenant.

‘Yes, sir,’ said Polly. ‘And I had an idea, sir. Permission to tell you
my idea, sir?’ She saw Jackrum raise an eyebrow. She was laying it on
thick, she had to admit, but time was pressing.

‘Please do, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘Else I fear you may explode.’

‘They could be spies for us, sir! We could even get them to open the
gates for us!’

‘Well done, private!’ said Blouse. ‘I do like a soldier to think.’

‘Yeah, right,’ growled Jackrum. ‘Any sharper an’ he’ll cut hisself. Sir,
they’re _washerwomen_, sir, basically. No offence to young Perks, keen
lad that he is, but your average guard pays attention when Old Mother
Riley tries to open the gates. There’s not just a pair of gates,
neither. There’s _six_ pairs, and nice little courtyards between ’em for
the guards to have a squint at you to see if you’s a wrong ’un, and
drawbridges, and spiky ceilings that drop down if someone doesn’t like
the look of you. Try opening _that_ lot with soapy hands!’

‘I’m afraid the sergeant has a point, Perks,’ said Blouse sadly.

‘Well, supposing a couple of women managed to knock out a few guards,
sir, they could let us in through their little door,’ said Polly. ‘We
might even be able to capture the commander of the fort, sir! I bet
there’s plenty of women in the keep, sir. In the kitchens and so on.
They could . . . open doors for us!’

‘Oh, come on, Perks—’ Jackrum began.

‘No, sergeant. Wait,’ said Blouse. ‘Astonishingly enough, Perks, in your
boyish enthusiasm you have, although you haven’t realized it, given me a
very interesting idea . . .’

‘Have I, sir?’ said Polly, who in her boyish enthusiasm had considered
trying to tattoo the idea on Blouse’s head. For someone so clever, he
really was slow.

‘Indeed you have, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘Because, of course, we only need
one “washerwoman” to get us inside, do we not?’

The inverted commas sounded promising. ‘Well, yes, sir,’ said Polly.

‘And, if one as it were thinks “outside the box”, the “woman” does not
in fact _need_ to be a woman!’

Blouse beamed. Polly allowed her brow to wrinkle in honest puzzlement.

‘Doesn’t she, sir?’ she said. ‘I don’t think I quite understand, sir. I
am perplexed, sir.’

‘“She” could be a man, Perks!’ said Blouse, almost exploding with
delight. ‘One of us! In disguise!’

Polly breathed a sigh of relief. Sergeant Jackrum laughed.

‘Lord bless you, sir, dressing up as washerwomen is for gettin’ _out_ of
places! Milit’ry rules!’

‘If a man gets inside, he could disable any guards near the door, spy
out the situation from a military perspective, and let the rest of the
troops in!’ said Blouse. ‘If this was done at night, men, we could be
holding key positions by the morning!’

‘But these aren’t men, sir,’ said Jackrum. Polly turned. The sergeant
was looking right at her, right _through_ her_. Oh darn, I mean damn
. . . he knows_ . . .

‘I beg your pardon?’

‘They are . . . my little lads, sir,’ Jackrum went on, winking at Polly.
‘Keen lads, full of mustard, but they ain’t ones for cuttin’ throats and
stabbin’ hearts. They signed up to be pikemen in the press, sir, in a
proper army. You are my little lads, I says to ’em when I signed ’em up,
and I _will_ look after you. I can’t stand by and let you take ’em to
certain death!’

‘It’s my decision to make, sergeant,’ said Blouse. ‘We are at “the hinge
of destiny”. Who, in the pinch, is not ready to lay down his life for
his country?’

‘In a proper stand-up fight, sir, not getting beaten over the head by a
bunch of nasty men for creeping around their fort. You know I’ve never
been one for spies an’ hidin’ your colours, sir, never.’

‘Sergeant, we have no choice. We must take advantage of the “tide of
fortune”.’

‘I know about tides, sir. They leave little fish gaspin’.’ The sergeant
stood up, fists clenching.

‘Your concern for your men does you credit, sergeant, but it falls to
us—’

‘A famous last stand, sir?’ said Jackrum. He spat expertly into the fire
in the tumbledown hearth. ‘To hell with them, sir. That’s just a way of
dyin’ famous!’

‘Sergeant, your insubordination is getting—’

‘I’ll go,’ said Polly quietly.

Both men stopped, turned and stared.

‘I’ll go,’ Polly repeated, louder. ‘Someone ought to.’

‘Don’t be daft, Perks!’ snapped Jackrum. ‘You don’t know what’s in
there, you don’t know what guards are waitin’ just inside the door, you
don’t know—’

‘I’ll find out, then, sarge, won’t I,’ said Polly, smiling desperately.
‘Maybe I can get to somewhere where you can see and send signals, or—’

‘On this issue, at least, the sergeant and I are of one mind, Perks,’
said Blouse. ‘Really, private, it would simply not work. Oh, you’re
brave, certainly, but what makes _you_ think you stand a chance of
passing yourself off as a woman?’

‘Well, sir . . . _what_?’

‘Your keenness will not go unrecorded, Perks,’ said Blouse, smiling.
‘But, y’know, a good officer keeps an eye on his men and I have to say
that I’ve noticed in you, in _all_ of you, little . . . habits,
perfectly normal, nothing to worry about, like the occasional deep
exploration of a nostril maybe, and a tendency to grin after passing
wind, a natural boyish inclination to, ahem, scratch your . . . selves
in public . . . that sort of thing. These are the kind of little details
that’d give you away in a trice and tell any observer that you were a
man in women’s clothing, believe me.’

‘I’m sure I could pull it off, sir,’ said Polly weakly. She could sense
Jackrum’s eyes on her. _You bloomi— you bloody well know, don’t you! How
long have you known?_

Blouse shook his head. ‘No, they would see through you in a flash. You
are a fine bunch of lads, but there is only one man here who’d stand a
chance of getting away with it. Manickle?’

‘Yessir?’ said Shufti, rigid with instant panic.

‘Can you find me a dress, do you think?’

Maladict was the first to break the silence. ‘Sir, are you telling us
. . . _you’re_ going to try to get in dressed as a woman?’

‘Well, I’m clearly the only one who’s had any practice,’ said Blouse,
rubbing his hands together. ‘At my old school, we were in and out of
skirts all the time.’ He looked around at the circle of absolutely
expressionless faces. ‘Theatricals, you see?’ he said brightly. ‘No gels
at our boarding school, of course. But we didn’t let _that_ stop us.
Why, my Lady Spritely in _A Comedy of Cuckolds_ is still talked about, I
understand, and as for my Yumyum— Is Sergeant Jackrum all right?’

The sergeant had folded up, but with his face level with his knees he
managed to croak: ‘Old war wound, sir. Come upon me sudden, like.’

‘Please help him, Private Igor. Where was I . . . I can see you all look
puzzled, but there’s nothing _strange_ about this. Fine old tradition,
men dressing up as gels. In the sixth form, the chaps used to do it for
a jape all the time.’ He paused for a moment, and added thoughtfully,
‘Especially Wrigglesworth, for some reason . . .’ He shook his head as
if dislodging a thought and went on: ‘Anyway, I have some experience in
this field, d’ye see?’

‘And . . . what would you do if— I mean _when_ you got in, sir?’ said
Polly. ‘You won’t just have to fool the guards. There’ll be other women
in there.’

‘That will not present a problem, Perks,’ said Blouse. ‘I shall act in a
feminine way and I have this stage trick, d’ye see, where I make my
voice sound _quite high-pitched, like this_.’ The falsetto could have
scratched glass. ‘See?’ he said. ‘No, if we need a woman, I’m your man.’

‘Amazing, sir,’ said Maladict. ‘For a moment I could have sworn there
was a woman in the room.’

‘And I could certainly find out if there are any other badly guarded
entrances,’ Blouse went on. ‘Who knows, I might even be able to procure
a key off one of the guards by means of feminine wiles! In any case, if
things are all clear I shall send a signal. A towel hanging from a
window, perhaps. Something clearly unusual, anyway.’

There was some more silence. Several of the squad were staring at the
ceiling.

‘Ye-es,’ said Polly. ‘I can see you’ve thought this out carefully, sir.’

Blouse sighed. ‘If only Wrigglesworth were here,’ he said.

‘Why, sir?’

‘Amazingly clever chap at layin’ his hands on a dress, young
Wrigglesworth,’ said the lieutenant.

Polly caught Maladict’s eye. The vampire made a face and shrugged.

‘Um . . .’ said Shufti.

‘Yes, Manickle?’

‘I do have a petticoat in my pack, sir.’

‘Good heavens! Why?’

Shufti went red. She hadn’t worked out an answer.

‘Bandageth, thur,’ Igorina cut in smoothly.

‘Yes! Yes! That’s right!’ said Shufti. ‘I . . . found it in the inn,
back in Plün . . .’

‘I athked the lads to acquire any thuitable linen they might find, thur.
Jutht in cathe.’

‘Very sound thinking, that man!’ said Blouse. ‘Anyone else got
anything?’

‘I wouldn’t be at all thurprithed, thur,’ said Igorina, staring round
the room.

Glances were exchanged. Packs were unslung. Everyone except Polly and
Maladict had _something_, produced with downcast eyes. A shift, a
petticoat and, in most cases, a dimity scarf, carried out of some sort
of residual, unexplainable need.

‘You obviously must’ve thought we’d take serious damage,’ said Blouse.

‘Can’t be too careful, thur,’ said Igorina. She grinned at Polly.

‘Of course, I have rather short hair at present . . .’ Blouse mused.

Polly thought of her ringlets, now lost and probably stroked by Strappi.
But desperation spooled through her memory.

‘They looked like older women, mostly,’ she said quickly. ‘They wore
headscarves and wimples. I’m sure Igori— sure Igor can make up
something, sir.’

‘We Igorth are very rethortheful, thur,’ Igorina agreed. She pulled a
black leather wallet out of her jacket. ‘Ten minuteth with a needle,
thur, that’th all I need.’

‘Oh, I can do _old_ women wonderfully well,’ said Blouse. With a speed
that made Lofty jump, he suddenly thrust out both hands twisted like
claws, contorted his face into an expression of mad imbecility and
screeched, ‘Oh deary me! My poor old feet! Things today aren’t what they
used to be! Lawks!’

Behind him, Sergeant Jackrum put his head in his hands.

‘Amazing, sir,’ said Maladict. ‘I’ve never seen a transformation like
it!’

‘Perhaps just a wee bit less old, sir?’ Polly suggested, although in
truth Blouse had reminded her of her Auntie Hattie two-thirds of the way
through a glass of sherry.

‘You think so?’ said Blouse. ‘Oh, well, if you’re really sure.’

‘And, er, if you _do_ meet a guard, er, old women don’t usually try to,
try to—’

‘—canoodle—’ whispered Maladict, whose mind had clearly been hurtling
down the same horrible slope.

‘—canoodle with them,’ Polly finished, blushing, and then after a
second’s thought added, ‘Unless she’s had a glass of sherry, anyway.’

‘And I do thuggetht you go and have a thhave, thur . . .’

‘Thhave?’ said Blouse.

‘Shave, sir,’ said Polly. ‘I’ll lay out the kit, sir.’

‘Ooh, yes. Of course. Don’t see many old women with beards, eh? Except
my Auntie Parthenope, as I recall. And . . . er . . . no one’s got a
couple of balloons, have they?’

‘Er, why, sir?’ said Tonker.

‘A big bosom always gets a laugh,’ said Blouse. He looked round the row
of faces. ‘Not a good idea, perhaps? I got a huge round of applause as
the Widow Trembler in _’Tis Pity She’s A Tree_. No?’

‘I think Igor could sew something a bit more, er, realistic, sir,’ said
Polly.

‘Really? Oh, well, if you really think so . . .’ said Blouse dejectedly.
‘I’ll just go and get myself into character.’

He disappeared into the building’s only other room. After a few seconds,
the rest of them heard him reciting ‘Lawks, my poor feet!’ in varying
tones of fingernail screech.

The squad went into a huddle.

‘What was all _that_ about?’ said Tonker.

‘He was talking about the theatre,’ said Maladict.

‘What’s that?’

‘An Abomination unto Nuggan, of course,’ said the vampire. ‘It’d take
too long to explain, dear child. People pretending to be other people to
tell a story in a huge room where the world is a different place. Other
people sitting and watching them and eating chocolate. Very, very
abominable.’

‘I saw a Punch and Judy show in the town once,’ said Shufti. ‘Then they
dragged the man away and it became an Abomination.’

‘I remember that,’ said Polly. Crocodiles should not be seen to eat
figures of authority, apparently, although until the puppet show no one
in the town knew what a crocodile was. The bit where the clown had
beaten his wife had also constituted an Abomination, because he’d used a
stick thicker than the regulation one inch.

‘The lieutenant won’t last a minute, you know,’ she said.

‘Yes, but he won’t lithten, will he?’ said Igorina. ‘I’ll do my betht
with my scissorth and needle to make a woman of him, but—’

‘Igorina, when it’s _you_ talking about this sort of thing some very
strange pictures turn up in my head,’ said Maladict.

‘Sorry,’ said Igorina.

‘Can you pray for him, Wazzer?’ said Polly. ‘I think we’re going to need
a miracle here.’

Wazzer obediently closed her eyes and folded her hands for a moment and
then said shyly: ‘I’m afraid she says it will take more than a turkey.’

‘Wazz?’ said Polly. ‘Do you really—’ Then she stopped, with the bright
little face watching her.

‘Yes, I do,’ said Wazzer. ‘I really talk to the Duchess.’

‘Yeah, well, I used to, too,’ snapped Tonker. ‘I used to beg her, once.
That stupid face just stared and did nothing. She never _stopped_
anything. All that stuff, all that stupid—’ The girl stopped, too many
words blocking her brain. ‘Anyway, why should she talk to _you_?’

‘Because I listen,’ said Wazzer quietly.

‘And what does she say?’

‘Sometimes she just cries.’

‘_She_ cries?’

‘Because there are so many things that people want, and she can’t give
them anything.’ Wazzer gave them all one of her smiles that lit up the
room. ‘But everything will be fine when I am in the right place,’ she
said.

‘Well, that’s all right, then—’ Polly began, in that cloud of deep
embarrassment that Wazzer called up within her.

‘Yeah, right,’ said Tonker. ‘But I’m not praying to anyone, okay? Ever
again. I don’t like this, Wazz. You’re a decent kid, but I don’t like
the way you smile—’ She stopped. ‘Oh, no . . .’

Polly stared at Wazzer. Her face was thin and all angles, and the
Duchess in the painting had looked, well, like an overfed turbot, but
now the smile, the actual _smile_ . . .

‘I’m not putting up with that!’ Tonker snarled. ‘You stop that right
now! I mean it! You’re giving me the creeps! Ozz, you stop her— him
smiling like that!’

‘Just calm down, all of you—’ Polly began.

‘Bleedin’ well shut up!’ said Jackrum. ‘A man can’t hear himself chew.
Look, you’re all edgy. That happens. And Wazzer here’s just got a bit of
religion before the fight. That happens, too. And what you do is, you
save it all up for the enemy. Quieten down. That is what we in the
milit’ry call an order, okay?’

‘Perks?’ It was Blouse.

‘You’d better hurry,’ said Maladict. ‘His corset probably wants lacing
. . .’

In fact Blouse was sitting on what remained of a chair.

‘Ah, Perks. A shave, please,’ he said.

‘Oh, I thought your hand was better, sir . . .’

‘Er . . . yes.’ Blouse looked awkward. ‘The problem, Perks, is . . . I
have never actually shaved myself at all, to be honest. I had a man to
do it for me at school, and then of course in the army I shared a batman
with Blitherskite and, er, those attempts I made on my own behalf have
been somewhat bloody. I never really thought about it until I got to
Plotz and, er . . . suddenly it was embarrassing . . .’

‘Sorry about that, sir,’ said Polly. It was a strange old world.

‘Later on perhaps you could give me a few tips,’ Blouse went on. ‘You
keep yourself beautifully shaven, I can’t help noticing. General Froc
would be pleased. He’s very anti-whiskers, they say.’

‘If you like, sir,’ said Polly. There was no getting out of it. She made
a show of sharpening the razor. Perhaps she could manage it with only a
few small cuts . . .

‘Do you think I should have a reddened nose?’ said Blouse.

‘Probably, sir,’ said Polly. _Sarge knows about me, I’m sure_, she
thought. _I know he does. Why’s he keeping quiet?_

‘Probably, Perks?’

‘What? Oh. No . . . why a red nose, sir?’ said Polly, applying the
lather with vigour.

‘It would look more _pff_ amusing, perhaps.’

‘Not sure that’s the purpose of the exercise, sir. Now, if you’d just,
er, lie back, sir—’

‘_There’s something you should know about young Perks, sir_.’

Polly actually yelped. Walking as silently as only a sergeant can,
Jackrum had stolen into the room.

‘_pff_ Sergeant?’ said Blouse.

‘Perks doesn’t know how to shave a man, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Give me the
razor, Perks.’

‘Doesn’t know how to shave?’ said Blouse.

‘Nosir. Perks lied to us, right, Perks?’

‘All right, sarge, no need to drag it out,’ sighed Polly. ‘Lieutenant,
I’m—’

‘—under age,’ said Jackrum. ‘Right, Perks? Only fourteen, aren’t you?’
He looked at Polly over the top of the lieutenant’s head, and winked.

‘Er . . . I told a lie to get enlisted, sir, yes,’ said Polly.

‘I don’t think a lad like that ought to be dragged into the keep,
however game he is,’ said Jackrum. ‘And I don’t think he’s the only one.
Right, Perks?’

_Oh, so that’s the game. Blackmail_, Polly thought.

‘Yes, sarge,’ she said wearily.

‘Can’t have a massacre of little lads, sir, now can we?’ said Jackrum.

‘I see your _pff_ point, sergeant,’ said the lieutenant, as Jackrum
gently drove the blade down his cheek. ‘That is a tricky one.’

‘Best to call it a day, then?’ said Jackrum.

‘On the other hand, sergeant, I do know that you _pff_ yourself joined
up as a child,’ said Blouse. The blade stopped moving.

‘Well, it was all different in those—’ Jackrum began.

‘You were five years old, apparently,’ the lieutenant went on. ‘You see,
when I heard that I would be meeting you, a legend in the army, of
course I had a look at our files so that I could, perhaps, make a few
timely jokes in presenting you with your honourable discharge. You know,
humorous little reminiscences about times gone by? Imagine how puzzled I
was, therefore, to find that you appear to have been drawing actual
wages for, well, it was a little hard to be certain, but possibly as
much as sixty years.’

Polly had put a keen edge on the razor. It rested against the
lieutenant’s cheek. Polly thought about the murder – oh, all right, the
killing of an escaping prisoner – in the wood. _It won’t be the first
officer I’ve killed_ . . .

‘Probably one of them clerical errors, sir,’ said Jackrum coldly. In the
gloomy room, with moss now colonizing the walls, the sergeant loomed
large.

An owl, perched on the chimney, gave a screech. It echoed down into the
room.

‘In fact no, sergeant,’ said Blouse, apparently oblivious of the razor.
‘Your package, sergeant, had been tampered with. On numerous occasions.
Once, even by General Froc. He deducted ten years from your age and
signed the change. And he wasn’t the only one. Frankly, sergeant, I’m
forced to only one conclusion.’

‘And what’s that, sir?’ The razor halted again, still pressed against
Blouse’s neck. The silence seemed to last for some time, sharp and drawn
out.

‘That there was some other man called Jackrum,’ said Blouse slowly,
‘whose records have . . . got mixed up with yours and . . . every
attempt to sort it out by officers who were, er, not entirely at home
with figures only made it more confusing.’

The razor started to move again, with silky smoothness. ‘I think you’ve
put your finger right on it, sir,’ said Jackrum.

‘I am going to write an explanatory note and add it to the packet,’
Blouse went on. ‘It seems to me the sensible thing to do would be to ask
you here and now how old you are. How old _are_ you, sergeant?’

‘Forty-three, sir,’ said Jackrum instantly. Polly looked up, expecting
the generic thunderclap that ought to accompany such a universe-sized
untruth.

‘Are you sure?’ said Blouse.

‘Forty-five, sir. The hardships of a soldier’s life show up onna face,
sir.’

‘Even so—’

‘Ah, I recall a couple of extra birthdays what had slipped my memory,
sir. I’m forty-seven, sir.’ Still no rumble of celestial disapproval,
Polly noticed.

‘Er . . . yes. Very well. After all, you should know, eh, sergeant? I
shall amend it.’

‘Thank you, sir.’

‘Just like General Froc did. And Major Galosh. And Colonel Legin,
sergeant.’

‘Yessir. Clerical error has followed me around all the days of my life,
sir. I’ve been a martyr to it.’ Jackrum stood back. ‘There we are, sir.
Face as smooth as a baby’s bum. Smooth is how things should be, eh, sir?
I’ve always liked things smooth.’

They watched Lieutenant Blouse walk down through the trees to the path.
They watched him join the erratic, straggling line of women on their way
to the door. They listened for screams, and heard none.

‘D-does _any_ woman sway that much?’ said Wazzer, peering through the
bushes.

‘Not legally, I think,’ said Polly, scanning the keep with the
lieutenant’s telescope. ‘Well, we’ll just have to wait for some sort of
signal that he’s okay.’

Somewhere overhead, a buzzard screamed.

‘No, they’ll have got him the moment he walked through the door,’ said
Maladict. ‘Bet on it.’

They left Jade on watch. With her paint scraped off, a troll could
settle into rocky scenery so well that no one was likely to notice her
before they walked into her, and by the time they’d walked into her it
was too late.

They made their way back through the woods, and had almost reached the
ruined farmhouse when _it_ happened.

‘You are holding up well, Mal,’ said Polly. ‘Maybe those acorns did the
trick? You haven’t mentioned coffee at all—’

Maladict stopped, and turned slowly. To Polly’s horror, his face was
suddenly shiny with sweat. ‘You had to bring it up, didn’t you?’ he said
hoarsely. ‘Oh, please, no! I was holding on so tight! I was doing so
well!’ He fell forward, but managed to get on to his hands and knees.
Then he raised his head, and his eyes were glowing red. ‘Fetch . . .
Igorina,’ he muttered, gasping. ‘I _know_ she’s ready for this . . .’

. . . _whopwhopwhop_ . . .

Wazzer was praying furiously. Maladict tried to stand up again, fell
back on to his knees, and raised his arms imploringly to the sky.

‘Get out of here while you can,’ he mumbled, as his teeth visibly
lengthened. ‘I’ll—’

There was a shadow, a sense of movement, and the vampire slumped
forward, stunned by an eight-ounce sack of coffee beans that had dropped
out of a clear sky.

Polly arrived at the farmhouse carrying Maladict on her shoulder. She
made him as comfortable as possible on some ancient straw, and the squad
consulted.

‘Do you think we ought to try to take the sack out of his mouth?’ said
Shufti nervously.

‘I tried, but he fights,’ said Polly.

‘But he’s unconscious!’

‘He still won’t let go of it! He’s _sucking_ it. I’d swear he was out
cold, but he just sort of reached out and grabbed it and bit! It dropped
out of a clear sky!’

Tonker stared at Wazzer. ‘The Duchess does room service?’ she said.

‘No! She says she d-didn’t!’

‘You get freak rainth of fish,’ said Igorina, kneeling down by Maladict.
‘I suppose it’s possible that a whirlwind tore through a coffee
plantation, and then possibly a lightning discharge in the upper ether—’

‘At what point did it blow through a factory making small coffee sacks?’
said Tonker. ‘Ones with a jolly turbaned man printed on them apparently
saying “Klatchian Rare Roasted! When a Pickaxe is Not Enough!”’

‘Well, if you’re going to put it like that, it does theem a little
far-fetched . . .’ Igorina stood up, adding, ‘I think he’ll be fine when
he wakes up. Possibly a little talkative, though.’

‘Okay, lads, get some rest,’ said Jackrum, coming in. ‘Let’s give the
rupert a couple of hours to muck things up, and then we can nip around
the valley and slip down and join the rest of the army. Good grub and
proper blankets to sleep on, hey? That’s the ticket!’

‘We don’t know he’s going to mess up, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, yeah, right, maybe he’ll have married the commander of the garrison
by now, eh? Stranger things have happened, although I can’t remember
when. Perks and Manickle, you’re on watch. The rest of you, get some
shut-eye.’

A Zlobenian patrol went past in the distance. Polly watched it out of
sight. It was turning into a fine day, warm with a bit of wind. Good
drying weather. A good day to be a washerwoman. And maybe Blouse would
succeed. Maybe all the guards were blind.

‘Pol?’ Shufti whispered.

‘Yes, Shuf . . . Look, what was your name back in the world?’

‘Betty. It’s Betty. Er . . . most of the Ins-and-Outs are in the keep,
right?’

‘Apparently.’

‘So that’s where I’m most likely to find my fiancé, yes?’

We’ve talked about that, Polly thought. ‘Could be.’

‘Might be quite hard if there’s a lot of men . . .’ said Betty, a woman
with something on her mind.

‘Well, _if_ we get as far as the prisoners and ask around they’ll be
bound to know his name. What is it?’

‘Johnny,’ whispered Betty.

‘Just Johnny?’ said Polly.

‘Er . . . yes . . .’

Ah, Polly thought. I think I know how this goes . . .

‘He’s got fair hair and blue eyes, and I think he had one gold earring,
and . . . and a funny-shaped . . . what d’you call it? Oh, yes . . .
sort of carbuncle on his, his . . . bottom.’

‘Right. Right.’

‘Um . . . now I come to tell someone, it doesn’t sound very helpful, I
suppose.’

Not unless we’re in a position to have a very unusual identity parade,
Polly thought, and I can’t imagine what position that would be.

‘Not as such,’ she said.

‘He said everyone in the regiment knows him,’ Betty went on.

‘Right? Oh, good,’ said Polly. ‘All we need to do is ask.’

‘And, er, we were going to break a sixpence in half, you know, like they
do, so that if he had to be away for years we’d be sure we’d got the
right person ’cos the two halves would match . . .’

‘Oh, that would be a bit of a help, I expect.’

‘Well, yes, except, well, I gave him the sixpence, and he said he’d get
the blacksmith to break it in his vice, and he went off and, er, I think
he got called away . . .’ Betty’s voice trailed off.

Well, that was about what I expected, Polly thought.

‘I expect you think I’m a silly girl,’ mumbled Betty after a while.

‘A foolish woman, perhaps,’ said Polly, turning to watch the landscape
intently.

‘It was, you know, a whirlwind romance . . .’

‘Sounds more like a hurricane to me,’ said Polly, and Betty grinned.

‘Yes, it was a bit like that,’ she said.

Polly matched smile for smile. ‘Betty, it’s daft to talk about silly and
foolish at a time like this,’ she said. ‘Where are we going to look for
wisdom? To a god who hates jigsaws and the colour blue? A fossil
government led by a picture? An army that thinks stubbornness is the
same as courage? Compared to all that, all _you’ve_ got wrong is
timing!’

‘I don’t want to end up in the school, though,’ said Betty. ‘They took
away a girl from our village and she was kicking and screaming—’

‘Then fight them!’ said Polly. ‘You’ve got a sword now, haven’t you?
Fight back!’ She saw the look of horror on Betty’s face, and remembered
that this wasn’t Tonker she was talking to. ‘Look, if we get out of this
alive we’ll talk to the colonel. He might be able to help.’ After all,
perhaps your boy really _was_ called Johnny, she thought, perhaps he
really _was_ called away suddenly. Hope is a wonderful thing. She went
on: ‘If we get out of this there’s going to be no school and no
beatings. Not for you or any of us. Not if we’ve got brains. Not if
we’re smart.’

Betty was almost in tears, but she managed another smile. ‘And Wazzer’s
talking to the Duchess, too. She’ll fix things!’

Polly stared out at the bright, unchanging landscape, empty except for a
buzzard making wide circles in the forbidden blue. ‘I’m not sure about
that,’ she said. ‘But _someone_ up there likes us.’

Twilight was brief at this time of year. There had been no sign from
Blouse.

‘I watched until I couldn’t see,’ said Jade, as they sat and watched
Shufti make stew. ‘Some of der women dat came out was ones I saw goin’
in dis mornin’, too.’

‘Are you sure?’ said Jackrum.

‘We might be fick, sarge,’ said Jade, looking hurt, ‘but trolls have
great . . . er . . . vis-you-all ack-you-it-tee. More women was going in
dis evenin’, too.’

‘Night shift,’ said Tonker.

‘Oh well, he tried,’ said Jackrum. ‘With any luck he’s in a nice warm
cell and they’ve found him a pair of long pants. Get your kit together,
lads. We’ll creep around and into our lines and you’ll be snug in bed by
midnight.’

Polly remembered what she’d said, hours ago, about fighting. You had to
start somewhere. ‘I want to try the keep again,’ she said.

‘You do, Perks, do you?’ said Jackrum, with mock interest.

‘My brother’s in there.’

‘Nice safe place for him, then.’

‘He might be injured. I vote for the keep.’

‘Vote?’ said Jackrum. ‘My word, that’s a new one. Voting in the army?
Who wants to get killed, lads, let’s have a show of hands? Knock it off,
Perks.’

‘I’m going to try it, sarge!’

‘You are not!’

‘_Try and stop me!_’ The words came out before she could stop them. And
that’s it, she thought, the shout heard round the world. No going back
after _this_. I’ve run off the edge of the cliff and it’s all downhill
from here.

Jackrum’s expression stayed blank for a second or two, and then he said,
‘Anyone else _voting_ for the keep?’

Polly looked at Shufti, who blushed.

But: ‘We are,’ said Tonker. Beside her, Lofty struck a match, and held
it so that it flared. That was pretty much a speech from Lofty.

‘Why, pray?’ said Jackrum.

‘We don’t want to sit around in a swamp,’ said Tonker. ‘And we don’t
like being ordered around.’

‘Should have thought of that before you joined an army, lad!’

‘We aren’t lads, sarge.’

‘You are if I says you are!’

Well, it’s not as though I wasn’t expecting it, Polly thought. I’ve
played this out enough times in my head. Here goes . . . ‘All right,
sarge,’ she said. ‘It’s time to have it out, here and now.’

‘Ooo, er,’ said Jackrum theatrically, fishing his screwed-up paper of
tobacco out of his pocket.

‘What?’

Jackrum sat down on the remains of a wall. ‘Just injecting a little
sauciness into the conversation,’ he said. ‘Carry on, Perks. Have your
say. I thought it’d come to this.’

‘You know I’m a woman, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘Yup. I wouldn’t trust you to shave cheese.’

The squad stared. Jackrum opened his big knife and examined the chewing
tobacco as though it was the most interesting thing present.

‘So . . . er . . . what are you going to do about it?’ said Polly,
feeling derailed.

‘Dunno. Can’t do anything, can I? You were born like it.’

‘You didn’t tell Blouse!’ said Polly.

‘Nope.’

Polly wanted to knock the wretched tobacco out of the sergeant’s hand.
Now that she had got over the surprise, there was something _offensive_
about this lack of reaction. It was like someone opening a door just
before your battering ram hit it; suddenly you were running through the
building and not certain how to stop.

‘Well, we’re _all_ women, sarge,’ said Tonker. ‘How about that?’

Jackrum sawed at the tobacco.

‘So?’ he said, still paying attention to the job in hand.

‘What?’ said Polly.

‘Think no one else ever tried it? Think you’re the only ones? Think your
ol’ sarge is deaf, blind and stupid? You could fool one another and
anyone can fool a rupert, but you can’t fool Jackrum. Weren’t sure about
Maladict and still ain’t, because with a vampire, who knows? And not
sure about you, Carborundum, because with a troll, who cares? No
offence.’

‘None taken,’ rumbled Jade. She caught Polly’s eye and shrugged.

‘Not so good at reading the signs, not knowing many trolls,’ said the
sergeant. ‘I had _you_ down pat in the first minute, Ozz. Something in
the eyes, I reckon. Like . . . you were watching to see how good you
were.’

Oh _hell_, Polly thought. ‘Er . . . do I have a pair of socks belonging
to you?’

‘Yep. Well washed, I might add.’

‘You’ll have them back right now!’ said Polly, grabbing for her belt.

‘In your own time, Perks, in your own time, no rush,’ said Jackrum,
raising a hand. ‘Well washed, please.’

‘_Why_, sarge?’ said Tonker. ‘Why didn’t you give us away? You could’ve
given us away any time!’

Jackrum slewed his wad from cheek to cheek and sat chewing for a while,
staring at nothing.

‘No, you ain’t the first,’ he said. ‘I’ve seen a few. Mostly by
themselves, always frightened . . . and mostly they didn’t last long.
But one or two of them were bonny soldiers, very bonny soldiers indeed.
So I looked at you lot and I thought to myself, well now, I thought, I
wonder how they’ll do when they find out they’re not alone? You know
about lions?’ They nodded. ‘Well, the lion is a big ol’ coward, mostly.
If you want trouble, you want to tangle with the lioness. They’re
killers, and they hunt together. It’s the same everywhere. If you want
big grief, look to the ladies. Even with insects, right? There’s a kind
of beetle where _she_ bites _his_ head off right while he’s exercisin’
his conjugals, and that’s what I call serious grief. On the other hand,
from what I heard he carries on regardless, so maybe it’s not the same
for beetles.’

He looked around at their blank expressions. ‘No?’ he said. ‘Well, maybe
I thought, a whole bunch of girls all at once, that’s . . . strange.
Maybe there’s a reason.’ Polly saw him glance briefly at Wazzer.
‘Anyway, I wasn’t goin’ to shame you all in front of a little toad like
Strappi, and then there was all that business in Plotz, and then, well,
we was gallopin’, as it were, caught up in things with no time to get
off. You did well, lads. Very well. Shaped up like good ’uns.’

‘I’m going into the keep,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, don’t worry about the rupert,’ said Jackrum. ‘Probably he’s
enjoying a nice bowl of scubbo right now. He went to a school for young
gentlemen, so prison will be just like old times.’

‘We’re still going, sarge. Sorry,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, don’t say _sorry_, Perks, you were doing well up ’til then,’ said
Jackrum bitterly.

Shufti stood up. ‘I’m going too,’ she said. ‘I think my . . . fiancé is
in there.’

‘I have to go,’ said Wazzer. ‘The Duchess guides my steps.’

‘I’ll go, then,’ said Igorina. ‘I’m probably going to be needed.’

‘I shouldn’t fink I could get by as a washerwoman,’ rumbled Jade. ‘I’ll
stay here and watch over Mal. Hah, if he’s still after blood when he
wakes up he’s gonna have blunt teeth!’

They looked at one another in silence, embarrassed but defiant. Then
there was the sound of someone clapping, slowly.

‘Oh, very nice,’ said Jackrum. ‘A band of brothers, eh? Sorry . . .
sisters. Oh dear, oh dear. Look, Blouse was a fool. It was prob’ly all
them books. He read all that stuff about it being a noble thing to die
for your country, I expect. I was never that keen on readin’, but I
_know_ the job is making some other poor devil die for his.’

He slewed his black tobacco from side to side. ‘I wanted you to be safe,
lads. Down in the press of men, I reckoned I could get you through this,
no matter how many friends the Prince has sent after you. I look at you
lads, and I think: you poor boys, you don’t know nothin’ about war. What
you goin’ to _do_? Tonker, you are a crack shot, but after one shot
who’s backing you up while you reload? Perks, you know a trick or two,
but the blokes in the castle will maybe know a trick or five. You’re a
good cook, Shufti; too bad it’s going to be too hot in there. Will the
Duchess turn aside arrows, Wazzer?’

‘_Yes. She will_.’

‘I hope you are right, my lad,’ said Jackrum, giving the girl a long
slow look. ‘Pers’nally, I’ve found religion in battle is as much use as
a chocolate helmet. You’ll need more than a prayer if Prince Heinrich
catches you, I might add.’

‘We’re going to try it, sarge,’ said Polly. ‘There’s nothing for us in
the army.’

‘Will you come with us, sarge?’ said Shufti.

‘No, lad. Me as a washerwoman? I doubt it. Don’t seem to have a skirt
anywhere about me, for a start. Er . . . just one thing, lads. How are
you going to get in?’

‘In the morning. When we see the women going in again,’ said Polly.

‘Got it all planned, general? And you’ll be dressed as women?’

‘Er . . . we _are_ women, sarge,’ said Polly.

‘Yes, lad. Technical detail. But you kitted out the rupert with all your
little knick-knacks, didn’t you? What’re you going to do, tell the
guards you opened the wrong cupboard in the dark?’

Another embarrassed silence descended. Jackrum sighed. ‘This ain’t
proper war,’ he said. ‘Still, I said I’d look after you. You are my
little lads, I said.’ His eyes gleamed. ‘And you still are, even if the
world’s turned upside down. I’ll just have to hope, Miss Perks, that you
picked up a few tricks from ol’ sarge, although I reckon you can think
of a few of your own. And now I’d better get you kitted up, right?’

‘Perhaps we could sneak in and steal something from the villages where
the servants come from?’ said Tonker.

‘From a bunch of poor women?’ said Polly, her heart sinking. ‘Anyway,
there’d be soldiers everywhere.’

‘Well, how do we get women’s clothes on a battlefield?’ said Lofty.

Jackrum laughed, stood up, stuck his thumbs in his belt and grinned. ‘I
_told_ you, lads, you don’t know _nuffin’_ about war!’ he said.

. . . and one of the things they hadn’t known was that it has edges.

Polly wasn’t certain what she’d expected. Men and horses, obviously. In
her mind’s eye they were engaged in mortal combat, but you couldn’t go
on doing that all day. So there would be tents. And that was about as
far as the mind’s eye had seen. It hadn’t seen that an army on campaign
is a sort of large, portable city. It has only one employer, and it
manufactures dead people, but like all cities it attracts . . .
citizens. What was unnerving was the sound of babies crying, off in the
rows of tents. She hadn’t expected that. Or the mud. Or the _crowds_.
Everywhere there were fires, and the smell of cooking. This was a siege,
after all. People had settled in.

Getting down on to the plain in the dark had been easy. There was only
Polly and Shufti trailing after the sergeant, who’d said that more would
be too many and in any case would show up. There were patrols, but their
edge had been dulled by sheer repetitiveness. Besides, the allies
weren’t expecting anyone to make much effort to get into the valley, at
least in small groups. And men in the dark make a noise, far more noise
than a woman. They’d located a Borogravian sentry in the gloom by the
noise of him trying to suck a morsel of dinner out of his teeth. But
another one had located them when they were a stone’s throw from the
tents. He was young, so he was still keen.

‘Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe!’ The light from a cooking-fire
glinted off a crossbow.

‘See?’ whispered Jackrum. ‘This is where your uniform is your friend.
Aren’t you glad you kept it?’

He swaggered forward, and spat tobacco between the young sentry’s boots.
‘My name’s Jackrum,’ he said. ‘That’s Sergeant Jackrum. As for the other
bit . . . _you_ choose.’

‘Sergeant Jackrum?’ said the boy, his mouth staying open.

‘Yes, lad.’

‘What, the one who killed sixteen men at the Battle of Zop?’

‘There was only ten of ’em, but good lad for knowin’ it.’

‘The Jackrum who carried General Froc through fourteen miles of enemy
territory?’

‘That’s right.’

Polly saw teeth in the gloom as the sentry grinned. ‘My dad told me he
fought with you at Blunderberg!’

‘Ah, that was a hot battle, that was!’ said Jackrum.

‘No, he meant in the pub afterwards. He pinched your drink and you
smacked him in the mouth and he kicked you in the nadgers and you hit
him in the guts and he blacked your eye and then you hit him with a
table and when he came round his mates stood him beer for the evening
for managing to lay nearly three punches on Sergeant Jackrum. He tells
the story every year, when it’s the anniversary and he’s pis—
reminiscing.’

Jackrum thought for a moment, and then jabbed a finger at the young man.
‘Joe Hubukurk, right?’ he said.

The smile broadened to the point where the top of the young man’s head
was in danger of falling off. ‘He’ll be smirking all day when I tell him
you remember him, sarge! He says that where you piss grass don’t grow!’

‘Well, what can a modest man say to that, eh?’ said Jackrum.

Then the young man frowned. ‘Funny, though, he thought you were dead,
sarge,’ he said.

‘Tell him I bet him a shilling I’m not,’ said Jackrum. ‘And your name,
lad?’

‘Lart, sarge. Lart Hubukurk.’

‘Glad you joined, are you?’

‘Yes, sarge,’ said Lart loyally.

‘We’re just having a stroll, lad. Tell your dad I asked after him.’

‘I will, sarge!’ The boy stood to attention like a one-man guard of
honour. ‘This is a proud moment for me, sarge!’

‘Does _everyone_ know you, sarge?’ whispered Polly, as they walked away.

‘Aye, pretty much. On our side, anyway. I’ll make so bold as to declare
that most of the enemy that meets me don’t know anything much
afterwards.’

‘I never thought it was going to be like this!’ hissed Shufti.

‘Like what?’ said Jackrum.

‘There’s women and children! Shops! I can smell bread baking! It’s like
a . . . a city.’

‘Yeah, but what we’re after isn’t going to be in the main streets.
Follow me, lads.’ Sergeant Jackrum, suddenly furtive, ducked between two
big heaps of boxes and emerged beside a smithy, its forge glowing in the
dusk.

Here the tents were open-sided. Armourers and saddlers worked by
lantern-light, shadows flickering across the mud. Polly and Shufti had
to step out of the way of a mule train, each animal carrying two casks
on its back; the mules moved aside for Jackrum. _Maybe he’s met them
before, too_, thought Polly, _maybe he really_ does _know everyone_.

The sergeant walked like a man with the deeds to the world. He
acknowledged other sergeants with a nod, lazily saluted the few officers
there were around here, and ignored everybody else.

‘You been here before, sarge?’ said Shufti.

‘No, lad.’

‘But you know where you’re going?’

‘Correct. I ain’t been _here_, but I know battlefields, especially when
everyone’s had a chance to dig in.’ Jackrum sniffed the air. ‘Ah, right.
That’s the stuff. Just you two wait here.’

He disappeared between two stacks of lumber. They heard a distant
muttering and, after a moment or two, he reappeared holding a small
bottle.

Polly grinned. ‘Is that rum, sarge?’

‘Well done, my little bar steward. And wouldn’t it be nice if it _was_
rum, upon my word. Or whisky or gin or brandy. But this don’t have none
of those fancy names. This is the genuine stingo, this is. Pure
hangman.’

‘Hangman?’ said Shufti.

‘One drop and you’re dead,’ said Polly. Jackrum beamed, as a master to a
keen pupil.

‘That’s right, Shufti. It’s rotgut. Wheresoever men are gathered
together, someone will find something to ferment in a rubber boot,
distil in an old kettle and flog to his mates. Made from rats, by the
smell of it. Ferments well, does your average rat. Fancy a taste?’

Shufti shied away from the proffered bottle. The sergeant laughed. ‘Good
lad. Stick to beer,’ he said.

‘Don’t the officers stop it?’ said Polly.

‘Officers? What do they know about anything?’ said Jackrum. ‘An’ I
bought this off of a sergeant, too. Anyone watching us?’

Polly peered into the gloom. ‘No, sarge.’

Jackrum poured some of the liquid into one pudgy hand and splashed it on
to his face. ‘Ye-ouch,’ he hissed. ‘Stings like the blazes. And now to
kill the tooth worms. Got to do the job properly.’ He took a quick sip
from the bottle, spat it out, and shoved the cork back in. ‘Muck,’ he
said. ‘Okay, let’s go.’

‘Where are we going, sarge?’ said Shufti. ‘You can tell us now, can’t
you?’

‘A quiet little place where our needs will be met,’ said Jackrum. ‘It’ll
be around here somewhere.’

‘You don’t half smell of drink, sarge,’ said Shufti. ‘Will they let you
in if you smell drunk?’

‘Yes, Shufti, lad, they will,’ said Jackrum, setting off again. ‘The
reason being, my pockets jingle and I smell of booze. Everyone likes a
rich drunk. Ah . . . down this little valley here, that’ll be our . . .
yeah, I was right. This is the place. Tucked away, _delicate_ like. See
any clothes hanging out to dry, boys?’

There were a few washing lines strung behind the half-dozen or so drab
tents in this side valley, which was little more than a wash gouged out
by winter rains. If there had been anything on them it had been taken in
against the heavy dew.

‘Shame,’ said Jackrum. ‘Okay, so we’ll have to do it the hard way.
Remember: just act natural and listen to what I say.’

‘I’m sh-shaking, sarge,’ Shufti muttered.

‘Good, good, very natural,’ said Jackrum. ‘This is our place, I think.
Nice and quiet, no one watching us, nice little path up there to the top
of the wash . . .’ He stopped at a very large tent and tapped on the
board outside with his swagger stick.

‘The SoLid DoVes,’ Polly read.

‘Yeah, well, these ladies weren’t hired for their spelling,’ said
Jackrum, pushing open the flap of the tent of ill repute.

Inside was a stuffy little area, a sort of canvas antechamber. A lady,
lumpy and crowlike in a black bombazine dress, rose from a chair and
gave the trio the most calculating look Polly had ever met. It finished
off by putting a price on her boots.

The sergeant doffed his cap and in a jovial, rotund voice that peed
brandy and crapped plum pudding said, ‘Good evening, mad_arm_! Sergeant
Smith’s the name, yes indeed! An’ me and my bold lads here have been so
fortunate as to acquire the spoils of war, if you catch my drift, and
nothing would do for it but they were clamouring, _clamouring_ to go to
the nearest house of good repute for to have a man made of ’em!’

Little beady eyes skewered Polly again. Shufti, ears glowing like signal
beacons, was staring fixedly at the ground.

‘Looks like that’d be a job and a half,’ said the woman shortly.

‘You never spoke a truer word, madarm!’ beamed Jackrum. ‘Two of your
fair flowers apiece should do it, I reckon.’ There was a clink as,
staggering slightly, Jackrum put several gold coins on the rickety
little table.

Something about the gleam of them thawed things no end. The woman’s face
cracked into a smile as glutinous as slug gravy.

‘Well now, we are always honoured to entertain the Ins-and-Outs,
sergeant,’ she said. ‘If you . . . gentlemen would like to step through
to the, er, inner sanctum?’

Polly heard a very faint sound behind her, and turned. She hadn’t
noticed the man sitting on a chair just inside the door. He had to be a
man, because trolls weren’t pink; he made Eyebrow back in Plün look like
some kind of weed. He wore leather, which was what she’d heard creaking,
and he had his eyes just slightly open. When he saw her looking at him,
he winked. It wasn’t a friendly wink.

There are times when a plan suddenly isn’t going to work. When you’re in
the middle of it is not the time to find this out.

‘Er, sarge,’ she said. The sergeant turned, saw her frantic grimace, and
appeared to spot the guard for the first time.

‘Oh _dear_, where’s my manners?’ he said, lurching back and fumbling in
his pocket. He came up with a gold coin which he folded in the
astonished man’s hand. Then he turned round, tapping the side of his
nose with an expression of idiot knowingness.

‘A word of advice, lads,’ he said. ‘Always give the guard a tip. He
keeps the riff-riff-raff out, very important. Very important man.’

He stumbled back to the lady in black, and belched hugely. ‘And now,
mad_arm_, if we can meet these visions of loveliness you are hiding
under this here bushel?’ he said.

It depended, Polly thought a few seconds later, on how and when and
after drinking how much of what whether you had those visions. She
_knew_ about these places. Serving behind a bar can really broaden your
education. There were a number of ladies back home who were, as her
mother put it, ‘no better than they should be’, and at twelve years old
Polly had got a slap for asking how good they should have been, then.
They were an Abomination unto Nuggan, but men have always found space in
their religion for a little sinning here and there.

The word to describe the four ladies seated in the room beyond, if you
wanted to be kind, was ‘tired’. If you didn’t want to be kind a whole
range of words were just hanging in the air.

They looked up without much interest.

‘This is Faith, Prudence, Grace and Comfort,’ said the lady of the
house. ‘The night shift has not yet come on, I’m afraid.’

‘I’m sure these beauties will be a great education for my roaring boys,’
said the sergeant. ‘But . . . may I be so bold as to enquire about your
name, mad_arm_?’

‘I’m Mrs Smother, sergeant.’

‘And do you have a first name, may I ask?’

‘Dolores,’ said Mrs Smother, ‘to my . . . special friends.’

‘Well now, Dolores,’ said Jackrum, and there was another jingle of coins
in his pocket, ‘I will come right out with it and be frank, because I
can see you are a woman of the world. These frail blossoms are all very
well in their way, for I know the fashion these days is for ladies with
less meat on ’em than a butcher’s pencil, but a gentleman such as me,
who has been around the world and seen a thing or two, well, he learns
the value of . . . maturity.’ He sighed. ‘Not to mention Hope and
Patience.’ The coins jingled again. ‘Perhaps you and I might retire to
some suitable boodwah, mad_arm_, and discuss the matter over a cordial
or two?’

Mrs Smother looked from the sergeant to the ‘lads’, glanced back in the
anteroom, and looked back at Jackrum with her head on one side and a
thin, calculating smile on her lips.

‘Ye-es,’ she said. ‘You’re a fine figure of a man, Sergeant Smith. Let
us take a load off your . . . pockets, shall we?’

She joined arm-in-arm with the sergeant, who winked roguishly at Polly
and Shufti. ‘We’re well set, then, lads!’ he chuckled. ‘Now, just so’s
you don’t get carried away, when it’s time to go I’ll blow my whistle
and you better finish what you’re doin’, haha, and meet me sharpish.
Duty calls! Remember the fine tradition of the Ins-and Outs!’ Giggling
and almost tripping up, he left the room on the arm of the proprietress.

Shufti sidled hurriedly up to Polly and whispered: ‘Is sarge all right,
Ozzer?’

‘He’s just had a bit too much to drink,’ said Polly loudly, as all four
of the girls stood up.

‘But he—’ Shufti got a nudge in the ribs before she could say any more.
One of the girls carefully laid down her knitting, took Polly’s arm,
flashed her finely crafted expression of interest and said, ‘You’re a
well-set-up young man, aren’t you . . . what’s your name, dear? I’m
Gracie.’

‘Oliver,’ said Polly. And what the _hell_ is the fine tradition of the
Ins-and-Outs?

‘Ever seen a woman with no clothes on before, Oliver?’ The girls
giggled.

Polly’s brow wrinkled as, just for a moment, she was caught unawares.
‘Yes,’ she said. ‘Of course.’

‘Ooo, it looks like we’ve got ourselves a regular Don Joo-ann, girls,’
said Gracie, stepping back. ‘We may have to send out for reinforcements!
Why don’t you an’ me and Prudence go off to a little nook I know, and
your little friend will be the guest of Faith and Comfort. Comfort’s
very good with young men, ain’t you, Comfort?’

Sergeant Jackrum had been wrong in his description of the girls. Three
of them were indeed several meals short of a healthy weight, but when
Comfort got up out of her large armchair you realized that it had, in
fact, been quite a small armchair and had mostly been Comfort. For a
large woman she had a small face, locked in a piggy-eyed scowl. There
was a death’s head tattoo on one arm.

‘He’s young,’ said Gracie. ‘He’ll heal. Come along, Don Joo-ann . . .’

In a way, Polly was relieved. She didn’t take to the girls. Oh, the
profession could bring anyone down, but she’d got to know some of her
town’s ladies of uneasy virtue and they had an edge she couldn’t find
here.

‘Why do you work here?’ she said, as they entered a smaller,
canvas-walled room. There was a rickety bed taking up most of the space.

‘You know, you look a bit too young to be _that_ sort of customer,’ said
Gracie.

‘What sort?’ said Polly.

‘Oh, a holy joe,’ said Gracie. ‘“What’s a girl like you doing in a place
like this?” and all that stuff. Feel sorry for us, do you? At least if
someone cuts up rough we’ve got Garry outside and after he’s finished
with the bloke the colonel gets told and the bastard gets bunged in
clink.’

‘Yeah,’ said Prudence. ‘From what we hear we’re the safest ladies within
twenty-five miles. Old Smother’s not too bad. We get money to keep and
we get fed and she don’t beat us, which is more than can be said for
husbands, and you can’t wander around loose, now, can you?’

Jackrum put up with Blouse because you’ve got to have an officer, Polly
thought. If you don’t have an officer, some other officer’ll take you
over. And a woman by herself is missing a man, while a man by himself is
his own master. Trousers. That’s the secret. Trousers and a pair of
socks. I never dreamed it was like this. Put on trousers and the world
changes. We walk different. We act different. I see these girls and I
think: idiots! Get yourself some trousers!

‘Can you please get your clothes off ?’ she said. ‘I think we’d better
hurry.’

‘One of the Ins-and-Outs, this one,’ said Gracie, slipping her dress off
her shoulders. ‘Keep an eye on your cheeses, Pru!’

‘Er . . . why does that mean we’re in the Ins-and-Outs?’ said Polly. She
made a show of unbuttoning her jacket, wishing that she believed in
anyone there to pray to so that she could pray for the whistle.

‘That’s ’cos you lads always have your eye on business,’ said Gracie.

And maybe there was someone listening, at that. The whistle blew.

Polly grabbed the dresses and ran out, oblivious of the yells behind
her. She collided with Shufti outside, tripped over the groaning form of
Garry, saw Sergeant Jackrum holding the tent flap open, and bulleted
into the night.

‘This way!’ the sergeant hissed, grabbing her by the collar before she’d
gone a few feet and swinging her round. ‘You too, Shufti! Move!’

He ran up the side of the wash like a child’s balloon being blown by the
wind, leaving them to scramble after him. His arms were full of
clothing, which snagged and danced behind him. Up above was knee-deep
scrub, treacherous in the gloom. They tripped and staggered across it
until they reached heavier growth, whereupon the sergeant got hold of
both of them and pushed them into the bushes. The shouts and screams
were fainter now.

‘Now we’ll just keep quiet, like,’ he whispered. ‘There’s patrols
about.’

‘They’ll be bound to find us,’ Polly hissed, while Shufti wheezed.

‘No, they won’t,’ said Jackrum. ‘First, they’ll all be running towards
the shoutin’, because that’s natur— there they go . . .’ Polly heard
more shouts in the distance. ‘And bloody fools they are, too. They’re
supposed to be guarding the perimeter, and they’re running towards
trouble in the camp. _And_ they’re running straight towards lamplight,
so there goes their night eyes! If I was their sergeant they’d be due a
fizzer! C’mon.’ He stood up, and hauled Shufti to her feet. ‘Feeling all
right, lad?’

‘It w-was horrible, sarge! One of them put her hand . . . on . . . on my
socks!’

‘Something that doesn’t often happen, I’ll bet any man,’ said Jackrum.
‘But you did a good job. Now, we’ll walk nice and quiet, and no more
talking ’til I say, okay?’

They plodded on for ten minutes, skirting the camp. They heard several
patrols, and saw a couple of others on the hilltops as the moon rose,
but it dawned on Polly that, loud though the shouting had been, it was
only part of the huge patchwork of sound that rose from the camp. The
patrols this far away probably hadn’t heard it, or at least were
commanded by the kinds of soldiers who didn’t want to get put on a
fizzer.

In the dark, she heard Jackrum take a deep breath. ‘Okay, that’s far
enough. Not a bad job of work, lads. You’re real Ins-and-Outs now!’

‘That guard was out cold,’ said Polly. ‘Did you hit him?’

‘Y’see, I’m fat,’ said Jackrum. ‘People don’t think fat men can fight.
They think fat men are funny. They think wrong. Gave ’im a chop to the
windpipe.’

‘Sarge!’ said Shufti, horrified.

‘What? What? He was coming at me with his club!’ said Jackrum.

‘_Why_ was he doing that, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Ooh, you cunning soldier, you,’ said Jackrum. ‘All right, I grant you
that I’d just given madarm the ol’ quietus, but to be fair I know when
someone’s just handed me a bleedin’ drink full o’ sleepy drops.’

‘You hit a _woman_, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, and maybe when she wakes up in her corsets she’ll decide that
next time a poor ol’ drunk fat man wanders in it mightn’t be such a good
idea to try to roll him for his wad,’ growled Jackrum. ‘I’d be in a
ditch wi’out my drawers on and a damned great headache if she’d had her
way, and if you two was daft enough to complain to an officer she’d
swear black was blue that I didn’t have a penny on me when I came in and
was drunk and disorderly. And the colonel wouldn’t care a fig, ’cos he’d
reckon a sergeant daft enough to get caught like that had it coming to
him. I _know_, you see. I look after my lads.’ There was a clink in the
dark. ‘Plus a few extra dollars won’t go amiss.’

‘Sarge, you didn’t steal the cashbox, did you?’ said Polly.

‘Yeah. Got a good armful of her wardrobe, too.’

‘Good!’ said Shufti fervently. ‘It wasn’t a nice place!’

‘It was mostly my money in any case,’ said Jackrum. ‘Business has been a
bit slow today, by the feel of it.’

‘But it’s immoral earnings!’ said Polly, and then felt a complete fool
for saying it.

‘No,’ said Jackrum. ‘It _was_ immoral earnings, _now_ it’s the proceeds
of common theft. Life’s a lot easier when you learns to think straight.’

Polly was glad there was no mirror. The best that could be said for the
squad’s new clothing was that it covered them up. But this was a war.
You seldom saw new clothes on anybody. Yet they felt awkward. And there
was no sense in that at all. But they looked at one another in the
chilly light of dawn and giggled in embarrassment. Wow, Polly thought,
look at us: dressed as _women_!

Oddly enough, it was Igorina who really looked the part. She’d
disappeared into the other tumbledown room carrying her pack. For ten
minutes the squad had heard the occasional grunt or ‘ouch’, and then
she’d returned with a full head of fair, shoulder-length hair. Her face
was the right shape, missing the lumps and bumps they’d come to know.
And the stitches on her forehead shrank and _disappeared_ as Polly
watched in astonishment.

‘Doesn’t that _hurt_?’ she said.

‘It smarts a bit for a few minutes,’ said Igorina. ‘You just have to
have the knack. And the special ointment, of course.’

‘But why’s there a curved scar on your cheek now?’ said Tonker. ‘And
_those_ stitches are staying.’

Igorina looked down demurely. She’d even restyled one of the dresses
into a dirndl, and looked like a fresh young maid from the beer cellar.
Just to look at her was to mentally order a large pretzel.

‘You’ve got to have _something_ to show,’ she said. ‘Otherwise you’re
letting down the clan. And actually I think the stitches are rather
fetching . . .’

‘Well, okay,’ Tonker conceded. ‘But lisp a bit, will you? I know this is
completely wrong, but now you look, oh, I don’t know . . . weird, I
suppose.’

‘Okay, line up,’ said Jackrum. He stood back, and gave them a look of
theatrical disdain. ‘Well, I’ve never seen such a lot of scrubb—
washerwomen in all my life,’ he said. ‘I wish you all the luck you’re
bleeding well gonna need. There’ll be someone watching the door for you
to come out, and that’s all I can promise. Private Perks, you’re acting,
unpaid corporal on this one. I hope you’ve picked up one or two little
lessons on our stroll. In and out, that’s what you should do. No famous
last stands, please. When in doubt, kick ’em in the nadgers and scarper.
Mind you, if you frighten them like you frighten me, you should have no
trouble.’

‘Are you sure you won’t join us, sarge?’ said Tonker, still trying not
to laugh.

‘No, lad. You won’t get me in skirts. Everyone has their place, right?
The place where they draw the line? Well, that’s mine. I’m pretty
steeped in sin, one way and another, but Jackrum always shows his
colours. I’m an old soldier. I’ll fight like a soldier does, in the
ranks, on the battlefield. Besides, if I went in there simpering in
petticoats I’d never hear the end of it.’

‘The Duchess says there is a d-different path for Sergeant Jackrum,’
said Wazzer.

‘And I don’t know if you don’t frighten me worst of all, Private Goom,’
said Jackrum. He hitched up his equatorial belt. ‘You’re right, though.
When you’re inside I shall nip down, nice and quiet, and slip into our
lines. If I can’t raise a little diversionary attack, my name’s not
Sergeant Jackrum. And since it _is_ Sergeant Jackrum, that proves it.
Hah, there’s plenty of men in this man’s army that owe me a favour’ – he
gave a little sniff – ‘or wouldn’t say no to my face. And plenty of
likely lads who’ll want to tell their grandchildren they fought
alongside Jackrum, too. Well, I’ll give ’em their chance at real
soldierin’.’

‘Sarge, it’ll be suicide to attack the main gates!’ said Polly.

Jackrum slapped his belly. ‘See this lot?’ he said. ‘It’s like having
yer own armour. Bloke once stuck a blade in this up to the hilt and was
as surprised as hell when I nutted him. Anyway, you lads’ll be making so
much fuss the guards will be distracted, right? You’re relying on me,
I’m relying on you. That’s milit’ry, that is. You give me a signal, any
signal. That’s all I’ll need.’

‘The Duchess says your path takes you further,’ said Wazzer.

‘Oh yeah?’ said Jackrum jovially. ‘And where’s that, then? Somewhere
with a good pub, I hope!’

‘The Duchess says, um, it should lead to the town of Scritz,’ said
Wazzer. She said it quietly while the rest of the squad were laughing,
less at the comment than as a way of losing some of the tension. But
Polly heard it.

Jackrum really, really was good, she thought. The fleeting expression of
terror was gone in an instant. ‘Scritz? Nothing there,’ he said. ‘Dull
town.’

‘There was a sword,’ said Wazzer.

Jackrum was ready this time. There was not a flicker of expression, just
the blank face that he was so good at. And that was odd, Polly thought,
because there should have been something, even if it was only
puzzlement.

‘Handled lots of swords in my time,’ he said dismissively. ‘Yes, Private
Halter?’

‘There’s one thing you didn’t tell us, sarge,’ said Tonker, lowering her
hand. ‘Why is the regiment _called_ the Ins-and-Outs?’

‘First into battle, last out of the fray,’ said Jackrum automatically.

‘So why are we nicknamed the Cheesemongers?’

‘Yes,’ said Shufti. ‘Why, sarge? Because the way those girls were
talking, it sounded like it’s something we ought to know.’

Jackrum made a clicking noise of exasperation. ‘Oh, Tonker, why the hell
did you wait ’til you’d got your trousers off before asking me that?
I’ll feel embarrassed telling yer now!’ And Polly thought: that’s bait,
right? You want to tell us. You want to get any conversation away from
Scritz . . .

‘Ah,’ said Tonker. ‘It’s about sex, then, is it?’

‘Not as such, no . . .’

‘Well, tell me, then,’ said Tonker. ‘I’d like to know before I die. If
it makes you feel any better I’ll nudge people and go _gnher, gnher,
gnher_.’

Jackrum sighed. ‘There’s a song,’ he said. ‘It starts ’_Twas on a Monday
morning, all in the month of May_—’

‘Then it _is_ about sex,’ said Polly flatly. ‘It’s a folk song, it
starts with ’twas, it takes place in May, QED it’s about sex. Is a
milkmaid involved? I bet there is.’

‘There could be,’ Jackrum conceded.

‘Going for to market? For to sell her wares?’ said Polly.

‘Very likely.’

‘O-kay. That gives us the cheese. And she meets, let’s see, a soldier, a
sailor, a jolly ploughboy or just possibly a man clothèd all in leather,
I expect? No, since it’s about us, it’ll be a soldier, right? And since
it’s one of the Ins-and-Outs . . . oh dear, I feel a humorous
double-entendre coming on. Just one question: what item of her clothing
fell down or came untied?’

‘Her garter,’ said Jackrum. ‘You’ve heard it before, Perks.’

‘No, but I just _know_ how folk songs go. We had folk singers in the
lower bar for six months back hom— where I worked. In the end we had to
get a man in with a ferret. But you remember stuff . . . oh, no . . .’

‘Was there canoodling, sarge?’ said Tonker, grinning.

‘Kayaking, I expect,’ said Igorina, to general sniggering.

‘No, he stole the cheese, didn’t he?’ sighed Polly. ‘As the poor girl
was lying there waiting for her garter to be tied, _hem hem_, he damn
well made off with her cheese, right?’

‘Er . . . not damn. Not with the skirt on, Ozz,’ Tonker warned.

‘Then it’s not Ozz, either,’ said Polly. ‘Fill yer hat with bread, fill
yer boots with soup! And steal the cheese, eh, sarge?’

‘That’s right. We’ve always been a very practical regiment,’ said
Jackrum. ‘An army marches on its stomach, lads. On mine, o’ course, it
could troop the colour!’

‘It was her own fault. She should have been able to tie up her own
garters,’ said Lofty.

‘Yeah. Probably _wanted_ her cheese stolen,’ said Tonker.

‘Wise words,’ said Jackrum. ‘Off you go, then . . . cheesemongers!’

The mist was still thick as they made their way down through the woods
to the path by the river. Polly’s skirt kept catching in brambles. It
must have done so before she’d joined up, but she’d never noticed it so
much. Now it was seriously hindering her. She reached up and
absent-mindedly adjusted the socks, which she’d separated to use as
padding elsewhere. She was too skinny, that was the trouble. The
ringlets had been useful there. They said ‘girl’. In their absence, she
had to rely on a scarf and a socks change.

‘All right,’ she whispered, as the ground levelled out. ‘Remember, no
swearing. Giggle, don’t snigger. No belching. No weapons, either. They
can’t be that stupid in there. Anyone brought a weapon?’

There was a shaking of heads.

‘Did you bring a weapon, Tonk— Magda?’

‘No, Polly.’

‘No item of any sort with a certain weapon-like quality?’ Polly
insisted.

‘No, Polly,’ said Tonker demurely.

‘Anything, perhaps, with an edge?’

‘Oh, you mean this?’

‘Yes, Magda.’

‘Well, a woman can carry a knife, can’t she?’

‘It’s a _sabre_, Magda. You’re trying to hide it, but it’s a sabre.’

‘But I’m only using it like a knife, Polly.’

‘It’s three feet long, Magda.’

‘Size isn’t important, Polly.’

‘No one believes that. Leave it behind a tree, please. That is an
order.’

‘Oh, all right!’

After a while, Shufti, who had appeared to be thinking deeply, said: ‘I
can’t understand why she didn’t just tie up her own garter . . .’

‘Shuft, what the hell—’Tonker began.

‘—heck,’ Polly corrected her, ‘and you’re talking to Betty, remember.’

‘What the _heck_ are you talking about, Betty?’ said Tonker, rolling her
eyes.

‘Well, the song, of course. And you don’t have to lie down to tie a
garter in any case. It’d be more difficult,’ said Shufti. ‘It’s all a
bit silly.’

No one said anything for a while. It was, perhaps, easy to see why
Shufti was on her quest.

‘You’re right,’ said Polly eventually. ‘It’s a silly song.’

‘A very silly song,’ Tonker agreed.

They all agreed. It was a silly song.

They stepped out on to the river path. Ahead of them a small group of
women were hurrying round the bend in the track. Automatically, the
squad looked up. The keep grew out of the sheer cliff; it was hard to
see where the unhewn rock ended and the ancient masonry began. They
could see no windows. From here, it was just a wall extending to the
sky. No way in, it said. No way out. In this wall are few doors, and
they close with finality.

This close to the deep, slow river, the air was bone-chillingly cold,
and grew colder the higher they looked. Around the curve they could see
the little rock shelf where the back door was, and the women ahead of
them talking to a guard.

‘This is not going to work,’ said Shufti under her breath. ‘They’re
showing him some papers. Anyone brought theirs? No?’

The soldier had looked up and was watching the girls, with that blank
official expression of someone who was not looking for excitement or
adventure in his life.

‘Keep moving,’ murmured Polly. ‘If it all gets really bad, burst into
tears.’

‘That’s disgusting,’ said Tonker.

Their treacherous feet were taking them closer all the time. Polly kept
her eyes downwards, as was proper in an unmarried woman. There would be
others watching, she knew it. They’d probably be bored, they might not
be expecting any trouble, but up on those walls there were eyes fixed on
her.

They reached the guard. Just inside the narrow stone doorway there was
another one, lounging in the shadow.

‘Papers,’ said the guard.

‘Oh, sir, I have none,’ said Polly. She’d been working out the speech on
the way down through the wood. War, fears of invasion, people fleeing,
no food . . . you didn’t have to make things up, you just had to
reassemble reality. ‘I had to leave—’

‘Oh, _right_,’ the guard interrupted. ‘No papers? No problem! If you’d
just step in and see my colleague? Nice of you to join us!’ He stood
aside and waved a hand towards the dark entrance.

Mystified, Polly stepped inside, with the others following. Behind them,
the door swung shut. Inside, she saw that they were in a long passage
with many slits in the walls to rooms on either side. Lamplight shone
from the slits. She could see shadows beyond them. Bowmen concealed
there could turn anyone trapped in here into mince.

At the end of the corridor another door swung open. It led into a small
room in which there sat, at a desk, a young man in a uniform Polly
didn’t recognize, although it had a captain’s insignia. Standing to one
side was a much, much larger man in the same uniform, or possibly two
uniforms stitched together. He had a sword. There was that about him:
when this man held a sword, it was clearly being held, and held by him.
The eye was drawn to it. Even Jade would have been impressed.

‘Good morning, ladies,’ said the captain. ‘No papers, eh? Take off your
scarves, please.’

And that’s it, thought Polly, as the bottom of her stomach dropped away.
And we thought we were being clever. There was nothing for it but to
obey.

‘Ah. You’ll tell me your hair was shaved off as a punishment for
fraternizing with the enemy, eh?’ said the man, barely looking up.
‘Except for you,’ he added to Igorina. ‘Didn’t feel like fraternizing
with any enemies? Something wrong with decent Zlobenian boys?’

‘Er . . . no,’ said Igorina.

Now the captain gave them a bright little smile. ‘Gentlemen, let’s not
mess about, shall we? You walk wrong. We do _watch_, you know. You walk
wrong and you stand wrong. You,’ he pointed to Tonker, ‘have got a bit
of shaving soap under one ear. And you, sir, are either deformed or
you’ve tried the old trick of sticking a pair of socks down your vest.’

Crimson with embarrassment and humiliation, Polly hung her head.

‘Getting in or out disguised as washerwomen,’ said the captain, shaking
his head. ‘Everyone outside this stupid country knows that one, lads,
but most of them make more effort than you boys. Well, for you the war
is over. This place has got big, big dungeons and I don’t mind telling
you you’re probably going to be better off in here than outside— Yeah,
what do _you_ want?’

Shufti had raised a hand. ‘Can I show you something?’ she said. Polly
didn’t turn, but watched the captain’s face as, beside Polly, cloth
rustled. She couldn’t believe it. Shufti was raising her skirt . . .

‘Oh,’ said the captain, sitting back in his chair. His face went red.

There was an explosion from Tonker, but it was an explosion of tears.
They came out accompanied by a long, mournful wail, as she threw herself
on to the floor.

‘We walked so-oo far! We lay in ditches to hide from soldiers! There’s
no food! We want to work! You called us boys! Why are you so-oo
_cruel_?’

Polly knelt down and half picked her up, patting her on the back as
Tonker’s shoulders heaved with the force of her sobs.

‘It’s been very hard for all of us,’ she said to the red-faced captain.

‘_If you can take him down I can garrotte the other one with my apron
string_,’ whispered Tonker in her ear, between howls.

‘Have you seen everything you wish to see?’ said Polly to the blushing
captain, every syllable tinkling with ice.

‘Yes! No! Yes! Please!’ said the captain, giving the guard the agonized
glance of a man who knows that he’s going to be the laughing stock of
the whole fort inside the hour. ‘Once was quite— I mean, I’ve seen . . .
look, I’m completely satisfied. Private, go and fetch one of the women
from the laundry. I am so sorry, ladies, I . . . I have a job to do
. . .’

‘Do you enjoy it?’ said Polly, still freezing.

‘Yes!’ said the captain hurriedly. ‘I mean, no! No, yes! We have to be
careful . . . ah . . .’

The big soldier had returned, trailing a woman. Polly stared.

‘Some, er, new volunteers,’ said the captain, waving vaguely towards the
squad. ‘I’m sure Mrs Enid will have some use for them . . . er . . .’

‘Certainly, captain,’ said the woman, curtsying demurely. Polly still
stared.

‘Off you go . . . ladies,’ said the captain. ‘And if you’re hard workers
Mrs Enid will I am sure give you a pass so’s we don’t have this trouble
again . . . er . . .’

Shufti put both hands on his desk, leaned towards him and said ‘Boo’.
His chair hit the wall.

‘I may not be clever,’ she said to Polly. ‘But I’m not _stupid_.’

But Polly was still staring at Lieutenant Blouse. He’d curtsied
surprisingly well.

The soldier escorted them along a tunnel which opened on to a ledge
overlooking what was either a cave or a room; it was at that level in
the keep where there was not much difference. This wasn’t a laundry, but
clearly some hot, damp afterlife for those who required punishment with
extra scrubbing. Steam rolled across the ceiling, condensed, and dripped
on to a floor that was already running with water. And it went on for
ever, washtub after washtub. Women moved like ghosts through the
drifting, tumbling clouds of fog.

‘There you go, ladies,’ he said, and slapped Blouse on the rump. ‘See
you tonight, then, Daphne?’

‘Oh, yes!’ trilled Blouse.

‘Five o’clock, then,’ said the soldier, and ambled off down the
corridor.

‘Daphne?’ said Polly, when the man had gone.

‘My “nom de guerre”,’ said Blouse. ‘I still haven’t found a way out of
the lower areas but the guards all have keys and I shall have his key in
my hand by half past five. Pardon?’

‘I think Tonker – sorry, _Magda_ – just bit her tongue,’ said Polly.

‘Her? Oh, yes. Well done for staying in character, er . . .’

‘Polly,’ said Polly.

‘Good choice of name,’ said Blouse, leading the way down some steps.
‘It’s a good common, maidservanty sort of name.’

‘Yes, that’s what I thought,’ said Polly gravely.

‘Er . . . Sergeant Jackrum not with you, then?’ said the lieutenant,
with a trace of nervousness.

‘No, sir. He said he was going to lead a charge on the main gates, sir,
if we sent him a signal. I hope he doesn’t try without one.’

‘Good heavens, the man’s mad,’ said Blouse. ‘Splendid effort from the
lads, though. Well done. You’d definitely pass for women to the casual
observer.’

‘Coming from you, Daphne, that is a big compliment,’ said Polly,
thinking: gosh, I’m really good at keeping a straight face.

‘But you didn’t need to come after me,’ said Blouse. ‘I’m sorry I
couldn’t get a signal to you, but Mrs Enid allowed me to stay overnight,
you see. The guards don’t do so many checks at night so I made use of my
time to look for ways into the upper keep. All gated or really heavily
guarded, I’m afraid. However, Private Hauptfidel has taken rather a
shine to me . . .’

‘Well done, sir!’ said Polly.

‘Sorry, I want to be clear, sir,’ said Tonker. ‘_You have a date with a
guard_?’

‘Yes, and I’ll suggest we go somewhere dark and then when I’ve got what
I want I shall break his neck,’ said Blouse.

‘Isn’t that going a bit far on a first date?’ said Tonker.

‘Sir, did you have any trouble getting in?’ said Polly. This had been
nagging at her. It seemed so unfair.

‘No, not at all. I just smiled and wiggled my hips and they waved me
through. What about you?’

‘Oh, we had a little bit,’ said Polly. ‘It was a bit hair— it was a bit
awkward for a moment or two.’

‘What did I tell you?’ said Blouse triumphantly. ‘It’s all down to
thespian ability! But you were plucky lads to try it. Come and meet Mrs
Enid. A very loyal lady. The brave womenfolk of Borogravia are on our
side!’

And, indeed, there was a picture of the Duchess in the alcove that
served the laundry mistress for an office. Mrs Enid wasn’t a
particularly large woman but she had forearms like Jade, a soaking wet
apron, and the most mobile mouth Polly had ever seen. Her lips and
tongue drew out every word like a big shape in the air; the laundresses,
in a cavern full of hissing steam, echoes, falling water and the thud of
wet clothes on stone, watched lips when ears were overwhelmed. When she
was listening her mouth moved all the time, too, like someone trying to
dislodge a piece of nut from a tooth. She wore her sleeves rolled up
above her elbows.

She listened impassively as Blouse introduced the squad. ‘I see,’ she
said. ‘Right. You leave your lads here with me, sir. You ought to get
back to the pressing room.’

When Blouse had bounced and wobbled back through the steam, Mrs Enid
looked them all up and down, and then straight through.

‘Lads,’ she grunted. ‘Hah! That’s all he knows, eh? For a woman to wear
the clothes of a man is an Abomination in the Eyes of Nuggan!’

‘But we’re dressed as _women_, Mrs Enid,’ said Polly meekly.

Mrs Enid’s mouth moved ferociously. Then she folded her arms. It was
like a barricade going up against all that was ungodly.

‘It’s not right,’ she said. ‘I’ve got a son and a husband prisoner in
this place and I’m working meself to the bone for the enemy just so’s I
can keep an eye on ’em. They’re gonna invade, y’know. It’s amazing what
we hear down here. So what good’s rescuing your men going to do ’em when
we’re all under the heel of the Zlobenian hand-painted clog, eh?’

‘Zlobenia will not invade,’ said Wazzer confidently. ‘The Duchess will
see to it. Be not afraid.’

Wazzer got given the sort of look she always got when someone heard her
for the first time.

‘Been praying, ’ave yer?’ said Mrs Enid kindly.

‘No, just listening,’ said Wazzer.

‘Nuggan talks to you, does he?’

‘No. Nuggan is dead, Mrs Enid,’ said Wazzer.

Polly took Wazzer’s matchstick-thin arm and said: ‘Excuse us a moment,
Mrs Enid.’ She hustled the girl behind a huge, water-driven clothes
mangle. It heaved and clanked as a background to their conversation.

‘Wazzer, this is getting . . .’ Polly’s native tongue had no word for
‘freaky’, but if she had known about the word she would have welcomed
its inclusion ‘. . . strange. You’re worrying people. You can’t just go
around saying that a god is dead.’

‘Gone, then. Dwindled . . . I think,’ said Wazzer, her brow furrowing.
‘No longer with us . . .’

‘We still get the Abominations.’

Wazzer tried to concentrate. ‘No, they’re not real. They’re like . . .
echoes. Dead voices in an ancient cave, bouncing back and forth, the
words changing, making nonsense . . . like flags that were used for
signals but now just flap in the wind . . .’ Wazzer’s eyes went
unfocused and her voice altered, became more adult, more certain ‘. . .
and they come from no god. There is no god here now.’

‘So where _do_ they come from?’

‘From your fear . . . They come from the part that hates the Other, that
will not change. They come from the sum of all your pettiness and
stupidity and dullness. You fear tomorrow, and you’ve made your fear
your god. The Duchess knows this.’

The water-mangle creaked onwards. Around Polly the boilers hissed, water
gushed in the runnels. The air was loaded with the smells of soap and
damp cloth.

‘I don’t believe in the Duchess, either,’ said Polly. ‘That was just
trickery in the woods. Anyone’d look round. It doesn’t mean I believe in
her.’

‘That doesn’t matter, Polly. She believes in you.’

‘Really?’ Polly glanced around the steaming, dripping cave. ‘Is she
here, then? Has she graced us with her presence?’

Wazzer had no concept of sarcasm. She nodded. ‘Yes.’

YES.

Polly looked behind her.

‘Did you just say yes?’ she demanded.

‘Yes,’ said Wazzer.

YES.

Polly relaxed. ‘Oh, it’s an _echo_. This is a cave, after all. Uh . . .’

. . . which doesn’t explain why _my_ voice doesn’t come bouncing back
. . .

‘Wazz . . . I mean, Alice?’ she said thoughtfully.

‘Yes, Polly?’ said Wazzer.

‘I think it would be a really good idea if you don’t talk too much about
this to the others,’ she said. ‘People don’t mind believing in, you
know, gods and so on, but they get very nervous if you tell them they’re
showing up. Er . . . she’s not _going_ to show up, is she?’

‘The person you don’t believe in?’ said Wazzer, showing a flash of
spirit.

‘I’m . . . not saying she doesn’t exist,’ said Polly weakly. ‘I just
don’t believe in her, that’s all.’

‘She’s very weak,’ said Wazzer. ‘I hear her crying in the night.’

Polly sought for further information in the pinched-up face, hoping that
in some way Wazzer was making fun of her. But nothing but puzzled
innocence looked back.

‘Why does she cry?’ she said.

‘The prayers. They hurt her.’

Polly spun round when something touched her shoulder. It was Tonker.

‘Mrs Enid says we’re to get to work,’ she said. ‘She says the guards
come round and check . . .’

It was women’s work, and therefore monotonous, backbreaking and social.
It had been a long time since Polly had got her hands in a washtub, and
the ones here were long wooden troughs, where twenty women could work at
once. Arms on either side of her squeezed and pummelled, wrung out
garments and slapped them into the rinsing trough behind them. Polly
joined in, and listened to the buzz of conversation around her.

It was gossip, but bits of information floated in it like bubbles in the
washtub. A couple of guards had ‘taken liberties’ – that is, more than
had already been taken – and had apparently been flogged for it. This
caused much comment along the tub. Apparently some big milord from
Ankh-Morpork was in charge of things and had ordered it. He was some
kind of wizard, said the woman opposite. They said he could see things
happening everywhere, and lived on raw meat. They said he had secret
eyes. Of course, everyone knew that that city was the home of
Abominations. Polly, industriously rubbing a shirt on a washboard,
thought about this. And thought about a lowland buzzard in this upland
country, and some creature so fast and stealthy that it was only a
suggestion of shadow . . .

She took a spell on the copper boilers, ramming the stewing garments
under the bubbling surface, and noted that in this place without weapons
of any sort she was using a heavy stick about three feet long.

She enjoyed the work, in a dumb kind of way. Her muscles did all the
necessary thinking, leaving her brain free. No one knew for sure that
the Duchess was dead. It more or less didn’t matter. But Polly was sure
of one thing. The Duchess had been a woman. Just a woman, not a goddess.
Oh, people prayed to her in the hope that their pleas would be
gift-wrapped and sent on to Nuggan, but that gave her no right to mess
with the heads of people like Wazzer, who had enough trouble as it was.
Gods could do miracles, Duchesses posed for pictures.

Out of the corner of her eye Polly saw a line of women taking large
baskets from a platform at the end of the room and stepping out through
another doorway. She dragged Igorina away from the wash trough and told
her to join them. ‘And notice everything!’ she added.

‘Yes, corp,’ said Igorina.

‘Because I know one thing,’ said Polly, waving at the piles of damp
linen, ‘and it’s that this lot will need the breeze . . .’

She went back to work, occasionally joining in the chatter for the look
of the thing. It wasn’t hard. The washerwomen kept away from some
subjects, particularly ones like ‘husbands’ and ‘sons’. But Polly picked
up clues here and there. Some were in the keep. Some were probably dead.
Some were out there, somewhere. Some of the older women wore the
Motherhood Medal, awarded to women whose sons had died for Borogravia.
The bastard metal was corroding in the damp atmosphere, and Polly
wondered if the medals had arrived in a letter from the Duchess, with
her signature printed on the bottom and the son’s name squeezed up tight
to fit the space:

We honour and congratulate you, _Mrs L. Lapchic_ of _Well Lane, Munz_,
on the death of your son _Otto PiotrHanLapchic_ on _June 25_ at

The place was always censored in case it brought aid and comfort to the
enemy. It astonished Polly to find that the cheap medals and thoughtless
words did, in a way, bring aid and comfort to the mothers. Those in Munz
who had received them wore them with a sort of fierce, indignant pride.

She wasn’t sure she trusted Mrs Enid very much. She had a son and a
husband up in the cells, and she’d had a chance to weigh up Blouse.
She’d be asking herself: what’s more likely, that he gets them all out
and keeps them safe, or that there’s going to be an almighty mess which
might well harm us all? And Polly couldn’t blame her if she went with
the evidence . . .

She was aware of someone talking to her. ‘Hmm?’ she said.

‘Look at this, will you?’ said Shufti, waving a sodden pair of men’s
long pants at her. ‘They keep putting the colours in with the whites!’

‘Well? So what? These are _enemy_ longjohns,’ said Polly.

‘Yes, but there’s such a thing as doing it properly! Look, they put in
this red pair and all the others are going pink!’

‘And? I used to love pink when I was about seven.’⁹

‘But pale pink? On a man?’

Polly looked at the next tub for a moment, and patted Shufti on the
shoulder. ‘Yes. It is _very_ pale, isn’t it? You’d better find a couple
more red items,’ she said.

‘But that’d make it even worse—’ Shufti began.

‘That was an _order_, soldier,’ Polly whispered in her ear. ‘And add
some starch.’

‘How much?’

‘All you can find.’

Igorina returned. Igorina had good eyes. Polly wondered if they’d ever
belonged to someone else. She gave Polly a wink and held up a thumb. It
was, to Polly’s relief, one of her own.

In the huge ironing room, only one person was working at the long boards
when Polly, taking advantage of the temporary absence of Mrs Enid,
hurried in. It was ‘Daphne’. All the rest of the women were gathered
round, as if they were watching a demonstration. And they were.

‘—the collar, d’you see,’ said Lieutenant Blouse, flourishing the big,
steaming, charcoal-filled iron. ‘_Then_ the sleeve cuffs and finally the
sleeves. Do one front half at a time. You should hang them immediately
but, and here’s a useful tip, don’t iron them completely dry. It’s
really a matter of practice, but—’

Polly stared in fascinated wonder. She’d _hated_ ironing. ‘Daphne, could
I have a word?’ she said, during a pause.

Blouse looked up. ‘Oh, P . . . Polly,’ he said. ‘Um, yes, of course.’

‘It’s amazing what Daphne knows about pleat lines,’ said a girl, in awe.
‘_And_ press cloths!’

‘I _am_ amazed,’ said Polly.

Blouse handed the iron to the girl. ‘There you are, Dympha,’ he said
generously. ‘Remember: always iron the wrong side first, and only ever
do the wrong side on dark linens. Common mistake. Coming, Polly.’

Polly kicked her heels for a while outside, and one of the girls came up
with a big pile of fresh-smelling ironing. She saw Polly, and leaned
close as she went past. ‘We all _know_ he’s a man,’ she said. ‘But he’s
having such fun and he irons like a demon!’

‘Sir, how do you _know_ about ironing?’ said Polly, when they were back
in the washing room.

‘Had to do my own laundry back at HQ,’ said Blouse. ‘Couldn’t afford a
gel and the batman was a strict Nugganite and said it was girls’ work.
So I thought, well, it can’t be hard, otherwise we wouldn’t leave it to
women. They really aren’t very good here. You know they put the colours
and the whites together?’

‘Sir, you know you said you were going to steal a gate key off a guard
and break his neck?’ said Polly.

‘Indeed.’

‘Do you know _how_ to break a man’s neck, sir?’

‘I read a book on martial arts, Perks,’ said Blouse, a little severely.

‘But you haven’t actually _done_ it, sir?’

‘Well, no! I was at HQ, and you are not allowed to practise on real
people, Perks.’

‘You see, the person whose neck you want to break will have a weapon at
that moment and you, sir, won’t,’ said Polly.

‘I have tried out the basic principle on a rolled-up blanket,’ said
Blouse reproachfully. ‘It seemed to work very well.’

‘Was the blanket struggling and making loud gurgling noises and kicking
you in the socks, sir?’

‘The socks?’ said Blouse, puzzled.

‘In fact I think your other idea would be better, sir,’ said Polly
hurriedly.

‘Yes . . . my, er . . . other idea . . . which one was that, exactly?’

‘The one where we escape from the washhouse via the clothes-drying area,
sir, after silently disabling three guards, sir. There’s a kind of
moving room down the corridor over there, sir, which gets winched all
the way to the roof. Two guards go up there with the women, sir, and
there’s another guard up on the roof. Acting together, we’d take out
each unsuspecting guard, which would be more certain than you against an
armed man, with all due respect, sir, and that would leave us very well
positioned to go anywhere in the keep via the rooftops, sir. Well done,
sir!’

There was a pause. ‘Did I, er, go into all that detail?’ said Blouse.

‘Oh, no, sir. You shouldn’t have to, sir. Sergeants and corporals deal
with the fine detail. Officers are there to see the big picture.’

‘Oh, absolutely. And, er . . . how big was this particular picture?’
said Blouse, blinking.

‘Oh, very big, sir. A very big picture indeed, sir.’

‘Ah,’ said Blouse, and straightened up and assumed what he considered to
be the expression of one with panoramic vision.

‘Some of the ladies here used to work in the upper keep, sir, when it
was ours,’ Polly went on quickly. ‘Anticipating your order, sir, I had
the squad engage them in light conversation about the layout of the
place, sir. Being aware of the general thrust of your strategy, sir, I
think I have found a route to the dungeons.’

She paused. It had been good flannelling, she knew. It was almost worthy
of Jackrum. She’d larded it with as many ‘sirs’ as she dared. And she
was very proud of ‘anticipating your order’. She hadn’t heard Jackrum
use it, but with a certain amount of care it was an excuse to do almost
_anything_. ‘General thrust’ was pretty good, too.

‘Dungeons,’ said Blouse thoughtfully, momentarily losing sight of the
big picture. ‘In fact I thought I said—’

‘Yessir. _Because_, sir, if we can get a lot of the lads out of the
dungeons, sir, you’ll be in command _inside_ the enemy’s citadel, sir!’

Blouse grew another inch, and then sagged again. ‘Of course, there are
some very senior officers here. All of them senior to me—’

‘Yessir!’ said Polly, well on the way to graduating from the Sergeant
Jackrum School of Outright Rupert Management. ‘Perhaps we’d better try
to let the enlisted men out first, sir? We don’t want to expose the
officers to enemy fire.’

It was shameless and stupid, but now the light of battle was in Blouse’s
eyes. Polly decided to fan it, just in case. ‘Your leadership has really
been a great example to us, sir,’ she said.

‘Has it?’

‘Oh, yes, sir.’

‘No officer could have led a finer bunch of men, Perks,’ said Blouse.

‘Probably they have, sir,’ said Polly.

‘And what man could dare hope for such an opportunity, eh?’ said Blouse.
‘Our names will go down in the history books! Well, mine will,
obviously, and I shall jolly well see to it that you chaps get a mention
too. And who knows? Perhaps I may win the highest accolade that a
gallant officer may obtain!’

‘What’s that, sir?’ said Polly dutifully.

‘Having either a foodstuff or an item of clothing named after one,’ said
Blouse, his face radiant. ‘General Froc got both, of course. The frock
coat and Beef Froc. Of course, I could never aspire _that_ high.’ He
looked down bashfully. ‘But I have to say, Perks, that I have devised
several recipes, just in case!’

‘So we’ll be eating a Blouse one day, sir?’ said Polly. She was watching
the baskets being stacked.

‘Possibly, possibly, if I may dare hope,’ said Blouse. ‘Er . . . my
favourite is a sort of pastry ring, d’you see, filled with cream and
soaked in rum—’

‘That’s a Rum Baba, sir,’ said Polly absently. Tonker and the others
were watching the stacked baskets, too.

‘It’s been done?’

‘’fraid so, sir.’

‘How about . . . er . . . a dish of liver and onions?’

‘It’s called liver-and-onions, sir. Sorry,’ said Polly, trying not to
lose concentration.

‘Er, er, well, it has struck me that some dishes are named after people
when really they just made a little change to a basic recipe—’

‘We must go now, sir! Now or never, sir!’

‘What? Oh. Right. Yes. We must go!’

It was a military manoeuvre hitherto unrecorded. The squad, coming from
different directions on Polly’s signal, arrived at the baskets just
ahead of the women who’d proposed to take them up, grabbed the handles
and advanced. Only then did she realize that probably _no one_ else
wanted the job, and the women were only too happy to let idiot newcomers
take the strain. The baskets were big and the wet washing was heavy.
Wazzer and Igorina could barely lift one basket between them.

A couple of soldiers were waiting by the door. They looked bored, and
paid little attention. It was a long walk to the ‘elevator’.

Polly hadn’t been able to picture it when it had been described. You had
to see it. It really was just a big open box of heavy timbers, attached
to a thick rope, which ran up and down in a sort of chimney in the rock.
When they were aboard, one of the soldiers hauled on a much thinner rope
that disappeared up into the darkness. The other one lit a couple of
candles, whose only apparent role was to make the darkness more gloomy.

‘No fainting now, girls!’ he said. His mate chuckled.

Two of them and seven of us, Polly thought. The copper stick banged
against her leg as she moved, and she knew for a fact that Tonker was
limping because _she_ had strapped a washing dolly under her dress. That
was for _serious_ washerwomen; it was a long stick with what looked like
a three-legged milking stool on the end of it, the better for agitating
clothes in a big cauldron of boiling water. You could probably smash a
skull with it.

The stone walls dropped past as the platform rose.

‘How thrilling!’ trilled ‘Daphne’. ‘And this goes all the way up through
your big castle, does it?’

‘Oh, no, miss. Gotta go up through the rock first, miss. Lots of old
workings and everything before we get that high.’

‘Oh, I thought we were in the castle already.’ Blouse gave Polly a
worried look.

‘No, miss. There’s just the washhouse down there, ’cos of the water.
Hah, it’s a climb and a half even to the lower cellars. Lucky for you
there’s this elevator, eh?’

‘Wonderful, sergeant,’ said Blouse, and allowed Daphne back. ‘How does
it work?’

‘It’s corporal, miss,’ said the string-puller, touching his forelock.
‘It’s pulled up and down by pris’ners in a treadmill, miss.’

‘Oh, how horrid!’

‘Oh no, miss, it’s quite humane. Er . . . if you’re free after work, er,
I could take you up and show you the mechanism . . .’

‘That would be lovely, sergeant!’

Polly put her hand over her eyes. Daphne was a disgrace to womanhood.

The elevator rumbled upwards, quite slowly. Mostly they passed raw rock
but sometimes there were ancient gratings or areas of masonry,
suggestive of tunnels long ago blocked—

There was a jerk, and the platform stopped moving. One of the soldiers
swore under his breath, but the corporal said, ‘Don’t be afraid, ladies.
This often happens.’

‘Why should we be afraid?’ said Polly.

‘Well, because we’re hanging by a rope a hundred feet up the shaft and
the lifting machinery’s thrown a cog.’

‘Again,’ said the other soldier. ‘Nothing works properly here.’

‘Sounds like a good reason to me,’ said Igorina.

‘How long will it take to repair?’ said Tonker.

‘Hah! Last time it happened we were stuck for an hour!’

Too long, Polly thought. Too many things could happen. She looked up
through the beams in the roof. The square of daylight was a long way up.

‘We can’t wait,’ she said.

‘Oh dear, who will save us?’ Daphne quavered.

‘We’ll have to find a way to pass the time, eh?’ said one of the guards.
Polly sighed. That was one of those phrases, like ‘Well, lookee what we
have here’, that meant things were only going to get a lot worse.

‘We know how it is, ladies,’ the guard went on. ‘Your menfolk away, and
all. It’s as bad for us, too. I can’t remember when I last kissed my
wife.’

‘And I can’t remember when I last kissed his wife, either,’ said the
corporal.

Tonker jumped up, caught a beam, and chinned herself to the top of the
box. The elevator shook and, somewhere, a piece of rock dislodged and
crashed down the shaft.

‘Hey, you can’t do that!’ said the corporal.

‘Where does it say?’ said Tonker. ‘Polly, there’s one of those filled-in
tunnels here, only most of the stones have been knocked out. We could
get in easily.’

‘You can’t get out! We’ll get into trouble!’ said the corporal.

Polly pulled his sword out of his scabbard. The space was too crowded to
do much with it except threaten, but _she_ had it, not him. It made a
huge difference.

‘You’re already in trouble,’ she said. ‘Please don’t force me to make it
worse. Let’s get out of here. Is that okay, Daphne?’

‘Um . . . yes, of course,’ said Blouse.

The other guard laid a hand on his own sword. ‘Okay, girls, this has
gone—’ he began, and then slumped. Shufti lowered her copper stick.

‘I hope I didn’t hit him too hard,’ she said.

‘Who cares? Come on, I can give you all a hand up,’ said Tonker.

‘Igorina, could you have a look at him, and—’ Shufti began nervously.

‘He’s a man, and he’s groaning,’ said Tonker from above. ‘That’s good
enough for me. Come _on_.’

The lone guard watched as the others were womanhandled on to the beams.

‘Er, excuse me,’ he said to Polly, as she helped Blouse up.

‘Yes? What?’

‘Would you mind giving _me_ a wallop on the back of the head?’ he said,
looking wretched. ‘Only it looks like I didn’t put up a fight against a
bunch of women.’

‘Why _don’t_ you put up a fight?’ said Polly, narrowing her eyes. ‘We’re
only a bunch of women.’

‘I’m not crazy!’ said the guard.

‘Here, let me,’ said Igorina, producing her stick. ‘Blows to the head
are potentially harmful and should not be undertaken lightly. Turn
round, sir. Remove your helmet, please. Would twenty minutes’
unconsciousness be okay?’

‘Yes, thanks very mu—’

The guard folded up.

‘I really hope I didn’t hurt the other one,’ moaned Shufti, from above.

‘He’s swearing,’ said Polly, removing his sword. ‘That sounds like he’s
okay.’

She handed up the candles, and then was hauled on to the trembling roof
of the elevator. When she had a firm footing in the mouth of the tunnel
she found a sliver of stone and stamped it hard into the space between
the shaft wall and the wooden frame, which shook. It wasn’t going
anywhere for a while.

Tonker and Lofty were already investigating the tunnel. By candlelight,
it looked like good masonry beyond the clumsy attempt at walling it up.

‘It must be cellars,’ said Tonker. ‘I reckon they must’ve made the shaft
not long ago and just walled up where it cut through. Could have done a
better job, too.’

‘Cellars are close to dungeons,’ said Polly. ‘Now, pinch out one candle,
because that way we’ll have light for twice as long, and then—’

‘Perks, a word please?’ said Blouse. ‘Over here?’

‘Yessir.’

When they were standing a little apart from the rest of the squad,
Blouse lowered his voice and said: ‘I don’t wish to discourage
initiative, Perks, but what are you doing?’

‘Er . . . anticipating your orders, sir.’

‘Anticipating them?’

‘Yessir.’

‘Ah. Right. This is still small-picture stuff, is it?’

‘Exactly, sir.’

‘Then my orders, Perks, are to proceed with speed and caution to release
the prisoners.’

‘Well done, sir. We’ll go through this . . . this—’

‘Crypt,’ said Igorina, looking round.

The candle blew out. Somewhere ahead of them, in darkness absolute and
velvet thick, stone moved on stone.

‘I wonder _why_ this passage was sealed up?’ said the voice of Blouse.

‘I think I’ve stopped wondering why it was sealed up in such a hurry,’
said Tonker.

‘I wonder who tried to open it?’ said Polly.

There was a crash of, as it might be, a heavy slab falling off an ornate
tomb. It could have been half a dozen other things but, somehow, that
was the image that sprang to mind. The dead air moved a little.

‘I don’t want to worry anyone,’ said Shufti, ‘but I can hear the sound
of sort of feet, sort of dragging.’

Polly remembered the man lighting the candles. He’d dropped the bundle
of matches into the brass saucer of the candlestick, hadn’t he? Moving
her hand slowly, she groped for them.

‘If you didn’t want to worry anyone,’ came the voice of Tonker from the
dry, thick darkness, ‘why the hell did you just tell us that?’

Polly’s fingers found a sliver of wood. She raised it to her nose, and
sniffed the sulphurous smell.

‘I’ve got one match,’ she said. ‘I’m going to try to light the candle
again. Everyone look for a way out. Ready?’

She sidled to the invisible wall. Then she scratched the match down the
stone, and yellow light filled the crypt.

Someone whimpered. Polly stared, candle forgotten. The match went out.

‘O-kay,’ said the subdued voice of Tonker. ‘Walking dead people. So?’

‘The one near the archway was the late General Puhloaver!’ said Blouse.
‘I have his book on _The Art of Defence_!’

‘Best not to ask him to autograph it, sir,’ said Polly, as the squad
bunched together.

There was the whimpering again. It seemed to come from where Polly
remembered Wazzer standing. She heard her praying. There were no words
that she could make out, just a fierce and urgent whispering.

‘Maybe these washing sticks can slow them down a bit?’ Shufti quavered.

‘More than being dead already?’ said Igorina.

_No_, a voice whispered, and light filled the crypt.

It was barely brighter than a glow-worm, but a single photon can do a
lot of work in chthonic darkness. It rose above the kneeling Wazzer
until it was woman height, because it was a woman. Or, at least, it was
the shadow of a woman. No, Polly saw, it was the _light_ of a woman, a
moving web of lines and highlights in which there came and went, like
pictures in a fire, a female shape.

‘Soldiers of Borogravia . . . attention!’ said Wazzer. And underneath
her reedy little tone was a shadow voice, a whisper that filled and
refilled the long room.

SOLDIERS OF BOROGRAVIA . . . ATTENTION!

 _Soldiers_ . . .

     _Soldiers, attention!_

         _Soldiers of Borogravia_ . . .

The lurching figures stopped. They hesitated. They shuffled backwards.
With a certain amount of clattering and tongueless bickering, they
formed two lines. Wazzer stood up.

‘Follow me,’ she said.

_Follow me_ . . .

     . . . _me_ . . .

‘Sir?’ said Polly to Blouse.

‘I think we go, don’t you?’ said the lieutenant, who seemed oblivious of
Wazzer’s activities now he was in the presence of the military might of
the centuries. ‘Oh, god . . . there’s Brigadier Galosh! And
Major-general the Lord Kanapay! General Annorac! I’ve read everything he
wrote! I never thought I’d see him in the flesh!’

‘_Partly_ flesh, sir,’ said Polly, dragging him forward.

‘Every great commander of the last five hundred years was buried here,
Perks!’

‘I’m very pleased for you, sir. If we could just move a little faster
. . .’

‘It is my fondest hope that I’ll spend the rest of eternity here, you
know.’

‘Wonderful, sir, but not starting today. Can we catch up with the rest
of them, sir?’

As they passed, hand after ragged hand was raised in jerky salute.
Staring eyes gleamed in hollow faces. The strange light glistened on
dusty braid and stained, faded cloth. And there was a noise, harsher
than the whispering, deep and guttural. It sounded like the creaking of
distant doors, but individual voices rose and fell as the squad passed
the dead figures . . .

_Death to Zlobenia . . . get them . . . remember . . . give them hell
. . . vengeance . . . remember . . . they’re not human . . . avenge us
. . . revenge_ . . .

Up ahead, Wazzer had reached some high wooden doors. They swung open at
her touch. The light travelled with her, and the squad were on her
heels. To be too far behind was to be in the dark.

‘Couldn’t I just ask Major-general—’ Blouse began, dragging on Polly’s
hand.

‘No! You can’t! Don’t dawdle! Come on!’ Polly commanded.

They reached the doors, which Tonker and Igorina slammed behind them.
Polly leaned against the wall.

‘I think that was the most . . . most amazing moment of my life,’ said
Blouse, as the boom died away.

‘I think this is mine,’ said Polly, fighting for breath.

Light still glowed around Wazzer, who turned to face the squad with an
expression of beatific pleasure. ‘You must speak to the High Command,’
she said.

_You must speak to the High Command_, whispered the walls.

‘Be kind to this child.’

_Be kind to this child_ . . .

     . . . _this child_ . . .

Polly caught Wazzer before she hit the ground.

‘What is happening with her?’ said Tonker.

‘I think the Duchess really is speaking through her,’ said Polly. Wazzer
was unconscious, only the whites of her eyes showing. Polly laid her
down gently.

‘Oh, come on! The Duchess is just a painting! She’s dead!’

Sometimes you give in. For Polly, that time had been the length of time
it took to walk through the crypt. If you don’t believe, or don’t want
to believe, or if you don’t simply hope that there’s something worth
believing in, why turn round? And if you don’t believe, who are you
trusting to lead you out of the grip of dead men?

‘Dead?’ she said. ‘So what? What about the old soldiers back there, who
haven’t faded away? What about the light? And you heard how Wazzer’s
voice sounded.’

‘Yeah, but . . . well, that sort of thing doesn’t happen to people you
_know_,’ said Tonker. ‘It happens to . . . well, strange religious
people. I mean, a few days ago she was learning how to fart loudly!’

‘She?’ whispered Blouse to Polly. ‘She? Why is—’

Once again a part of Polly’s mind overtook the sudden panic. ‘Sorry,
_Daphne_?’ she said.

‘Oh . . . yes . . . of course . . . can’t be too . . . yes . . .’ the
lieutenant murmured.

Igorina knelt down by the girl and put a hand on her forehead. ‘She’s on
fire,’ she said.

‘She used to pray all the time back at the Grey House,’ said Lofty,
kneeling down.

‘Yeah, well, there was a lot to pray about, if you weren’t strong,’
growled Tonker. ‘And every bloody day we had to pray to the Duchess to
thank Nuggan for slops you wouldn’t give to a pig! And that damn picture
everywhere, that fishy stare . . . I hate it! It could drive you mad.
That’s what happened to Wazz, right? And now you want me to believe the
fat old biddy is alive and treating our friend there like some . . .
puppet or something? I don’t believe that. And if it’s true, it
shouldn’t be!’

‘She’s burning up, Magda,’ said Lofty quietly.

‘D’you know why we joined up?’ said Tonker, red in the face. ‘To get
away! Anything was better than what we had! I’ve got Lofty and Lofty’s
got me, and we’re sticking with you because there’s nothing else for us.
Everyone says the Zlobenians are terrible, right? But they’ve never done
anything to _us_, they’ve never hurt _us_. If they want to come over
here and hang a few bastards, I could give ’em a list! Everywhere
there’s something bad happening, everywhere the small-minded bullies are
inventing new cruelties, new ways of keeping us down, that bloody face
is watching! And you say it’s _here_?’

‘_We’re_ here,’ said Polly. ‘And you are here. And we’re going to do
what we came to do and get out, understand? You kissed the picture, you
took the shilling!’

‘I damn well didn’t kiss her face! And a shilling’s the least they owe
me!’

‘Then go!’ shouted Polly. ‘Desert! We won’t stop you, because I’m sick
of your . . . your bullshit! But you make up your mind right now, _right
now_, understand? Because when we meet the enemy I don’t want to think
you’re there to stab me in the back!’

The words flew out before she could stop them, and there was no power in
the world that could snatch them back.

Tonker went pale, and a certain life drained out of her face like water
from a funnel. ‘_What was that you said?_’

The words ‘You heard me!’ lined up to spring from Polly’s tongue, but
she hesitated. She told herself: it doesn’t have to go this way. You
don’t have to let a pair of socks do the talking.

‘Words that were stupid,’ she said. ‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.’

Tonker settled slightly. ‘Well . . . all right, then,’ she said
grudgingly. ‘Just so long as you know we’re in this for the squad, okay?
Not for the army and not for the bloody Duchess.’

‘That was a treasonable speech, Private Halter!’ said Lieutenant Blouse.

Everyone but Polly had forgotten about him, and he stood there like an
easy man to forget.

‘However,’ he went on, ‘I realize we’re all what . . .’ he looked down
at his dress ‘. . . _confused_ and, er, bewildered by the pace of events
. . .’

Tonker tried to avoid Polly’s eye. ‘Sorry, sir,’ she muttered,
glowering.

‘I must make it clear that I will not stand to hear such things
repeated,’ said Blouse.

‘No, sir.’

‘Good,’ said Polly quickly. ‘So let’ s—’

‘But I will overlook it this time,’ Blouse went on.

Polly could _see_ Tonker snap. The head was raised slowly. ‘You’ll
overlook it?’ said Tonker. ‘_You_ will overlook it?’

‘_Careful_,’ said Polly, just loud enough for Tonker to hear.

‘Let me tell you something about us, lieutenant,’ said Tonker, grinning
horribly.

‘We are here, private, _whoever_ we are,’ snapped Polly. ‘Now let’s find
the cells!’

‘Um . . .’ said Igorina, ‘we’re quite close, I think. I can see a sign.
Um. It’s at the end of this passage. Um . . . just behind those three
rather puzzled armed men with the, um . . . _efficient_-looking
crossbows. Um. I think what you’ve just been saying was important and
needed to be said. Only, um . . . not just now, perhaps? And not so
loudly?’

Only two guards were watching them now, raising their bows cautiously.
The other was running away down the passage, shouting.

The squad, as one man, or woman, shared the thoughts. They’ve got bows.
We haven’t. They’ve got forcements behind them. We haven’t. All we’ve
got is a darkness full of the restless dead. We haven’t even got a
prayer any more.

Blouse made an effort, nevertheless. In the tones of Daphne he shrilled:
‘Oh, officers . . . we seem to have got lost on the way to the ladies’
room . . .’

They were not put into a dungeon, although they were marched past
plenty. There were lots of bleak stone corridors, lots of heavy doors
with bars and lots and lots of bolts, and lots of armed men whose job,
presumably, only became interesting if all the bolts disappeared. They
were put into a kitchen. It was huge, and clearly not the kind of place
where people chopped herbs and stuffed mushrooms. In a gloomy, grimy,
soot-encrusted hall like this, cooks had probably catered for hundreds
of hungry men. Occasionally the door was opened and shadowy figures
stared in at them. No one had said anything, at any time.

‘They were expecting us,’ muttered Shufti. The squad were sitting on the
floor with their backs to a huge, ancient chopping block, except for
Igorina, who was tending to the still-unconscious Wazzer.

‘They couldn’t have got that elevator up by now,’ said Polly. ‘I wedged
that stone in good and hard.’

‘Then maybe the washerwomen gave us away,’ said Tonker. ‘I didn’t like
the look of Mrs Enid.’

‘It doesn’t matter now, does it?’ said Polly. ‘Is that the only door?’

‘There’s a storeroom at the other end,’ said Tonker. ‘No exit, except a
grille in the floor.’

‘Could we get out that way?’

‘Only diced.’

They stared glumly at the distant door. It had opened again, and there
was some muffled conversation amongst the silhouettes beyond. Tonker had
tried advancing on the open doorway, and found men with swords suddenly
occupying it. Polly turned to look at Blouse, who was slumped against
the wall, staring blankly upwards.

‘I’d better go and tell him,’ she said. Tonker shrugged.

Blouse opened his eyes and smiled wanly when Polly approached. ‘Ah,
Perks,’ he said. ‘We almost made it, eh?’

‘Sorry we let you down, sir,’ said Polly. ‘Permission to sit, sir?’

‘Treat the rather chilly flagstones as if they were your own,’ said
Blouse. ‘And it was I that let you down, I’m afraid.’

‘Oh, no, sir—’ Polly protested.

‘You were my first command,’ said Blouse. ‘Well, apart from Corporal
Drebb and he was seventy and only had one arm, poor chap.’ He pinched
the bridge of his nose. ‘All I had to do was get you to the valley. That
was all. But, no, I foolishly dreamed of a world where everyone would
one day wear a Blouse. Or eat one, possibly. I should have listened to
Sergeant Jackrum! Oh, will I ever look my dear Emmeline in the face
again?’

‘I don’t know, sir,’ said Polly.

‘That was meant to be more of a rhetorical cry of despair than an actual
question, Perks,’ said Blouse.

‘Sorry, sir,’ said Polly. She took a deep breath, ready for the plunge
into the icy depths of the truth. ‘Sir, you ought to know that—’

‘And I’m afraid once they realize we aren’t women we’ll be put in the
big dungeons,’ the lieutenant went on. ‘Very big, and very dirty, I’m
told. And very crowded.’

‘Sir, we _are_ women, sir,’ said Polly.

‘Yes, well done, Perks, but we don’t have to pretend any more.’

‘You don’t understand, sir. We really _are_ women. All of us.’

Blouse grinned nervously. ‘I think you’ve got a little . . . confused,
Perks. I seem to recall that the same thing happened to Wrigglesworth—’

‘Sir—’

‘—although I have to say he was very good at choosing curtains—’

‘_No_, sir. I was a— I _am_ a girl, and I cut my hair and pretended I
was a boy and took the Duchess’s shilling, sir. Take my word for it,
sir, because I really don’t want to have to draw you a picture. We
played a trick on you, sir. Well, not a trick, really, but we, all of
us, had reasons for being somewhere else, sir, or at least not being
where we were. We lied.’

Blouse stared at her. ‘You’re sure?’

‘Yes, sir. I am of the female persuasion. I check every day, sir.’

‘And Private Halter?’

‘Yes, sir.’

‘_And_ Lofty?’

‘Oh, yes, sir. Both of them, sir. Don’t go there, sir.’

‘What about Shufti?’

‘Expecting a baby, sir.’

Suddenly, Blouse looked terrified. ‘Oh, _no_. _Here?_’

‘Not for several months, sir, I believe.’

‘And poor little Private Goom?’

‘A girl, sir. And Igor is really an Igorina. And wherever she is,
Carborundum is really Jade. We’re not sure about Corporal Maladict. But
the rest of us definitely have pink blankets, sir.’

‘But you didn’t _act_ like women!’

‘No, sir. We acted like men, sir. Sorry, sir. We just wanted to find our
men or get away or prove a point or something. Sorry it had to happen to
you, sir.’

‘You’re _sure_ about all this, are you?’

What are you expecting me to say? Polly thought. ‘Whoops, now I come to
think about it, yes, we’re really men after all’? She settled for
saying: ‘Yes, sir.’

‘So . . . you’re not called Oliver, then?’ It seemed to Polly that the
lieutenant was having a lot of difficulty with all this; he kept asking
the same basic question in different ways, in the hope of getting
something other than the answer he didn’t want to hear.

‘No, sir. I’m Polly, sir—’

‘Oh? Do you know there is a song about—’

‘_Yes_, sir,’ said Polly firmly. ‘Believe me, I’d rather you didn’t even
hum it.’

Blouse stared at the far wall, eyes slightly unfocused. Oh dear, Polly
thought. ‘You took a terrible risk,’ he said distantly. ‘A battlefield
is no place for women.’

‘This war isn’t staying on battlefields. At a time like this, a pair of
trousers is a girl’s best friend, sir.’

Blouse fell silent again. Suddenly, Polly felt very sorry for him. He
was a bit of a fool, in that special way very clever people have of
being foolish, but he wasn’t a bad man. He’d been decent to the squad
and he’d cared about them. He didn’t deserve this.

‘Sorry you had to be involved, sir,’ she said.

Blouse looked up. ‘Sorry?’ he said, and to her amazement he was looking
more cheerful than he had all day. ‘Good heavens, you don’t have to be
_sorry_. Do you know anything about history, Polly?’

‘Can we stick with Perks, sir? I’m still a soldier. No, I don’t know
much history, sir. At least, much that I trust.’

‘Then you’ve never heard of the Amazon warriors of Samothrip? The most
fearsome fighting force for hundreds of years. All women! Absolutely
merciless in battle! They were deadly with the longbow, although in
order to get maximum draw they had to cut off one of their, um . . . er
. . . I say, you ladies haven’t been cutting off your, um, er . . .’

‘No, we haven’t cut off any um ers, sir. Only hair.’

Blouse looked incredibly relieved. ‘Well, and then there’s the female
bodyguards of King Samuel in Howandaland. All seven feet tall, I
understand, and deadly with the spear. Throughout Klatch, of course,
there are many stories of female warriors, often fighting alongside
their men. Fearsome and fearless, I believe. Men would desert rather
than face females, Perks. Couldn’t deal with ’em.’

Once again, Polly felt the slightly unbalanced feeling of having tried
to jump a hurdle that turned out not to be there. She took refuge in:
‘What do you think’s going to happen now, sir?’

‘I haven’t a clue, Perks. Um . . . what’s wrong with young Goom? Some
kind of religious mania?’

‘Could be, sir,’ said Polly guardedly. ‘The Duchess talks to her.’

‘Oh dear,’ said Blouse. ‘She—’

The door opened. A dozen soldiers filed in and spread out on either
side. They had a variety of uniforms – mostly Zlobenian, but several
Polly recognized now as Ankh-Morporkic or whatever they called it. They
were all armed, and held their weapons like men who expected to use
them.

When they had lined up and were glaring at the squad, a smaller group of
men stepped in. Again, there was a variety of uniforms, but they were a
lot more expensive. These were worn by officers – high-ranking ones, to
judge by the expressions of disdain. The tallest of them, made taller by
his high, plumed cavalry helmet, stared along his nose at the women. He
had pale blue eyes, and his face suggested that he did not really want
to see anything at all in this room unless it had been thoroughly
cleaned first.

‘Who is the officer here?’ he said. He sounded like a lawyer.

Blouse stood up and saluted. ‘Lieutenant Blouse, sir, Tenth Infantry.’

‘I see.’ The man looked at his fellow officers. ‘I believe we can
dispense with the guard now, don’t you? This matter should be handled
quietly. And for heaven’s sake can’t we find this man a pair of
trousers?’

There were a few murmurs. The man nodded to the sergeant of the guard.
The armed men filed out, and the door shut behind them.

‘My name is Lord Rust,’ said the man. ‘I head the Ankh-Morpork
detachment here. At least,’ and he sniffed, ‘the military detachment.
You have been treated well? You have not been manhandled? I see there is
a . . . young lady on the floor.’

‘She’s in a swoon, sir,’ said Polly. The blue eyes lighted upon her.

‘You would be—?’ he said.

‘Corporal Perks, sir,’ said Polly. There were some barely suppressed
smiles from the officers.

‘Ah. I believe you are the one seeking her brother?’ said Lord Rust.

‘How do you know my name?’ said Polly.

‘We are an, mm, efficient army,’ said Rust, and treated himself to a
little smile of his own. ‘Your brother’s name is Paul?’

‘Yes!’

‘We shall locate him, eventually. And I understand another lady was
seeking her young man?’

Shufti curtsied nervously. ‘Me, sir.’

‘Again, we shall locate him, if you give us his name. Now, please listen
to me carefully. You, Miss Perks, and the rest of you, will be taken
from here, tonight, entirely unharmed, and escorted back into your
country as far as our patrols can take you, which, I suspect, will be
quite a long way. Is that understood? You will have what you came for.
Won’t that be nice? And you will not return here. The troll and the
vampire have been captured. The same offer applies to them.’

Polly was watching the officers. They looked nervous . . .

. . . except for one at the back. She’d thought all the guards had gone
and, while this man was dressed like a guard – dressed, that is, like a
badly dressed guard – he wasn’t acting like one. He was leaning against
the wall by the door, smoking half a cigar, and grinning. He looked like
a man enjoying a show.

‘Very generously,’ Rust went on, ‘this offer applies to you too,
Lieutenant . . . Blouse, wasn’t it? But in your case you would be on
parole in a house in Zlobenia, very pleasant I understand, healthy walks
in the countryside and all that sort of thing. This offer has not been
extended to your superior officers here, I may add.’

So why make it to us? Polly thought. Are you frightened? Of a bunch of
_girls_? That makes no sense . . .

Behind the officers, the man with the cigar winked at Polly. His uniform
was very old-fashioned – an ancient helmet, a breastplate, some slightly
rusted chain mail, and big boots. He wore it like a workman wears his
overalls. Unlike the braid and brilliance in front of her, the only
statement his clothes made was that he didn’t intend to get hurt. They
had no insignia that Polly could see, apart from a small shield hooked
on to the breastplate.

‘If you will excuse me a moment,’ said Blouse, ‘I will consult with my
men.’

‘Men?’ said Rust. ‘They’re a bunch of women, man!’

‘But at this moment, sir,’ said Blouse coolly, ‘I would not exchange
them for any six men you offered me. If you gentlemen would care to wait
outside?’

Behind the group, the badly dressed man burst into silent laughter. His
sense of humour was not shared by the rest of the group, however.

‘You cannot possibly consider refusing this offer!’ said Lord Rust.

‘Nevertheless, sir,’ said Blouse. ‘We will take a few minutes. I think
the ladies would prefer some privacy. One of them is expecting a child.’

‘What, _here_?’ As one man, the group drew back.

‘Not yet, I believe. But if you would just step outside—’

When the officers had retreated to the masculine safety of the corridor
the lieutenant turned to his squad. ‘Well, men? For you, it is a very
attractive offer, I have to say.’

‘Not for us,’ said Tonker. Lofty nodded.

‘Nor me,’ said Shufti.

‘Why not?’ said Blouse. ‘You would get your husband.’

‘That might be a bit difficult,’ mumbled Shufti. ‘Anyway, what about the
invasion?’

‘I’m not going to be sent home like a package,’ said Igorina. ‘Anyway,
that man has an objectionable bone structure.’

‘Well, Private Goom can’t join us right now,’ sighed Blouse. ‘So that
leaves you, Polly.’

‘Why are they doing this?’ said Polly. ‘Why do they want us out of the
way? Why aren’t they just leaving us locked up? This place must be full
of cells.’

‘Ah, perhaps they are sensible of the frailties of your sex,’ said
Blouse, and then fried in their stares. ‘I didn’t say _I_ was,’ he added
quickly.

‘They could just kill us,’ said Tonker. ‘Well, they could,’ she added.
‘Why not? Who’d care? I don’t think we count as prisoners of war.’

‘But they haven’t,’ said Polly. ‘And they’re not even threatening us.
They’re being very _careful_. I think they’re frightened of us.’

‘Oh, yeah, right,’ said Tonker. ‘Maybe they think we’re going to chase
them and give them a big wet sloppy kiss?’

‘Good, then we’re agreed that we’re not going to accept,’ said Blouse.
‘Damn right . . . oh, I do apologize . . .’

‘We all know the words, sir,’ said Polly. ‘I suggest we see how _much_
we frighten them, sir.’

The officers were waiting with unconcealed impatience, but Rust managed
a brief smile when he stepped back into the kitchen. ‘Well, lieutenant?’
he said.

‘We have given your offer due consideration, sir,’ said Blouse, ‘and our
reply is: stick it up your . . .’ He leaned down to Polly, who whispered
urgently. ‘Who? Oh, yes, right. Your jumper, sir. Stick it, in fact, up
your jumper. Named after Colonel Henri Jumper, I believe. A useful
woollen garment akin to a lightweight sweater, sir, which if I recall
correctly was named after Regimental Sergeant-Major Sweat. That, sir, is
where you may stick it.’

Rust received this calmly, and Polly wondered whether it was because he
hadn’t understood it. The scruffy man once more leaning against the wall
had understood it, though, since he was grinning.

‘I see,’ said Rust. ‘And that is the answer from all of you? Then you
leave us no choice. Good evening to you.’

His attempt to stride out was hindered by the other officers, who had
less sense of the dramatic moment. The door slammed behind them, but not
before the last man out turned very briefly and made a hand gesture. You
would have missed it if you weren’t watching him – but Polly _was_
watching.

‘That seemed to go well,’ said Blouse, turning away.

‘I hope we’re not going to get into trouble for that,’ said Shufti.

‘Compared to what?’ said Tonker.

‘The last man out stuck his thumb up and winked,’ said Polly. ‘Did you
notice him? He wasn’t even wearing an officer’s uniform.’

‘Probably wanted a date,’ said Tonker.

‘In Ankh-Morpork that means “jolly good”,’ said Blouse. ‘In Klatch, I
think, it means “I hope your donkey explodes”. I spotted the man. Looked
like a guard sergeant to me.’

‘Didn’t have stripes,’ said Polly. ‘Why’d he want to say jolly good to
us?’

‘Or hate our donkey so much?’ said Shufti. ‘How’s Wazzer?’

‘Sleeping,’ said Igorina. ‘I think.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘Well, I don’t think she’s dead.’

‘You don’t _think_ she is?’ said Polly.

‘Yes,’ said Igorina. ‘It’s like that. I wish I could keep her warmer.’

‘I thought you said she was burning up?’

‘She was. Now she’s freezing cold.’

Lieutenant Blouse strode over to the door, grabbed its handle and, to
the surprise of all, pulled it open. Four swords were levelled at him.

‘We have a sick man here!’ he snapped to the astonished guards. ‘We need
blankets and firewood! Get them now!’ He slammed the door. ‘It might
work,’ he said.

‘That door doesn’t have a lock,’ said Tonker. ‘Useful fact, Polly.’

Polly sighed. ‘Right now, I just want something to eat. This is a
kitchen, after all. There could be food here.’

‘This _is_ a kitchen,’ said Tonker. ‘There could be cleavers!’

But it is always upsetting to find that the enemy is as bright as you.
There was a well, but a web of bars across the top allowed for the
passage of nothing bigger than a bucket. And someone with no sense of
the narrative of adventure had removed from the room anything with an
edge and, for some reason, anything that could be eaten.

‘Unless we want to dine on candles,’ said Shufti, pulling a bundle of
them out of a creaking cupboard. ‘’s tallow, after all. I bet old
Scallot’d make candle scubbo.’

Polly checked the chimney, which smelled as though there had not been a
fire in it for a long time. It was big and wide, but six feet up a heavy
grille was hung with sooty cobwebs. It looked rusted and ancient, and
could probably be shifted by twenty minutes’ work with a crowbar, but
there’s never a crowbar when you want one.

There were some couple of sacks of ancient, dry and dusty flour in the
storeroom. It smelled bad. There was a thing with a funnel and a handle
and some mysterious screws.¹⁰ There were a couple of rolling pins, a
lettuce strainer, some ladles . . . and there were forks. Lots of
toasting forks. Polly felt let down. It was ridiculous to expect that
someone imprisoning people in some ad hoc cell would leave in all the
ingredients to effect an escape but, nevertheless, she felt that some
universal rule had been broken. They had nothing better than a club,
really. The toasting forks might prick, the lettuce strainer might pack
a punch, and the rolling pins were at least a traditional female weapon,
but all you could do with the thing with a funnel and a handle and
mysterious screws was baffle people.

The door opened. Armed men came in to act as protection for a couple of
women, carrying blankets and firewood. They scurried in with their eyes
cast down, deposited their burdens, and almost ran out. Polly strode
over to the guard who seemed to be in charge, and he backed away. A huge
key ring jingled on his belt.

‘You _knock_ next time, all right?’ she said.

He grinned nervously. ‘Yeah, right,’ he said. ‘They said we weren’t to
talk to you . . .’

‘Really?’

The jailer glanced around. ‘But we reckon you’re doing bloody well, for
girls,’ he said conspiratorially.

‘So that means you won’t shoot at us when we break out?’ said Polly
sweetly.

The grin faded. ‘Don’t try it,’ said the jailer.

‘What a big bunch of keys you have there, sir,’ said Tonker, and the
man’s hand flew to his belt.

‘You just stay in here,’ he said. ‘Things are bad enough already. You
stay here!’

He slammed the door. A moment later they heard something heavy being
pushed up against it.

‘Well, now we have a fire, at least,’ said Blouse.

‘Er . . .’ This was from Lofty. She volunteered a word so seldom that
the rest turned to look at her, and she stopped in embarrassment.

‘Yes, Lofty?’ said Polly.

‘Er . . . I know how to get the door open,’ muttered Lofty. ‘So it stays
open, I mean.’

Had it been anyone else, someone would have laughed. But words from
Lofty had obviously been turned over for some time before utterance.

‘Er . . . good,’ said Blouse. ‘Well done.’

‘I’ve been thinking about it,’ said Lofty.

‘Good.’

‘It will work.’

‘Just what we need, then!’ said Blouse, like a man trying against all
the odds to keep cheerful.

Lofty looked up at the big sooty beams that ran across the room. ‘Yes,’
she said.

‘But there’ll still be guards outside,’ said Polly.

‘No,’ said Lofty. ‘There won’t.’

‘There won’t?’

‘They’ll have gone away.’ Lofty stopped, with the air of one who’d said
everything that needed to be said.

Tonker walked over and took her arm. ‘We’ll just have a little chat,
shall we?’ she said, and led the girl to the other side of the room.
There was some whispered conversation. Lofty spent most of it staring at
the floor, and then Tonker came back.

‘We will need the bags of flour from the storeroom, and the rope from
the well,’ she said. ‘And one of those . . . what are those big round
things that cover dishes? With a knob on?’

‘Dish covers?’ said Shufti.

‘And a candle,’ Tonker went on. ‘And a lot of barrels. And a lot of
water.’

‘And what will all this do?’ said Blouse.

‘Make a big bang,’ said Tonker. ‘Tilda knows a lot about fire, believe
me.’

‘When you say she knows a lot . . .’ Polly began uncertainly.

‘I mean every place she worked at burned down,’ said Tonker.

They rolled the empty barrels to the middle of the room and filled them
with water from the pump. Under Lofty’s monosyllabic direction and the
rope from the well, they hauled three leaking, dusty flour sacks up as
high as possible, so that they twisted gently over the space between the
barrels and the door.

‘Ah,’ said Polly, standing back. ‘I think I understand. A flour mill on
the other side of town blew up two years ago.’

‘Yes,’ said Tonker. ‘That was Tilda.’

‘What?’

‘They’d been beating her. And worse. And the thing about Tilda is, she
just watches and thinks and somewhere in there it all comes together.
Then it explodes.’

‘But two people died!’

‘The man and his wife. Yes. But I heard that other girls sent there
never came back at all. Shall I tell you that Tilda was pregnant when
they brought her back to the Grey House after the fire? She had it, and
they took it away, and we don’t know what happened to it. And then she
got beaten again because she was an Abomination unto Nuggan. Does that
make you feel better?’ said Tonker, tying the rope to a table leg.
‘There’s just us, Polly. Just her and me. No inheritance, no nice home
to go back to, no relatives that we know of. The Grey House breaks us
all, somehow. Wazzer talks to the Duchess, I don’t have . . . middle
gears, and Tilda frightens me when she gets her hands on a box of
matches. You should see her face then, though. It lights up. Of course,’
Tonker smiled in her dangerous way, ‘so do other things. Better get
everyone into the storeroom while we light the candle.’

‘Shouldn’t Tilda do that?’

‘She will. But we’ll have to drag her away, otherwise she’ll stay and
watch.’

This had started like a game. She hadn’t _thought_ of it like a game,
but it was a game called Let Polly keep The Duchess. And now . . . it
didn’t matter. She’d made all kinds of plans, but she was beyond plans
now. They’d done bloody well, for girls . . .

A final barrel of water had been placed, after some discussion, in front
of the storeroom’s door. Polly looked over the top of it at Blouse and
the rest of the squad.

‘Okay, everybody, we’re . . . er . . . about to do it,’ she said. ‘Are
we _sure_ about this, Tonker?’

‘Yep.’

‘And _we_ won’t get hurt?’

Tonker sighed. ‘The dusty flour will explode. That’s simple. The blast
coming this way will hit the barrels full of water which’ll probably
last just long enough to see it rebound. The worst that should happen to
us is that we get wet. That’s what Tilda thinks. Would you argue? And in
the other direction, there’s only the door.’

‘How does she work this out?’

‘She doesn’t. She just sees how it should go.’ Tonker handed Polly the
end of a rope. ‘This goes over the beam and down to the dish lid. Can
you hold it, lieutenant? But don’t pull it until we say. I really mean
that. C’mon, Polly.’

In the space between the barrels and the door, Lofty was lighting a
candle. She did it slowly, as if it was a sacrament or some ancient
ceremony every part of which held enormous and complex meaning. She lit
a match, and held it carefully until the flame caught. She waved it back
and forth on the base of the candle, which she thrust firmly on to the
flagstones so that the hot wax stuck it into position. Then she applied
the match to the candle wick and knelt there, watching the flame.

‘Okay,’ said Tonker. ‘I’m just going to pick her up, and you just
_carefully_ lower the lid over the candle, right? C’mon, Tilda.’

She raised the girl carefully to her feet, whispering to her all the
time, and then nodded to Polly, who lowered the lid with a carefulness
that amounted to reverence.

Lofty walked as though asleep. Tonker stopped by the leg of the heavy
kitchen table, to which she’d attached the other end of the rope holding
the flour bags.

‘Okay so far,’ she said. ‘Now, when I pull the knot we each grab an arm
and we run, Polly, understand? We _run_. Ready? Got her?’ She hauled on
the rope. ‘_Run!_’

The flour sacks dropped, streaming white dust as they fell, and exploded
in front of the door. Flour rose like a fog. They raced for the
storeroom and fell in a heap past the barrel as Tonker screamed, ‘Okay,
lieutenant!’ Blouse pulled the rope that raised the lid and let the
candle flame reach—

The word was not _whoomph_. The _experience_ was whoomph. It had a
quality that overwhelmed every sense. It shook the world like a sheet,
painted it white and then, surprisingly, filled it with the smell of
toast. And then it was over, in a second, leaving nothing but distant
screams and the rumble of collapsing masonry.

Polly uncurled, and looked up into Blouse’s face. ‘I think we grab
things and run now, sir,’ she said. ‘And screaming would help.’

‘I think I can manage the screaming,’ muttered Shufti. ‘This is _not_ a
very nurturing experience.’

Blouse gripped his ladle. ‘I hope this isn’t going to be our famous last
stand,’ he said.

‘In fact, sir,’ said Polly, ‘I think it’s going to be our first.
Permission to yell in a bloodcurdling way, sir?’

‘Permission granted, Perks!’

The floor was awash with water and bits – quite small bits – of barrel.
Half the chimney had collapsed into the fireplace and the soot was
blazing fiercely. Polly wondered if, down in the valley, it’d look like
a signal.

The door had gone. So had a lot of wall around it. Beyond—

Smoke and dust filled the air. In it, men lay groaning, or picked their
way aimlessly across the rubble. When the squad arrived they did not
simply fail to put up a fight, they failed to understand. Or hear. The
women lowered their weapons. Polly spotted the sergeant, who was sitting
and hitting the side of his head with the flat of his hand.

‘Give me the keys!’ she demanded.

He tried to focus. ‘What?’

‘The keys!’

‘I’ll have a brown one, please.’

‘Are you okay?’

‘What?’

Polly reached down and snatched the key ring from the unresisting man’s
belt, fighting down an instinct to apologize. She threw it to Blouse.
‘Will you do the honours, sir? I think we’ll be having a lot of visitors
really soon.’ She turned to the squad. ‘The rest of you, get their
weapons off them!’

‘Some of these men are badly hurt, Polly,’ said Igorina, kneeling down.
‘There’s one here with multiple.’

‘Multiple what?’ said Polly, watching the steps.

‘Just . . . multiple. Multiple everything. But I know I can save his
arm, because I’ve just found it over there. I think he must’ve been
holding his sword and—’

‘Just do what you can, okay?’ said Polly.

‘Hey, they’re _enemies_,’ said Tonker, picking up a sword.

‘Thith ith an Igor thing,’ said Igorina, taking off her pack. ‘I’m
thorry, you wouldn’t underthtand.’

‘I’m beginning not to.’ Tonker joined Polly in her watch on the stairs.
Around them, men groaned and stone creaked. ‘I wonder how much damage we
did? There’s a lot of dust up there . . .’

‘There’ll be a lot of people here soon,’ said Polly, more calmly than
she felt. Because this is going to be it, she thought. _This_ time
there’s going to be no turkey to save us. This is where I find out if
I’m the meat or the metal . . .

She could hear Blouse unlocking doors, and the shouts from those within.
‘Lieutenant Blouse, Tenth Infantry!’ he was saying. ‘This is a rescue,
broadly speaking. Sorry about the mess.’

Probably his inner Daphne had added that last bit, Polly thought. And
then the corridor was full of released men, and someone said, ‘What are
these women doing here! For god’s sake, give me that sword, girl!’

And, right now, she wasn’t inclined to argue.

Men take over. It is probably because of socks.

The squad retired to the kitchen, where Igorina was at work. She worked
fast, efficiently and, on the whole, with very little blood. Her large
pack was open beside her. The jars inside were blue, green and red; some
of them smoked when she opened them, or gave off strange lights. Her
fingers moved in a blur. It was fascinating to watch her working. At
least, it was if you hadn’t just eaten.

‘Squad, this is Major Erick von Moldvitz! He asked to meet you.’

They turned at the sound of Blouse’s voice. He’d brought a newcomer. The
major was young, but much more heavily built than the lieutenant. He had
a scar across his face.

‘Stand easy, lads,’ he said. ‘Blouse here has been telling me what
crackin’ work you’ve been doing. Well done! Dressin’ up as women, eh?
Lucky you weren’t found out!’

‘Yessir,’ said Polly. From outside, there came the sound of cries and
fighting.

‘Didn’t bring your uniforms with you?’ said the major.

‘Could’ve been tricky if they were found on us,’ said Polly, staring at
Blouse.

‘Could’ve been tricky anyway, eh, if you were searched?’ said the major,
winking.

‘Yessir,’ said Polly obediently. ‘Lieutenant Blouse told you _all_ about
us, did he, sir?’

Just behind the major, Blouse was making a universal gesture. It
consisted of both hands held palm up and outwards and waggled furiously
with all fingers extended.

‘Hah, yes. Stole some clothes from a knockin’ shop, eh? Young lads like
you shouldn’t have gone in a place like that, eh? Those places are an
Abomination, if they’re run right!’ said the major, wagging a finger
theatrically. ‘Anyway, we’re doing well. Hardly any guards this deep in
the keep, y’see. The whole place was built on the basis that the enemy
would be on the _outside_! I say, what’s that man doin’ to the man on
the slab?’

‘Patching him up, thur,’ said Igorina. ‘Thewing hith arm back on.’

‘He’s an enemy, ain’t he?’

‘Code of the Igorth, thur,’ said Igorina reproachfully. ‘A thpare hand
_where needed_, thur.’

The major sniffed. ‘Oh well, can’t argue with you fellows, eh? But when
you’ve finished, we’ve got plenty of chaps out there who could do with
your help.’

‘Thertainly, thur,’ said Igorina.

‘Any news of my brother, sir?’ said Polly. ‘Paul Perks?’

‘Yes, Blouse here mentioned him, Perks, but there’s men locked up
everywhere and it’s a little tricky right now, eh?’ said the major
brusquely. ‘As for the rest of you, we’ll get you into a pair of
trousers as soon as possible and you can join in the fun, eh?’

‘The fun,’ said Tonker, in a hollow voice.

‘The fun being . . . ?’ said Polly.

‘We’ve got as far as the fourth floor already,’ said von Moldvitz. ‘We
might not have the whole keep back, but we hold the outer courtyards and
some of the towers. By morning, we’ll control who comes in and goes out.
We’re back in the war! They won’t invade now. Most of their top brass
are in the inner keep.’

‘Back in the war,’ murmured Polly.

‘And we will win!’ said the major.

‘Oh, _sugar_,’ said Shufti.

Something was going to give, Polly knew. Tonker had that look she got
before she exploded, and even Shufti was fidgeting. It would only be a
matter of time before Lofty found her box of matches, which Polly had
hidden in a cupboard.

Igorina packed up her bag and smiled brightly at the major. ‘Ready to
go, thur,’ she said.

‘At least remove the wig, eh?’

‘It’th my own hair, thur,’ said Igorina.

‘Looks a bit . . . cissy, then,’ said the major. ‘It would be better
if—’

‘I am, in fact, female, sir,’ said Igorina, dropping most of the lisp.
‘Trust me, I’m an Igor. We know about this sort of thing. And my
needlework ith second to none.’

‘A _woman_?’ said the major.

Polly sighed. ‘We all are, sir. Really women. Not just dressed up as
women. And right now I don’t want to put any trousers on because then
I’d be a woman dressed up as a man dressed up as a woman dressed up as a
man, and then I’d be so confused I wouldn’t know how to swear. And I
want to swear right now, sir, very much.’

The major turned stiffly to Blouse. ‘Did you know about this,
lieutenant?’ he barked.

‘Well . . . yes, sir. Eventually. But even so, sir, I would—’

_This_ cell was an old guardroom. It was damp, and had two creaking
bunks.

‘On the whole,’ said Tonker, ‘I think it was better when we were locked
up by the enemy.’

‘There’s a grille in the ceiling,’ said Shufti.

‘Not big enough to climb through,’ said Polly.

‘No, but we can hang ourselves before they do it.’

‘I’m told it’s a very painful way to die,’ said Polly.

‘Who by?’ said Tonker.

Occasionally the sounds of battle filtered through the narrow window.
Mostly it was yells; often it was screams. Fun was being had.

Igorina sat staring at her hands. ‘What’s _wrong_ with these?’ she said.
‘Didn’t I do a good job on that arm? But _no_, they’re afraid I might
touch their privates.’

‘Perhaps you could have promised to operate only on officers,’ said
Tonker. No one laughed, and probably no one would have bothered to run
for it if the door had swung open. It was a proud and noble thing to
escape from the enemy, but if you were escaping from your own side,
where would you escape to?

On one of the bunks, Wazzer slept like a hibernating bear. You had to
watch her for some time to see her breathe.

‘What can they do to us?’ said Shufti nervously. ‘You know . . .
_really_ do to us?’

‘We were wearing men’s clothes,’ said Polly.

‘But that’s only a beating.’

‘Oh, they’ll find some other stuff, believe you me,’ said Tonker.
‘Besides, who knows we’re here?’

‘But we got them out of prison! Our side!’

Polly sighed. ‘That’s _why_, Shufti. _No one_ wants to know that a bunch
of girls dressed up as soldiers and broke into a big fort and let out
half an army. Everyone knows females can’t do that. Neither side wants
us here, understand?’

‘On a battlefield like this, who’ll worry about a few more bodies?’ said
Tonker.

‘Don’t say that! Lieutenant Blouse spoke up for us,’ said Shufti.

‘What, _Daphne_?’ said Tonker. ‘Hah! Just another body. They’ve probably
locked him up somewhere, just like us.’

There was a distant cheering, which went on for some time.

‘Sounds like they’ve got the building,’ said Polly.

‘Hooray for us,’ said Tonker, and spat.

After a while, a small hatch was opened in the door and a silent man
handed through a big can of scubbo and a tray of horse-bread. It wasn’t
bad scubbo or, at least, not bad scubbo by the standards of bad scubbo.
There was some discussion about whether being fed meant you weren’t
going to be executed, until someone pointed out the tradition of the
Last Hearty Meal. Igorina gave it as her cultural opinion that the stew
was not only hearty but lungy and livery too. But at least it was hot.

A couple of hours later a can of saloop was handed through, with some
mugs. This time, the guard winked.

An hour after that, the door was unlocked. A young man in a major’s
uniform stepped inside.

Oh well, let’s go on as we started, Polly thought. She leapt to her
feet. ‘Squaddd . . . tennn . . . _hut!_’

With reasonable speed, the squad at least managed to stand up straight
and in a line. The major acknowledged her by tapping the peak of his cap
with a stick. It was definitely thinner than an inch.

‘Stand easy . . . corporal, isn’t it?’ he said.

‘Yessir.’ That sounded promising.

‘I am Major Clogston, of the Provost’s office,’ said the major. ‘And I’d
like you to tell me all about it. About everything. I will make notes,
if you don’t mind.’

‘What’s this about?’ said Tonker.

‘Ah, you’d be . . . Private Halter,’ said Clogston. ‘I’ve already spoken
at length to Lieutenant Blouse.’ He turned, nodded at the guard hovering
in the doorway, and shut the door. He also closed the hatch.

‘You are going to be tried,’ he said, sitting down on the spare bunk.
‘The politicos want you to be tried by a full Nugganatic court, but that
would be tricky here, and no one wants this to go on for any longer than
it has to. Besides, there has been an . . . unusual event. Someone has
sent a communiqué to General Froc asking about you all by name. At
least,’ he added, ‘by your surnames.’

‘Was that Lord Rust, sir?’

‘No, it was someone called William de Worde. I don’t know if you’ve run
across his newspaper thing? We’re wondering how he knew you were
captured.’

‘Well, _we_ didn’t tell him!’ said Polly.

‘It makes things a little . . . tricky,’ said Clogston. ‘Although, from
your point of view, a lot more hopeful. There are those members of the
army who are, let us say, considering the future of Borogravia. That is,
they would like there to be one. My job is to present your case to the
tribunal.’

‘Is that a court martial?’ said Polly.

‘No, they’re not that stupid. Calling it a court martial would indicate
that they accept that you are soldiers.’

‘_You_ did,’ said Shufti.

‘_De facto_ is not _de jure_,’ said Clogston. ‘Now, as I said . . . tell
me your story, Miss Perks.’

‘That’s Corporal, thank you!’

‘I apologize for the lapse. Now . . . go on . . .’ Clogston opened his
bag and produced a pair of half-moon spectacles, which he put on, and
took out a pencil and something white and square. ‘Whenever you’re
ready?’ he added.

‘Sir, are you really going to write on a jam sandwich?’ said Polly.

‘What?’ The major looked down, and laughed. ‘Oh. No. Excuse me. I really
mustn’t miss meals. Blood sugar, you know . . .’

‘Only it’s oozing, sir. Don’t mind us. We’ve eaten.’

It took an hour, with many interruptions and corrections, and two more
sandwiches. The major used up quite a lot of notebook, and occasionally
had to stop and stare at the ceiling.

‘. . . and then we were thrown in here,’ said Polly, sitting back.

‘Pushed, really,’ said Igorina. ‘Nudged.’

‘Mmm,’ said Clogston. ‘You say Corporal Strappi, as you knew him, was
. . . suddenly very ill at the thought of going into battle?’

‘Yessir.’

‘And in the tavern in Plün you really kneed Prince Heinrich in the
fracas?’

‘In or about the fracas, sir. And I didn’t know it was him at the time,
sir.’

‘I see you haven’t mentioned the attack on the hilltop where, according
to Lieutenant Blouse, your prompt action got the enemy code book . . .’

‘Not really worth mentioning, sir. We didn’t do much with it.’

‘Oh, I don’t know. Because of you and that nice man from the newspaper
the alliance has had two regiments trotting around in the mountains
after some guerrilla leader called “Tiger”. Prince Heinrich insisted,
and is in fact in command. He is, you could say, a sore loser. Very
sore, according to rumour.’

‘The newspaper writer believed all that stuff ?’ said Polly, amazed.

‘I don’t know, but he certainly wrote it down. You say Lord Rust offered
to let you all go home quietly?’

‘Yessir.’

‘And the consensus was that he could . . .’

‘Stick it up his jumper, sir.’

‘Oh, yes. I couldn’t read my own writing. J . . . U . . . M . . .’
Clogston carefully wrote the word in capital letters, and then said: ‘I
am not saying this, I am not here, but some . . . senior . . . people on
our side are wondering if you _would_ just quietly go . . . ?’

The question hung in the air like a corpse from a beam.

‘I’ll put that down as “jumper” too, then, shall I?’ said Clogston.

‘Some of us have got nowhere to go _to_,’ said Tonker.

‘Or no one to go with,’ said Shufti.

‘We haven’t done anything wrong,’ said Polly.

‘Jumper it is, then,’ said the major. He folded up his little spectacles
and sighed. ‘They won’t even tell me what charges are going to be made.’

‘Being Bad Girls,’ said Tonker. ‘Who are we fooling, sir? The enemy
wanted just to be quietly rid of us, and the general wants the same
thing. That’s the trouble about the good guys and the bad guys. They’re
all guys!’

‘Would we have got a medal, sir, if we’d been men?’ Shufti demanded.

‘Yep. Certainly. And Blouse would have been promoted on the spot, I
imagine. But right now we’re at war, and this might not be the time—’

‘—to thank a bunch of Abominable women?’ Polly suggested.

Clogston smiled. ‘I was going to say “to lose concentration”. It’s the
political branch who are pushing for this, of course. They want to stop
word getting around. And high command want this over quickly for the
same reason.’

‘When is all this going to start?’ said Polly.

‘In about half an hour.’

‘This is stupid!’ said Tonker. ‘They’re in the middle of a war and
they’re going to take the time to hold a trial for a few women who
haven’t even done anything wrong?’

‘The general has insisted,’ said Clogston. ‘He wants this cleared out of
the way.’

‘And what authority has this tribunal got?’ said Polly coldly.

‘Thousands of men under arms,’ said Clogston. ‘Sorry. The trouble is,
when you say to a general “You and whose army?” he just has to point out
of the window. But I intend to prove that the meeting should be a court
martial. You all kissed the Duchess? You took the shilling? _I_ say that
makes it military business.’

‘And that’s good, is it?’

‘Well, it means there are procedures. The last Abomination from Nuggan
was against jigsaw puzzles. They break the world into pieces, he says.
That’s making people think, at last. The army may be crazy, but at least
it’s crazy by numbers. It’s _reliably_ insane. Er, your sleeping friend
. . . will you leave her here?’

‘No,’ said the squad, as one woman.

‘She needs my constant attention,’ said Igorina.

‘If we leave her she might have a sudden attack of vanishing without a
trace,’ said Tonker.

‘We stick together,’ said Polly. ‘We don’t leave a man behind.’

* * *

The room chosen for the tribunal was a ballroom. More than half the keep
had been taken back, Polly learned, but the distribution of ground was
erratic. The alliance still held the central buildings, and the armoury,
but were entirely surrounded by Borogravian forces. The current prize to
fight for was the main gate complex, which hadn’t been built to
withstand attack from inside. What was happening out there now was a
brawl, a midnight bar fight but on a huge scale. And, since there were
various war engines atop the towers now occupied by either side, the
keep was shooting at itself, in the finest traditions of the circular
firing squad.

The floor in here smelled of polish and chalk. Tables had been pushed
together to make a rough semicircle. There must have been more than
thirty officers, Polly thought. Then she saw the other tables behind the
semicircles, and the maps, and the people scurrying in and out, and
realized that this was not just about _them_. This was a war-room.

The squad were marched in, and stood at attention. Igorina had
browbeaten a couple of guards to carry Wazzer on a stretcher. That
circle of stitches under her eye was worth more than a colonel’s pips.
No soldier wanted to be on the wrong side of the Igors.

They waited. Occasionally an officer would glance at them, and go back
to looking at a map, or talking. Then Polly saw some whispering going
on, heads turned again, and there was a drift towards the semicircle of
seats. There was a definite sense that here was a tiresome chore that,
regrettably, had to be done.

General Froc did not look directly at the squad until he had taken his
seat in the centre of the group and adjusted his papers neatly. Even
then, his eye passed over them quickly, as if it was afraid to stop.
Polly had never seen him before. He was a handsome man, and still had a
fine head of white hair. A scar down one side of his face had just
missed an eye, and showed up against the wrinkles.

‘Things are moving well,’ he said, to the room at large. ‘We have just
heard that a flying column led by the remnant of the Tenth are closing
on the keep and attacking the main gates from outside. Someone must have
seen what is happening. The army is on the move!’

There was a certain amount of refined cheering at this, none of it from
the squad. The general glanced at them again.

‘Is this all of them, Clogston?’ he said.

The major, who at least had a small table to himself, stood up and
saluted. ‘No, sir,’ he said. ‘We are awaiting—’

The doors opened again. Jade was brought in, chained between two much
larger trolls. Maladict and Blouse trailed behind her. It seemed that in
all the rush and confusion no one had found any trousers for Blouse, and
Maladict looked slightly blurred. His chains jingled constantly.

‘I object to the chains, sir,’ said Clogston.

The general held a whispered consultation with a few of the other
officers. ‘Yes, we do not want undue formality,’ he said, nodding at the
guards. ‘Remove them. You trolls can go. I just want the guards to
remain on the door. Now, let us proceed. This really shouldn’t take too
long. Now then, you people,’ he settled himself in his chair, ‘this
really is very simple. With the exception of Lieutenant Blouse, you will
agree to be returned to your homes and placed in the charge of a
responsible male, understood? And no more will be said about this
matter. You have showed considerable spirit, there is no doubt about
that, but it was misplaced. We are not ungrateful, however. We
understand that none of you is married and so we will present you all
with suitable, indeed, with handsome dowries—’

Polly saluted. ‘Permission to speak, sir?’

Froc stared at her, and then looked pointedly at Clogston.

‘You’ll have a chance to speak later, corporal,’ said the major.

‘But what exactly have we done wrong, sir?’ said Polly. ‘They should
tell us.’

Froc looked at the far end of the row of chairs. ‘Captain?’ he said.

A short officer got to his feet. In Polly’s face, the tide of
recognition raced across the mudflats of hatred.

‘Captain Strappi, political division, sir—’ he began, and stopped at the
groan from the squad. When it had died away he cleared his throat, and
went on: ‘Twenty-seven Abominations have been committed under Nugganatic
law, sir. I suspect there have been many more. Under military law, sir,
we have the simple fact that they posed as men in order to join up. I
was there, sir, and saw it all.’

‘Captain Strappi, may I congratulate you on your rapid promotion?’ said
Lieutenant Blouse.

‘Yes, indeed, captain,’ said Clogston. ‘Apparently you were a humble
corporal only a few days ago?’

Plaster dust drifted down again as something heavy struck the wall
outside. Froc brushed it off his paperwork.

‘Not one of ours, I hope,’ he said, to a certain amount of laughter. ‘Do
go ahead, captain.’

Strappi turned to the general. ‘As you know, sir, it is occasionally
necessary for us in the political division to assume a lower rank in
order to gain intelligence. Covered under the Regulations, sir,’ he
added.

The look that General Froc gave him stirred a little teacup of hope in
Polly’s breast. No one could like something like Strappi, not even a
mother. Then the general turned back to Clogston.

‘Is this germane, major?’ he said testily. ‘We know they disguised
themselves as—’

‘—women, sir,’ said Clogston smoothly. ‘That’s all we know, sir. Apart
from Captain Strappi’s assertion, and I intend to suggest later that
this is tainted, I haven’t yet heard any evidence that they have dressed
in any other way.’

‘We have the evidence of our own eyes, man!’

‘Yes, sir. They’re wearing dresses, sir.’

‘And they’re practically bald!’

‘Yes, sir,’ said Clogston. He picked up a thick book, dripping with
bookmarks. ‘Book of Nuggan, sir: “It is a Beatitude unto Nuggan that An
Woman shall wear her hair short, that the amorous propensities of men be
not therefore inflamed.”’

‘I don’t see a lot of bald women around!’ snapped Froc.

‘Yes, sir. It is one of those utterances that people find somewhat
tricky, like the one about not sneezing. I should say at this point,
sir, that I intend to show that Abominations are routinely committed by
all of us. We have got into the habit of ignoring them, in fact, which
opens up an interesting debate. In any case, short hair is
Nugganatically correct. In short, sir, and in short hair, the ladies
appear to have been involved in nothing more than a little laundry, a
kitchen accident and the release of your good self from the cells.’

‘I saw them!’ snarled Strappi. ‘They looked like men and they acted like
men!’

‘Why were you in the recruiting party, captain?’ said Major Clogston. ‘I
would not have thought one of those would have been a hotbed of
seditious activity?’

‘Is that a relevant question, major?’ said the general.

‘I don’t know, sir,’ said Clogston. ‘That’s why I asked. I don’t think
we would wish it to be said that these ladies had not been given a fair
hearing?’

‘Said by whom?’ said Froc. ‘My officers can be relied upon to be
discreet.’

‘Said by the ladies themselves, sir?’

‘Then we must require that they do _not_ speak to anyone!’

‘Oh, I say!’ said Blouse.

‘And how will you enforce this, sir?’ said Clogston. ‘Against these
women who, we are agreed, stole you out of the jaws of the enemy?’

There was some muttering amongst the officers.

‘Major Clogston, did you have lunch?’ said the general.

‘No, sir.’

‘Colonel Vester said you become a little . . . erratic when you miss
meals . . .’

‘No, sir. I become tetchy, sir. But I think a little tetchiness is
called for right now. I put a question to Captain Strappi, sir.’

‘Very well, captain, perhaps you will tell us why you were with that
recruiting party?’ said the general wearily.

‘I was . . . investigating a soldier, sir. A noncommissioned officer.
Our attention had been drawn to irregularities in his files, sir, and
where there are irregularities we generally find sedition. I hesitate to
talk about this, sir, because this sergeant has been of some service to
yourself—’

‘Hrumph!’ said the general loudly. ‘This is not a matter for discussion
here, I think.’

‘It was just that according to the files, several officers had helped—’
Strappi went on.

‘Hrumph! Not matters for this court, captain! Are we agreed, gentlemen?’

‘Yes, sir, it was just that the major asked me and I—’ Strappi began,
bewildered.

‘Captain, I suggest you learn what a hrumph means!’ roared Froc.

‘So what were you looking for when you rummaged through our stuff ?’
said Polly, as Strappi shrank.

‘Mmmmmy cccccoffee!’ said Maladict. ‘Yyyyyou ssssstole mmmmmy
cccccoffee!’

‘And you ran away when you were told you were going into combat, you
little dog’s pizzle!’ said Tonker. ‘Polly said you pissed your drawers!’

General Froc slammed his fist on the table, but Polly noticed that one
or two officers were trying to conceal a smile. ‘These are not matters
for this inquiry!’ he said.

‘Although, sir, one or two of them seem to me to be subjects for
investigation later on,’ said a colonel, further along the table. ‘The
personal belongings of enlisted men may only be searched in their
presence, general. This may seem a trivial point, but men have mutinied
over it in the past. Did you, in fact, believe the . . . men to be women
when you did this, captain?’

_Oh, say yes, please say yes_, Polly thought, as Strappi hesitated.
_Because when we talk about how those cavalrymen found us so quickly,
it’ll mean you set them on a bunch of Borogravian girls. Let’s see how
that one plays in Plün! And if you didn’t know, then why were you
rummaging?_

Strappi preferred the rock to the hard place. Stone clattered down in
the courtyard outside, and he had to raise his voice to make himself
heard.

‘I was, er, generally suspicious of them, sir, because they were so
keen—’

‘Sir, I protest!’ said Clogston. ‘Keenness is not a military vice!’

‘In moderation, certainly,’ said Froc. ‘And you found evidence of some
sort, did you?’

‘I did find a petticoat, sir,’ said Strappi, feeling his way with care.

‘Then why didn’t you—’ Froc began, but Strappi interrupted.

‘I did serve for a while with Captain Wrigglesworth, sir,’ he said.

‘And?’ said Froc, but the officer on his left leaned over and whispered
something to him. ‘Oh, _Wrigglesworth_. Ha, yes,’ said Froc. ‘Of course.
Fine officer, Wrigglesworth. Keen on, er—’

‘Amateur dramatics,’ a colonel supplied, in a noncommittal voice.

‘Right! Right! Ver’ good for morale, that sort of thing. Hrumph.’

‘With respect, general, I think I can offer a way through?’ said another
man with a general’s rank.

‘Really, Bob?’ said Froc. ‘Oh, well . . . feel free. The record will
show that I am yielding the floor to General Kzupi.’

‘I’m sorry, sir, I thought these proceedings were not being recorded?’
said Clogston.

‘Yes, yes, of course, thank you _so_ much for jogging my memory,’ said
Froc. ‘However, if we _were_ to have a record, that is what it would
show. Bob?’

‘Ladies,’ said General Kzupi, flashing the squad a glossy smile. ‘And
you too, of course, Lieutenant Blouse, and you too, er . . .’ he looked
quizzically at Maladict, who stared straight back ‘. . . sir?’ General
Kzupi, though, was not to be derailed by an eyeballing vampire, even one
that couldn’t stand still. ‘Firstly, may I offer on behalf of all of us,
I think, our thanks for the incredible job you have done? A splendid
effort. But, sadly, the world we live in has certain . . . rules, you
understand? To be frank, the problem here is not that you are women. As
such, that is. But you persist in _maintaining_ that you are. You see?
We can’t have that.’

‘You mean if we put on uniforms again, and swaggered around belching and
saying “har har, fooled you all” that would be all right?’ said Polly.

‘Perhaps I could help?’ said yet another voice. Froc looked along the
table.

‘Ah, Brigadier Stoffer. Yes?’

‘This is all rather damn silly, general—’

‘Hrumph!’ said Froc.

‘What say?’ said Stoffer, looking puzzled.

‘There _are_ ladies present, brigadier. That is, ahah, the problem.’

‘Damn right!’ said Tonker.

‘Understood, general. But the party was led by a man, am I right?’

‘Lieutenant Blouse tells me he is a man, sir,’ said Clogston. ‘Since he
is an officer and a gentleman, I will take his word for it.’

‘Well, then, problem solved. These young ladies helped him. Smuggled him
in, and so forth. _Assisted_ him. Fine traditions of Borogravian
womanhood and all that. Not _soldiers_ at all. Give the man a big medal
and make him a captain, and all this’ll be forgotten.’

‘Excuse me one moment, general,’ said Clogston. ‘I will consult with
what we would call the accused if anyone would enlighten me as to the
precise nature of the charges.’

He walked over to the squad and lowered his voice. ‘I think this is the
best offer you’re going to get,’ he said. ‘I can probably get the money,
too. How about it?’

‘It’s completely ridiculous!’ said Blouse. ‘They showed tremendous
courage and determination. All this would not have been possible without
them.’

‘Yes, Blouse, and you would be allowed to say that,’ said Clogston.
‘Stoffer has come up with quite a clever idea. Everyone gets what they
want, but you just have to avoid any suggestion that you were in fact
acting as soldiers. Brave Borogravian women going to the aid of a
gallant hero, that _works_. You could take the view that these are
changing times, and you are helping them change faster. Well?’

The squad exchanged glances.

‘Er . . . I’d be happy about that,’ Shufti ventured. ‘If everyone else
is.’

‘So you’d have your baby without a husband?’ said Polly.

‘He’s probably dead anyway, whoever he was,’ sighed Shufti.

‘The general has influence,’ said Clogston. ‘He might be able to—’

‘No, I’m not buying into this,’ said Tonker. ‘It’s a gooey little lie.
To hell with them.’

‘Lofty?’ said Polly.

Lofty struck a match, and stared at it. She could find matches anywhere.

There was another _crump_, high above.

‘Maladict?’ said Polly.

‘Llet tthe bball rroll. II ssay nno.’

‘And you, lieutenant?’ Clogston asked.

‘It’s dishonourable,’ said Blouse.

‘Could be problems for you if you don’t accept, though. With your
career.’

‘I suspect I haven’t got one, major, whatever happens. No, I will not
live a lie. I know, now, that I’m not a hero. I’m just someone who
wanted to be one.’

‘Thank you, sir,’ said Polly. ‘Er . . . Jade?’

‘One of der trolls what arrested me hit me with his club an’ I frew a
table at him,’ said Jade, looking at the floor.

‘That was mistreatment of a pris—’ Blouse began, but Clogston said: ‘No,
lieutenant, I know something about trolls. They are very . . . physical.
So . . . he’s a rather attractive lad, is he, private?’

‘I got a good feelin’ about him,’ said Jade, blushing. ‘So I don’t want
to be sent home. Nothin’ for me there, anyway.’

‘Private Igor . . . ina?’ said Blouse.

‘I think we ought to give in,’ said Igorina.

‘Why?’ said Polly.

‘Because Wazzer’s dying.’ She raised a hand. ‘No, _please_ don’t cluster
round. Give her air, at least. She hasn’t eaten. I can’t get any water
down her at all.’ She looked up with red-rimmed eyes. ‘I don’t know what
to _do_!’

‘The Duchess talked to her,’ said Polly. ‘You all heard. And you know
what we saw down in the crypt.’

‘And I said I don’t believe any of that!’ said Tonker. ‘It’s her . . .
mind. They made her crazy enough. And we were all so tired, we’d see
_anything_. All that stuff about wanting to get to the High Command?
Well, here they are, and I don’t see any miracles. Do you?’

‘I don’t think she would have wanted us to give in,’ said Polly.

_No._

‘Did you hear that?’ said Polly, although she wasn’t certain that the
word had turned up in her head via her ears.

‘No, I didn’t!’ said Tonker. ‘I didn’t hear it!’

‘I don’t think we can accept this compromise, sir,’ said Polly to the
major.

‘Then I won’t,’ said Shufti promptly. ‘I don’t . . . this wasn’t . . . I
only came because . . . but . . . look, I’m staying with you. Erm . . .
what can they do to us, sir?’

‘Put you in a cell for a long time, probably,’ said the major. ‘They’re
being kind to you—’

‘Kind?’ said Polly.

‘Well, they think they’re being kind,’ said Clogston. ‘And they could be
a lot worse. And there’s a war on. They don’t want to look bad, but Froc
didn’t get to be a general by being nice. I have to warn you about that.
You’re still turning this down?’

Blouse looked round at his men. ‘I believe we are, major.’

‘Good,’ said Clogston, winking.

_Good_.

Clogston went back to his table and shuffled his papers. ‘The allegedly
accused, sir, regretfully turn down the offer.’

‘Yes, I thought they might,’ said Froc. ‘In that case, they are to be
returned to the cells. They will be dealt with later.’ Plaster showered
down as something hit the outer wall again. ‘This has gone quite far
enough!’

‘We won’t be sent to the cells!’ Tonker shouted.

‘Then that is mutiny, sir!’ said Froc. ‘And we know how to deal with
that!’

‘Excuse me, general, does that then mean the tribunal _does_ agree that
these ladies are soldiers?’ said Clogston.

General Froc glared at him. ‘Don’t you try to tie me up with procedural
nonsense, major!’

‘It’s hardly nonsense, sir, it’s the very basis—’

_Duck_.

The word was the faintest, merest suggestion in Polly’s head, but it
also seemed to be wired to her central nervous system. And not only
hers. The squad ducked, Igorina throwing herself across her patient’s
body.

Half the ceiling collapsed. The chandelier fell down and exploded in a
kaleidoscope of splintering prisms. Mirrors shattered. And then there
was, by comparison at least, silence, broken only by the thud of a few
late bits of plaster and the tinkle of a tardy shard.

_Now_ . . .

Footsteps approached the big doors at the end of the room, where the
guards were just struggling to their feet. The doors swung open.

Jackrum stood there, shining like the sunset. The light glinted off his
shako badge, polished to the point where it would blind the incautious
with its terrible gleam. His face was red, but his jacket was redder,
and his sergeant’s sash was the pure quill of redness, its very essence,
the red of dying stars and dying soldiers. Blood dripped off the
cutlasses thrust into his belt. The guards, still shaking, tried to
lower their pikes to bar his way.

‘Do not try it, lads, I beg you,’ said Jackrum. ‘Upon my oath I am not a
violent man, but do you think Sergeant Jackrum is going to be stopped by
a set of bleedin’ cutlery?’

The men looked at Jackrum, steaming with barely controlled rage, and
then at the astonished generals, and took an immediate decision on their
own desperate initiative.

‘Good lads,’ said Jackrum. ‘With your permission, General Froc?’

He did not wait for a reply but marched forward with parade-ground
precision. He came to boot-crashing attention in front of the senior
generals, still brushing plaster dust from their uniforms, and saluted
with the precision of a semaphore.

‘I beg to report, sir, that we now hold the main gates, sir! Took the
liberty of putting together a force of the Ins-and-Outs, the
Side-to-Sides and the Backwards-and-Forwards, sir, just in case, saw a
big cloud o’ flame and smoke over the place, and arrived at the gates
just as your lads did. Got ’em coming and going, sir!’

There was a general cheer, and General Kzupi leaned towards Froc. ‘In
view of this pleasing development, sir, perhaps we should hurry up and
close this—’

Froc waved him into silence. ‘Jackrum, you old rogue,’ he said, leaning
back in his chair. ‘I heard you were dead. How the devil are you?’

‘Fightin’ fit, sir!’ barked Jackrum. ‘Not dead at all, despite the hopes
of many!’

‘Glad to hear it, man. But, while your rosy face is a welcome sight at
any time, we are here to—’

‘Fourteen miles I carried you, sir!’ Jackrum roared, sweat pouring down
his face. ‘Pulled that arrow out of your leg, sir. Sliced that devil of
a captain who pushed an axe in your face, sir, and I’m glad to see the
scar’s looking well. Killed that poor sentry lad just to steal his water
bottle for you, sir. Looked into his dyin’ face, sir, for you. Never
asked for nothing in return, sir. Right, sir?’

Froc rubbed his chin and smiled. ‘Well, I seem to remember there was
that little matter of fudging some details, changing a few dates—’ he
murmured.

‘Don’t give me that bleedin’ slop, sir, with respect. That wasn’t for
me, that was for the army. For the Duchess, sir. And, yeah, I see a few
other gentlemen round this table who had reason to do the same little
service for me. For the Duchess, sir. And if you was to leave me one
sword I’d stand and fight any man in your army, sir, be he never so
young and full of mustard!’

In one movement he pulled a cutlass from his belt and brought it down on
the paperwork between Froc’s hands. It bit through into the wood of the
table, and stayed there.

Froc didn’t flinch. Instead he looked up and said calmly, ‘Hero though
you may be, sergeant, I fear that you have gone _too_ far.’

‘Have I gone the full fourteen miles yet, sir?’ said Jackrum.

For a moment there was no sound but that of the cutlass, vibrating to a
halt. Froc breathed out. ‘Very well,’ he said. ‘What is your request,
sergeant?’

‘I notes you have my little lads before you, sir! I’m hearing that they
are in a spot of _bother_, sir!’

‘The _girls_, Jackrum, are to be restrained in a place of safety. This
is no place for them. And that is my order, sergeant.’

‘I said to ’em when they signed up, sir, I said: if anyone drags you
away they’ll have to drag me away, too, sir!’

Froc nodded. ‘Very loyal of you, sergeant, and very much in your
character. Nevertheless—’

‘And I have information vital to these here deliberations, sir! There is
something I must tell you, sir!’

‘Well, by all means tell us, man!’ said Froc. ‘You don’t have to take
all—’

‘It requires that some of you gentlemen quit this room, sir,’ said
Jackrum, desperately. He was still at attention, still holding the
salute.

‘Now you do ask too much, Jackrum,’ said Froc. ‘These are loyal officers
of her grace!’

‘No doubt of it, sir! Upon my oath I am not a gossiping man, sir, but I
will speak my piece to those I choose, sir, or speak it to the world.
There’s ways to do that, sir, nasty new-fangled ways. Your choice, sir!’

At last, Froc coloured. He stood up abruptly. ‘Are you seriously telling
me that you’d—’

‘This is my famous last stand, sir!’ said Jackrum, saluting again. ‘Do
or die, sir!’

All eyes turned to Froc. He relaxed. ‘Oh, very well. It can’t do any
harm to listen to you, sergeant. God knows you’ve earned it. But make it
quick.’

‘Thank you, sir.’

‘But try this again and you’ll be on the biggest fizzer you can
imagine.’

‘No worry there, sir. Never been one for fizzers. I will by your leave
point to certain men . . .’

They were about half of the officers. They rose with greater or lesser
protest, but rise they did, under Froc’s sapphire glare, and filed out
into the corridor.

‘General, I protest!’ said a departing colonel. ‘We are being sent out
of the room like naughty children while these . . . females are—’

‘Yes, yes, Rodney, and if our friend the sergeant doesn’t have a damn
good explanation I’ll personally turn him over to you for punishment
detail,’ said Froc. ‘But he’s entitled to his last wild charge if any
man is. Go quietly, there’s a good chap, and keep the war going until we
get there. And have you finished this strange charade, sergeant?’ he
added, as the last of the officers left.

‘All but one last thing, sir,’ said Jackrum, and stamped over to the
guards. They were at attention already, but nevertheless contrived to
become more attentive. ‘You lads go outside this door,’ said the
sergeant. ‘No one is to come close, understand. And I know you boys
won’t try to eavesdrop, because of what’d happen to you if I ever found
that you had done so. Off you go, hup, hup, hup!’

He shut the doors behind them and the atmosphere changed. Polly couldn’t
quite detect how, but perhaps it was that the click of the doors had
said ‘This is our secret’ and everyone present was in on it.

Jackrum removed his shako and laid it gently on the table in front of
the general. Then he took off his coat and handed it to Polly, saying,
‘Hold this, Perks. It’s the property of her grace.’ He rolled up his
sleeves. He relaxed his enormous red braces. And then, to Polly’s horror
if not to her surprise, he brought out his paper screw of foul chewing
tobacco and his blackened penknife.

‘Oh, I say—’ a major began, before a colleague nudged him into silence.
Never had a man cutting a wad of black tobacco been the subject of such
rapt, horrified attention.

‘Things are going well outside,’ he said. ‘Shame you aren’t all out
there, eh? Still, the truth’s important too, right? And that’s what this
tribunal is for, no doubt about it. It must be important, the truth,
else you wouldn’t be here, am I right? ’course I am.’

Jackrum finished the cut, palmed the stuff into his mouth and got it
comfortable in a cheek, while the sounds of battle filtered through from
outside. Then he turned and walked towards the major who had just
spoken. The man cringed a little in his chair.

‘What’ve you got to say about the truth, Major Derbi?’ said Jackrum
conversationally. ‘Nothing? Well, then, what shall _I_ say? What shall I
say about a captain who turned and ran sobbing when we came across a
column of Zlobenians, deserting his own men? Shall I say that ol’
Jackrum tripped him up and pummelled him a bit and put the fear of . . .
Jackrum into him, and he went back and ’twas a famous victory he had
that day, over two enemies, one of them being in his own head. And he
came to ol’ Jackrum again, drunk with battle, and said more’n he ought
. . .’

‘You bastard,’ said the major softly.

‘Shall I tell the truth today . . . _Janet_?’ said Jackrum.

The sounds of battle were suddenly much louder. They poured into the
room like the water rushing to fill a hole in the ocean floor, but all
the sound in the world could not have filled that sudden, tremendous
silence.

Jackrum strolled on towards another man. ‘Good to see you here, Colonel
Cumabund!’ he said cheerfully. ‘O’ course, you were only Lieutenant
Cumabund when I was under your command. Plucky lad you were, when you
led us against that detachment of Kopelies. And then you took a nasty
sword wound in the fracas, or just above, and I got you through with rum
and cold water, and found that plucky you might be, but lad you weren’t.
Oh, how you gabbled away in your feverish delirium . . . Yes, you did.
That’s the truth . . . _Olga_.’

He stepped round the table and started to stroll along _behind_ the
officers; those he passed stared woodenly ahead, not daring to turn, not
daring to make any movement that would attract attention.

‘You could say I know _something_ about all of yez,’ he said. ‘Quite a
lot about some of you, just enough about most of you. A few of you,
well, I could write a book.’ He paused just behind Froc, who stiffened.

‘Jackrum, I—’ he began.

Jackrum put a hand on each of Froc’s shoulders. ‘Fourteen miles, sir.
Two nights, ’cos we lay up by day, the patrols were that thick. Cut
about pretty dreadful, you were, but you got better nursing from me than
any sawbones, I’d bet.’ He leaned forward until his mouth was level with
the general’s ear, and continued in a stage whisper: ‘What is there left
about you that I don’t know? So . . . are you really looking for the
truth . . . _Mildred_?’

The room was a museum of waxworks. Jackrum spat on the floor.

‘You cannot prove anything, sergeant,’ said Froc eventually, with the
calm of an icefield.

‘Well now, not as such. But they keep telling me this is the modern
world, sir. I don’t need proof, exactly. I know a man who’d have such a
tale to tell, and it’d be in Ankh-Morpork in a couple of hours.’

‘If you leave this room alive,’ said a voice.

Jackrum smiled his evillest smile, and bore down on the source of the
threat like an avalanche. ‘Ah! I thought one of yez would try that,
Chloe, but I note you never made it beyond major, and no wonder since
you try to bluff with no bleedin’ cards in your hand. Nice try, though.
But, first, I could take you to the bleedin’ cleaners before those
guards were back in here, upon my oath, and, second, you don’t know what
I’ve writ down and who else knows. I trained all you girls at one time
or another, and some of the cunning you got, some of the mustard, some
of the sense . . . well, you got it from me. Didn’t you? So don’t any of
you go thinking you can be artful about this, because when it comes to
cunning I am Mister Fox.’

‘Sergeant, sergeant, sergeant,’ said Froc wearily, ‘what is it you
_want_?’

Jackrum completed his circuit of the table and finished in front of it,
once again like a man before his judges.

‘Well, blow me down,’ he said quietly, looking along the row of faces.
‘You didn’t know, did you . . . you didn’t _know_. Is there a . . . a
_man_ among you that knew? You thought, every one of you, that you were
all alone. All alone. You poor devils. And look at you. More’n a third
of the country’s High Command. You made it on your own, ladies. What
could you have done if you’d acted tog—’

He stopped, and took a step towards Froc, who looked down at her cloven
paperwork. ‘How many did _you_ spot, Mildred?’

‘That will be “general”, sergeant. I’m still a general, sergeant. Or
“sir” will do. And your answer is: one or two. One or two.’

‘And you promoted them, did you, if they was as good as men?’

‘Indeed not, sergeant. What do you take me for? I promoted them if they
were _better_ than men.’

Jackrum opened his arms wide, like a ringmaster introducing a new act.
‘Then what about the lads I brought with me, sir? As cracking a bunch of
lads as I’ve ever seen.’ He cast a bloodshot eye around the table. ‘And
I’m good at weighing up a lad, as you all know. They’d be a credit to
your army, sir!’

Froc looked at her colleagues on either side. An unspoken question
harvested unsaid answers.

‘Yes, well,’ she said. ‘All seems clear to us, in the light of new
developments. When beardless lads dress up as gels, there’s no doubt
that people will get confused. And that’s what we’ve got here, sergeant.
Mere confusion. Mistaken identities. Much ado, in fact, about nothing.
Clearly they are boys, and may return home right now with an honourable
discharge.’

Jackrum chuckled and stuck out a palm, flexing the fingers upwards like
a man bargaining. Once again, there was the communion of spirits.

‘Very well. They can, if they wish, continue in the army,’ said Froc.
‘With discretion, of course.’

‘No, sir!’

Polly stared at Jackrum, and then realized the words had, in fact, come
from her own mouth.

Froc raised her eyebrows. ‘What _is_ your name again?’ she said.

‘Corporal Perks, sir!’ said Polly, saluting.

She watched Froc’s face settle into an expression of condescending
benevolence. If she uses the words ‘my dear’ I shall _swear_, she
thought.

‘Well, my dear—’

‘Not your dear, sir or madam,’ said Polly. In the theatre of her mind
The Duchess Inn burned to a cinder and her old life peeled away, black
as charcoal, and she was flying, ballistic, too fast and too high and
unable to stop. ‘I am a soldier, general. I signed up. I kissed the
Duchess. I don’t think generals call their soldiers “my dear”, do they?’

Froc coughed. The smile remained, but had the decency to be a bit more
restrained. ‘And private soldiers don’t talk like that to generals,
young lady, so we’ll let that pass, shall we?’

‘Just here, in this room, I don’t know what passes and what stays, sir,’
said Polly. ‘But it seems to me that if you are still a general then I’m
still a corporal, sir. I can’t speak for the others, but the reason I’m
holding out, general, is that I kissed the Duchess and she knew what I
was and she . . . didn’t turn away, if you understand me.’

‘Well said, Perks,’ said Jackrum.

Polly plunged on. ‘Sir, a day or two ago I’d have rescued my brother and
gone off home and I’d have thought it a job well done. I just wanted to
be safe. But now I see there’s no safety while there’s all this . . .
this stupidity. So I think I’ve got to stay and be a part of it. Er
. . . try to make it less stupid, I mean. And I want to be me, not
Oliver. I kissed the Duchess. We all did. You can’t tell us we didn’t
and you can’t tell us it doesn’t count, because it’s between us and
her—’

‘You all kissed the Duchess,’ said a voice. It had an . . . echo.

_You all kissed the Duchess_ . . .

‘Did you think that it meant nothing? That it was just a kiss?’

_Did you think it meant nothing_ . . .

     . . . _just a kiss_ . . .

The whispered words washed against the walls like surf, and came back
stronger, in harmonies.

DID YOU KISS MEANT NOTHING MEANT A KISS JUST THINK A KISS MEANT A KISS
. . .

Wazzer was standing up. The squad stood petrified as she walked
unsteadily past them. Her eyes focused on Polly.

‘How good to wear a body again,’ she said. ‘And to breathe. Breathing is
wonderful . . .’

_How good_ . . .

 _To breathe wonderful a body again to breathe . . ._

Something was in Wazzer’s face. Her features were all there, all
correct, her nose was as pointed and as red, her cheekbones as hollow
. . . but there were subtle changes. She held up a hand and flexed her
fingers.

‘Ah,’ she said. ‘So . . .’ There was no echo this time, but the voice
was stronger and deep. No one would ever have said that Wazzer’s voice
had been attractive, but this one was. She turned to Jackrum, who
dropped on to his fat knees and whipped off his shako.

‘Sergeant Jackrum, I _know_ that you know who I am. You have waded
through seas of blood for me. Perhaps we should have done better things
with your life, but at least your sins were soldier’s sins, and not the
worst of them, at that. You are hereby promoted to sergeant major, and a
better candidate for the job I have never met. You are steeped in
deviousness, cunning and casual criminality, Sergeant Jackrum. You
should do well.’

Jackrum, eyes cast down, raised a knuckle to his forehead. ‘. . . not
worthy, your grace,’ he muttered.

‘Of course you aren’t.’ The Duchess looked around. ‘Now, where is my
army . . . ah.’ There was no echo at all in the voice now, and none of
Wazzer’s cowering and downcast eyes. She positioned herself directly in
front of Froc, who was staring with his mouth open.

‘General Froc, you must do one final service for me.’

The general glared. ‘Who the hell are you?’

‘You need to ask? As always, Jackrum thinks faster than you. You know
me. I am the Duchess Annagovia.’

‘But you are—’ one of the other officers began, but Froc held up a hand
again.

‘The voice . . . is familiar,’ she said, in a faraway whisper.

‘Yes. You remember the ball. I remember it, too. Forty years ago. You
were the youngest captain ever. We danced, stiffly in my case. I asked
you how long you had been a captain, and you said—’

‘Three days,’ breathed Froc, with her eyes shut.

‘And we ate Brandy Pillows, and a cocktail that I believe was called—’

‘Angel’s Tears,’ said Froc. ‘I kept the menu, your grace. And the dance
card.’

‘Yes,’ said the Duchess. ‘You did. And when old General Scaffer led you
away, he said, “That’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, my
boy.” But you were . . . so dedicated that you never had children . . .
my boy . . .’

 . . . _my boy . . . my boy_ . . .

‘I see heroes!’ said the Duchess, staring at the tableau of officers.
‘All of you gave up . . . much. But I demand more. Much more. Is there
any amongst you who for the sake of my memory will not die in battle?’
Wazzer’s head turned and looked along the row. ‘No. I see there is not.
And now I demand that you do what the ignorant might feel is the easier
thing. You must refrain from dying in battle. Revenge is not redress.
Revenge is a wheel, and it turns backwards. The dead are not your
masters.’

‘What is it you want of me, ma’am?’ Froc managed.

‘Call in your other officers. Make what truces are necessary, for now.
This body, this poor child, will lead you. I am weak, but I can move
small things. Thoughts, perhaps. I will leave her . . . something, a
light in the eye, a tone in the voice. Follow her. You must invade.’

‘Certainly! But how—’

‘You must invade Borogravia! In the name of sanity, you must go home.
The winter is coming, the trusting animals are not fed, old men die of
cold, women mourn, the country corrodes. Fight Nuggan, because he is
nothing now, nothing but the poisonous echo of all your ignorance and
pettiness and malicious stupidity. Find yourself a worthier god. And let
. . . me . . . go! All those prayers, all those entreaties . . . to me!
Too many hands clasped, that could more gainfully answer your prayers by
effort and resolve! And what was I? Just a rather stupid woman when I
was alive. But you believed I watched over you, and listened to you
. . . and so I had to, I had to listen, knowing that there was no help
. . . I wish people would not be so careless about what they believe.
Go. Invade the one place you’ve never conquered. And these women will
help. Be proud of them. And, lest you think to twist my meaning, lest
you doubt . . . let me, as I leave, return to you this gift. Remember. A
kiss.’

 . . . _a kiss_ . . .

   . . . _a kiss a kiss return to you kiss_ . . .

     . . . _remember_ . . .

As one woman, as one man, the crowd in the room reached up hesitantly to
their left cheek. And Wazzer folded up, very gently, collapsing like a
sigh.

Froc was the first to speak. ‘This is . . . I think we need to . . .’
She faltered into silence.

Jackrum got to his feet, brushed the dust off his shako, placed it on
his head and saluted. ‘Permission to speak, sir?’ he said.

‘Oh, good heaven, Jackrum!’ said Froc distractedly. ‘At a time like
this? Yes, yes . . .’

‘What are your orders, sir?’

‘Orders?’ Froc blinked, and looked around. ‘Orders, orders . . . yes.
Well, I _am_ the commander, I _can_ request a . . . yes, I can request a
truce, sergeant—’

‘That’s sergeant major, sir,’ said Jackrum. ‘Right you are, sir, I’ll
organize a runner to go to the alliance.’

‘I suppose a . . . white flag would be—’

‘Good as done, sir. Leave it to me,’ said Jackrum, radiating efficiency.

‘Yes, of course . . . Er, before, before we go any further . . . ladies
and gentlemen, I . . . er . . . some of the things said here . . . the
whole issue of women joining as . . . women . . . obviously . . .’ She
raised her hand to her cheek again, in a kind of wonderment. ‘They are
welcome. I . . . salute them. But for those of us that went before,
perhaps it is not . . . not yet the time. You understand?’

‘What?’ said Polly.

‘Lips sealed, sir!’ said Jackrum. ‘You can leave it all to me, sir!
Captain Blouse’s squad, attention! You will obtain uniforms! You can’t
go around still dressed as washerwomen, oh dear me!’

‘We _are_ soldiers?’ said Polly.

‘O’ course you are, otherwise I wouldn’t be shouting at you, you
’orrible little woman! The world’s turned upside down! It’s a bit more
important than you right now, eh? You’ve got what you’re after, right?
Now get hold of a uniform, find yourself a shako and wipe your face, at
least. _You_ are taking the official truce to the enemy.’

‘Me, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Right! Just as soon as the officers have done the official letter.
Tonker, Lofty . . . see what you can find for Perks to wear. Perks,
don’t be cowed, and bull yourself up. The rest of you, hurry up and
wait!’

‘Sergeant Jac— er, sergeant major?’ said Blouse.

‘Yessir?’

‘I’m _not_ a captain, you know.’

‘Are you not?’ said Jackrum, grinning. ‘Well, leave it to Jackrum, sir.
We shall see what the day brings, eh? Minor point, sir. I should lose
the dress if I was you!’

Jackrum marched off, his inflated chest as red as a robin’s and twice as
threatening. He shouted at orderlies, harried guards, saluted officers
and, despite everything, hammered the blade of purpose out of the
red-hot steel of panic. He was a sergeant major in a roomful of confused
ruperts, and he was happier than a terrier in a barrel of rats.

Stopping a battle is much harder than starting it. Starting it only
requires you to shout ‘Attack!’ but when you want to stop it, everyone
is busy.

Polly could _feel_ the news spreading. _They’re girls!_ The orderlies
scuttling in and out once more kept staring at them, as if they were
some kind of strange insects. I wonder how many Jackrum missed, Polly
thought. I wonder . . .

Bits of uniform turned up. Jade found some trousers that fitted by
locating a clerk who was Polly’s height, lifting him up and pulling them
off him. A jacket was acquired. Lofty even stole a shako of the right
size and polished the badge with her sleeve until it gleamed. Polly was
just doing up her belt when she spotted a figure on the far side of the
room. She’d completely forgotten about _him_.

She pulled the belt tight and thrust the leather through the buckle as
she walked and then strode through the crowds of figures. Strappi saw
her coming, but it was too late. There was no escape short of running,
and captains didn’t run from corporals. He stood his ground, like a
rabbit hypnotized by the approaching vixen, and raised his hands as she
approached.

‘Now then, Perks, I’m a captain and I had a job to—’ he began.

‘And how long do you think you’ll hold that rank, now, _sir_?’ hissed
Polly. ‘When I tell the general about our little fight? And how you
sicked the Prince on to us? And how you bullied Wazzer? And about my
hair, you sticky little miserable apology for a man! Shufti’s a better
man than you and she’s pregnant!’

‘Oh, we knew there were women getting in,’ said Strappi. ‘We just didn’t
know how far the rot went—’

‘You took my hair because you thought it meant something to me,’ hissed
Polly. ‘Well, you can keep it! I’ll grow some more, and no one is going
to stop me, understand? Oh, and one other thing. This is how far the rot
goes!’

It was a blow rather than a slap, and it knocked him down so hard that
he rolled. But he was Strappi, and staggered upright with a finger
pointed for vengeance.

‘She struck a superior officer!’ he screamed.

A few heads turned. They looked at Strappi. They looked at Polly. Then
they looked back grinning to what they had been doing.

‘I should run away again, if I was you,’ said Polly. She turned on her
heel, feeling the heat of his impotent fury.

As she was about to rejoin Jade and Maladict, someone touched her arm.
She spun round.

‘What? Oh . . . sorry, Major Clogston,’ she said. She felt she wouldn’t
be able to deal with Strappi again, not without committing murder. That
would probably get her into trouble, even now.

‘I should like to thank you for a most enjoyable day,’ said the major.
‘I did my best, but I think we were all . . . outclassed.’

‘Thank you, sir,’ said Polly.

‘This was a pleasure, Corporal Perks,’ said Clogston. ‘I shall watch
your future career with interest and envy. Congratulations. And since in
here protocol seems to be flapping loose, I will shake you by the hand.’

They shook. ‘And now, we have duties,’ said Major Clogston, as Jade
arrived with a white sheet on a pole. ‘Oh, and by the way . . . my name
is Christine. And, you know, I really don’t think I could get used to
wearing a dress again . . .’

Maladict and Jade were chosen to see Polly through the castle, a troll
because a troll commands respect and a vampire because a vampire demands
it. There were groans and cheers as they elbowed their way along the
passages, because news had already got around. That was another reason
for taking Jade. Trolls could push.

‘Okay,’ said Jackrum, bringing up the rear. ‘At the bottom of these
steps there’s a door, and beyond that door is enemy territory. Put the
white flag out _first_. Important safety tip.’

‘Can’t you come with us, sarge?’

‘Hah, me? I dare say there’s a few people out there who’d take a pot
shot at me white flag or no. Don’t you worry. The word’s gone out.’

‘What word’s that, sarge?’

Jackrum leaned closer. ‘They ain’t gonna shoot a girl, Perks!’

‘You _told_ them?’

‘Let’s just say that news gets around fast,’ said Jackrum. ‘Grab the
advantage. And I’ll find your brother while you’re gone, upon my oath.
Oh, one other thing . . . look at me, Perks.’ Polly turned, in the
crowded, jostling corridor. Jackrum’s eyes twinkled. ‘I know I can trust
you, Perks. I’d trust you like I’d trust myself. Best of luck. And make
the most of it, lad. Kissin’ don’t last!’

Well, that couldn’t be plainer, Polly thought, as the armed men by the
door beckoned them forward.

‘Stick to the walls, okay, ladies? And be quick with that rag!’

The heavy door swung open. Half a dozen arrows bounced and pinwheeled
along the corridor. Another one tore through the flag. Polly waved it
desperately. She heard distant shouting, and then cheers.

‘Okay, go!’ said a guard, pushing her forward.

She stepped out into the sudden daylight and, to make sure, waved the
flag overhead a few more times. There were men in the courtyard and
lining the battlements around it. There were bodies, too.

A captain, with blood soaking through his jacket, stepped across the
fallen and held out his hand. ‘You may give that to me, soldier,’ he
said.

‘No, sir. I must deliver it to your commander, and wait for his reply,
sir.’

‘Then you give it to me, soldier, and I will bring you back the reply.
You have surrendered, after all.’

‘No. This is a truce. That’s not the same thing. I have to hand this
over personally and you aren’t big enough.’ A thought hit her. ‘I demand
to take this to Commander Vimes!’

The captain stared at her, and then looked closer. ‘Aren’t you one of
those—’

‘Yes,’ said Polly.

‘And you locked them in chains and threw the key away?’

‘Yes,’ said Polly, seeing her life start to flash past her eyes.

‘And they had to hop miles with shackles on and no clothes?’

‘Yes!’

‘And you’re just . . . _women_?’

‘Yes!’ said Polly, letting the ‘just’ go for now.

The captain leaned closer and spoke while trying not to move his lips.
‘Dan gug show. Ell done. Agout time soes arragunk arsetards ere aken own
a eg!’ He leaned back. ‘Commander Vimes it is, then. Follow me, miss.’

Polly felt hundreds of eyes on her as the squad was let into the inner
keep. There were one or two wolf whistles, because there were more
soldiers in there, including quite a few trolls. Jade bent down,
snatched up a rock and hurled it at one of them, hitting him between the
eyes.

‘No one move!’ shouted Maladict, waving his hands urgently as a hundred
men raised their weapons. ‘That was the troll version of blowing a
kiss!’

And, indeed, the troll who had been hit was waving at Jade, a little
unsteadily.

‘Can we knock it off with the lovey-dovey, please?’ said Polly to Jade.
‘The soft people are likely to get the wrong idea.’

‘It’s stopped the whistling, though,’ Maladict observed.

More people watched them as they climbed flight after flight of stone
steps. No one could take this place, Polly could see that. Every flight
was seen by another one higher up, every visitor would be sighted on
before she’d even glimpsed a face.

A figure stepped out of the shadows as they reached the next floor. It
was a young woman, in old-fashioned leather and mail armour, with a
breastplate. She had long, very fair hair; for the first time in weeks,
Polly felt a twinge of envy.

‘Thank you, captain, I’ll take over from here,’ she said, and nodded to
Polly. ‘Good evening, Corporal Perks . . . if you would follow me,
please?’

‘She’s a woman! And a sergeant!’ Maladict whispered.

‘Yes, I know,’ said Polly.

‘But she gave an order to that captain!’

‘Maybe she’s a political . . .’

‘And she’s _obviously_ female!’

‘I’m not blind, Mal,’ said Polly.

‘I’m not deaf, either,’ said the woman, turning and smiling. ‘My name is
Angua. If you will wait here, I’ll have some coffee sent in. There’s a
bit of an argument going on in there at the moment.’

They were in a sort of anteroom, not much more than a widened area of
corridor with a few benches. There were big double doors at the far end,
behind which voices were being raised. Angua left.

‘Just like that?’ said Maladict. ‘What’s to stop us taking over the
place?’

‘All those men with crossbows we passed on the way up?’ said Polly. Why
us? she thought, looking blankly at the wall.

‘Oh, yes. Those. Yes. Er . . . Poll?’

‘Yes?’

‘I’m actually Maladicta.’ She sat back. ‘There! I’ve told someone!’

‘Dat’s nice,’ said Jade.

‘Oh, good,’ said Polly. _I’d be going out to give the latrines their
afternoon swill about now_, she thought. _This has got to be better than
that, right?_

‘I thought I did pretty well,’ Maladicta went on. ‘Now, I know what
you’re thinking. You’re thinking: vampires have a pretty good time of it
whatever sex they are, right? But it’s the same everywhere. Velvet
dresses, underwired nightgowns, acting crazy all the time, and don’t
let’s even go near the whole “bathing in virgin’s blood” thing. You get
taken a lot more seriously if they think you’re male.’

‘Right,’ said Polly. _All in all, it’s been a long day. A bath would be
nice._

‘I thought I did pretty well right up until the whole coffee thing. A
necklace of the roast beans, that’d be the thing. I’ll be better
prepared another time.’

‘Yeah,’ said Polly. ‘Good idea. With real soap.’

‘Soap? How would soap work?’

‘What? Oh . . . sorry,’ said Polly.

‘Did you hear _anything_ I said?’

‘Oh, that. Yes. Thank you for telling me.’

‘Is that _it_ ?’

‘Yes,’ said Polly. ‘You’re you. That’s good. I’m me, whoever I am.
Tonker’s Tonker. It’s all just . . . people. Look, a week ago the high
spot of my day was reading the new graffiti in the men’s latrines. I
think you’d agree that a lot has happened since then. I don’t think I’m
going to be surprised at anything any more. The coffee-bean necklace
sounds good, by the way.’ She drummed her feet on the floor impatiently.
‘Right now, I just wish they’d hurry up in there.’

They sat and listened, and then Polly became aware of a little column of
smoke coming from behind a bench on the other side of the space. She
walked over and peered over the back. A man was lying there, head on one
arm, smoking a cigar. He nodded when he saw Polly’s face.

‘They’re going to be ages yet,’ he said.

‘Aren’t you that sergeant I saw in the old kitchen? Making faces behind
Lord Rust from Ankh-Morpork?’

‘I was _not_ making faces, miss. That’s how I _always_ look when Lord
Rust is talking. And I _was_ a sergeant once, it’s true, but, look, no
stripes.’

‘Make der faces once too often?’ said Jade.

The man laughed. He hadn’t shaved today, by the look of it. ‘Something
like that, yes. Come along to my office, it’s warmer. I only came out
here because people complain about the smoke. Don’t worry about that lot
in there, they can wait. I’m only down the passage.’

They followed him. The door was, indeed, only a few steps away. The man
pushed it open, walked across the little room beyond, and sat down in a
chair. The table in front of it overflowed with papers.

‘I think we can get enough food up here to see you through the winter,’
he said, picking up a sheet of paper apparently at random. ‘Grain’s a
bit short but we’ve got a handy surplus of white drumhead cabbage, keeps
wonderfully, full of vitamins and minerals . . . but you might want to
keep your windows open, if you follow me. Don’t stare. I _know_ the
country’s a month away from starvation.’

‘But I haven’t even shown this letter to anyone!’ Polly protested. ‘You
don’t know what we—’

‘I don’t have to,’ said the man. ‘This is about food and mouths. Good
grief, we don’t _have_ to fight you. Your country is going to fall over
anyway. Your fields are overgrown, most of your farmers are old men, the
bulk of the grub goes to the army. And armies don’t do much for
agriculture except marginally raise the fertility of the battlefield.
The honour, the pride, the glory . . . none of that matters. This war
stops, or Borogravia dies. Do you understand?’

Polly remembered the gale-swept fields, the old people salvaging what
they could . . .

‘We’re just messengers,’ she said. ‘I can’t negotiate—’

‘You know your god’s dead?’ said the man. ‘Nothing left but a voice,
according to some of our priests. The last three Abominations were
against rocks, ears and accordion players. Okay, I might be with him on
the last one, but . . . rocks? Hah! We can advise you if you’re going to
look for a new one, by the way. Om’s very popular at the moment. Very
few abominations, no special clothing, and hymns you can sing in the
bath. You won’t get Offler the Crocodile God up here with your winters,
and the Unorthodox Potato Church is probably a bit too uncomplicated
for—’

Polly started to laugh. ‘Look, sir, I’m just a . . . what _is_ your
name, please?’

‘Sam Vimes. Special envoy, which is kind of like an ambassador but
without the little gold chocolates.’

‘Vimes the Butcher?’ said Maladicta.

‘Oh, yes. I’ve heard that one,’ said Vimes, grinning. ‘Your people
haven’t really mastered the fine art of propaganda. And I’m telling you
because— well, have you _heard_ of Om?’

They shook their heads.

‘No? Well, in the _Old Book of Om_ there’s a story about some city full
of wickedness, and Om decided to destroy it with holy fire, this being
back in the old smiting days before he’d got religion. But Bishop Horn
protested about this plan, and Om said he’d spare the city if the bishop
could find one good man. Well, the bishop knocked on every door, and
turned up empty-handed. It turned out, after the place had been reduced
to a glass plain, that there were probably plenty of good people there
and, being good, they weren’t the sort to admit it. Death by modesty, a
terrible thing. And you, ladies, are the only Borogravians I know much
about, apart from the military who, frankly, aren’t chatty. You don’t
appear to be as insane as your country’s foreign policy. You’re the one
piece of international goodwill it has. A bunch of young boys outwitting
crack cavalrymen? Kicking the Prince in the fork? People at home liked
that. And now it turns out that you’re girls? They’ll _love_ that. Mr de
Worde is going to have fun with that when he finds out.’

‘But we don’t have any power! We can’t negotiate a—’

‘What does Borogravia want? Not the country. I mean the people.’

Polly opened her mouth to reply, and then shut it again and _thought_
about the answer. ‘To be left alone,’ she said. ‘By everybody. For a
while, anyway. We can change things.’

‘You’ll accept the food?’

‘We are a proud country.’

‘What are you proud of?’

It came swiftly, like a blow, and Polly realized how wars happened. You
took that shock that had run through her, and let it boil.

. . . _it may be corrupt, benighted and stupid, but it’s ours_ . . .

Vimes was watching her face. ‘From this desk here,’ he said, ‘the only
thing your country has to be proud of right now is you women.’

Polly stayed silent. She was still trying to cope with the anger. It
made it worse to know that he was right. _We have our pride. And that’s
what we’re proud of. We’re proud of being proud_ . . .

‘Very well, then, will you _buy_ some food?’ said Vimes, watching her
carefully. ‘On credit? I suppose you still have someone in your country
who knows about the kind of international affairs that don’t involve
edged weapons?’

‘People would accept that, yes,’ said Polly hoarsely.

‘Good. I’ll send a clacks back tonight.’

‘And why would you be so generous, Mr Ankh-Morpork?’

‘Because I’m from a wonderfully warm-hearted city, corporal . . . hah,
no, I can’t say that and keep a straight face,’ said Vimes. ‘Do you want
to know the truth? Most people in Ankh-Morpork hadn’t even heard of your
country until the clacks went down. There’s dozens of little countries
round here selling one another hand-painted clogs or beer made from
turnips. Then they knew you as the bloody mad idiots who fight everyone.
Now they know you as . . . well, people who do just what they’d do. And
tomorrow they’ll laugh. And there’re other people, people who sit and
think about the future every day, who believe it’s worth a little to be
friends with a country like that.’

‘Why?’ said Maladicta suspiciously.

‘Because Ankh-Morpork is a friend to all freedom-loving people
everywhere!’ said Vimes. ‘Gods, it must be the way I tell ’em. _Ze chzy
Brogocia proztfik!_’ He saw their blank expressions. ‘Sorry, I’ve been
away from home too long. And frankly, I’d rather be back there.’

‘But why did you say you were a cherry pancake?’ said Polly.

‘Didn’t I say I am a citizen of Borogravia?’

‘No. _Brogocia_ is the cherry pancake, _Borogvia_ is the country.’

‘Well, I made the effort, at least. Look, we’d rather Prince Heinrich
wasn’t ruler of two countries. That’d make one quite big country, much
bigger than the other ones round here. So it’d probably get bigger
still. He wants to be like Ankh-Morpork, you see. But what he means is
he wants power, and influence. He doesn’t want to earn them, he doesn’t
want to grow into them or learn the hard way how to use them. He just
wants them.’

‘That’s playing politics!’ said Maladicta.

‘No. It’s just telling the truth. Make peace with him, by all means.
Just leave the road and the towers alone. You’ll get the food anyway, at
whatever price. Mr de Worde’s article will see to that.’

‘You sent the coffee,’ said Polly.

‘Oh, yes. That was Corporal Buggy Swires, my eye in the sky. He’s a
gnome.’

‘And you set a werewolf on us?’

‘Well, set is a bit strong. Angua followed you, just to be on the safe
side. She’s a werewolf, yes.’

‘The girl we met? She didn’t look like one!’

‘Well, they don’t, usually,’ said Vimes. ‘Right up until the moment when
they do, if you see what I mean. And she was following you because I was
looking for anything that’d stop thousands of people dying. And that’s
not politics either,’ said Vimes. He stood up. ‘And now, ladies, I have
to go and present your document to the alliance leaders.’

‘You came out for a smoke at the right time, didn’t you?’ said Polly,
slowly and carefully. ‘You _knew_ we were on our way, and you made sure
you’d get to us first.’

‘Of course. Can’t leave this to a bunch of . . . oh, yes . . . ruperts.’

‘Where is my brother, Mister Vimes?’ said Polly stiffly.

‘You seem very sure I know . . .’ said Vimes, not looking her in the
face.

‘I’m certain you do,’ said Polly.

‘Why?’

‘Because no one else does!’

Vimes stubbed out his cigar. ‘Angua was right about you,’ he said. ‘Yes,
I, er, _arranged_ for him to be put in what I like to call “protective
custody”. He’s fine. Angua will take you to him now, if you like. Your
brother, possibility of revenge, blackmail, who knows what . . . I
thought he might be safer if I knew exactly who held the keys.’

The end of the journey, Polly thought. But it wasn’t, not any more. She
got the distinct impression that the man opposite was reading her
thoughts.

‘That’s what all this was about, isn’t it?’ he said.

‘No, sir. It’s just how it started,’ said Polly.

‘Well, it continues like this,’ said Vimes. ‘This is going to be a busy
day. Right now I shall take this offer of a truce into the room down the
passage and present it to the very important men’ – his voice went flat
to say those words – ‘who are discussing what to do about Borogravia.
You’ll get a truce, the food, and probably some other help.’

‘How do you know that?’ said Polly. ‘They haven’t discussed it!’

‘Not yet. But, as I said . . . I used to be a sergeant. Angua!’

The door opened. Angua came in. As Vimes had said, you couldn’t tell who
was a werewolf until you found out . . .

‘And now I’d better have a shave before I go to see the very important
men,’ said Vimes. ‘People set a lot of store by shaving.’

Polly felt embarrassed walking down the steps with Sergeant Angua. How
did you start a conversation? ‘So you’re a werewolf, then?’ would be
sort of idiotic. She was glad that Jade and Maladicta had been left in
the waiting room.

‘Yes, I am,’ said Angua.

‘But I didn’t say it!’ Polly burst out.

‘No, but I’m used to situations like this. I’ve learned to recognize the
way people don’t say things. Don’t worry.’

‘You followed us,’ said Polly.

‘Yes.’

‘So you must’ve known we weren’t men.’

‘Oh, yes,’ said Angua. ‘My sense of smell is much better than my
eyesight, and I’ve got sharp eyes. Humans are smelly creatures. For what
it’s worth, though, I wouldn’t have told Mister Vimes if I hadn’t heard
you talking to one another. Anyone could have _heard_ you, you don’t
need to be a werewolf for that. Everyone’s got secrets they don’t want
known. Werewolves are a bit like vampires in that way. We’re tolerated
. . . if we’re careful.’

‘_That_ I can understand,’ said Polly. So are we, she thought.

Angua stopped by a heavy, studded door. ‘He’s in here,’ she said,
producing a key and turning it in the lock. ‘I’ll go back and chat to
the others. Come and find me when you’re ready . . .’

Polly stepped inside, heart pounding, and there was Paul. And there was
a buzzard, on a perch by the open window. And on the wall, where Paul
was working so intensely that his tongue was sticking out of the corner
of his mouth and he hadn’t even noticed the door opening, was another
buzzard, flying in the heart of the sunrise.

Right now, Polly could forgive Ankh-Morpork anything. Someone had found
Paul a box of coloured chalks.

The long day got longer. She had a kind of power. They all did. People
gave them space, watched them. The fighting had stopped and they were
the cause and no one knew exactly why.

There were lighter moments. They might have power, but General Froc gave
the orders. And General Froc might give the orders, but it was
permissible to suppose that it was Sergeant-major Jackrum who
anticipated them.

And perhaps that was why Shufti asked Polly and Tonker to go with her,
and they were ushered into a room where a couple of guards stood on
either side of a sheepish young man called Johnny who had fair hair and
blue eyes and a gold earring and his trousers round his knees in case
Shufti wanted to check his other distinguishing feature.

He also had a black eye.

‘This the one?’ said Major Clogston, who was leaning against the wall
eating an apple. ‘The general has asked me to tell you that there will
be a dowry of five hundred crowns, with the army’s compliments.’

Johnny brightened up slightly when he heard that. Shufti gave him a long
and careful look.

‘No,’ she said at last, turning away. ‘That’s not him.’

Johnny opened his mouth, and Polly snapped: ‘No one asked you to speak,
private!’ And, such was the nature of the day, he shut up.

‘I’m afraid he’s the only candidate,’ said Clogston. ‘We’ve got any
amount of earrings, heads of fair hair, blue eyes and Johnnies – and,
surprisingly, a fair number of carbuncles. But he’s the only one with
everything. Are you sure?’

‘Positive,’ said Shufti, still staring at the boy. ‘My Johnny must have
been killed.’

Clogston walked over and lowered her voice. ‘In that case, uh, the
general did say, informally, that a marriage certificate, a ring and a
widow’s pension could be arranged,’ she said.

‘Can she do that?’ whispered Polly.

‘For one of you? Today? You’ll be amazed what can be done,’ said
Clogston. ‘Don’t think too badly of her. She means well. She’s a very
_practical_ man.’

‘No,’ said Shufti. ‘I . . . it’s . . . well, no. Thank you, but no.’

‘Are you sure?’ said Polly.

‘Positive,’ said Shufti, looking defiant. Since she was not naturally a
defying kind of person it was not quite the look that she thought it was
and it ought to have been, having overtones of haemorrhoid sufferer, but
the effort was there.

Clogston stepped back. ‘Well, if you’re certain, private? Fair enough,
then. Take that man away, sergeant.’

‘Just a moment,’ said Shufti. She walked over to the bewildered Johnny,
stood in front of him, held out her hand and said: ‘Before they take you
away again I want my sixpence back, you son of a bitch!’

Polly held out her hand to Clogston, who shook it and smiled. There had
been another little victory, of sorts. If the landslide is big enough,
even square pebbles will roll.

Polly headed back to the rather larger cell that had been made available
as the women’s barracks, or at least the barracks for the official
women. Men, grown men, had fallen over themselves to put cushions in
there, and bring in wood for the fire. It was all very strange. Polly
felt they were being treated as something dangerous and fragile, like,
say, a huge and wonderful jar full of poison. She turned the corner into
the big courtyard and there was de Worde with Mr Chriek. There was no
escaping them. They were definitely people looking for someone.

The man gave her a look in which reproach was mingled with hope. ‘Er
. . . so you’re women, then?’ he said.

‘Er, yes,’ said Polly.

De Worde took out his notebook.

‘This is an _amazing_ story,’ he said. ‘You really fought your way here
and got in disguised as washerwomen?’

‘Well, we _were_ women, and we did some washing,’ said Polly. ‘I suppose
it was quite a cunning disguise, really. We got in by _not_ being
disguised, you could say.’

‘General Froc and Captain Blouse say they’re very proud of you,’ de
Worde went on.

‘Oh, he _has_ got promoted, then?’ said Polly.

‘Yes, and Froc said you did wonderfully well, for women.’

‘Yes, I suppose we did,’ said Polly. ‘Yes. Very well, for women.’

‘The general went on to say . . .’ de Worde consulted his notebook,
‘that you are a credit to the women of your country. I wonder if you’d
care to comment?’

He looked innocent, so possibly he didn’t understand the raging argument
that had just broken out in Polly’s head. _A credit to the women of your
country. We’re proud of you._ Somehow those words locked you away, put
you in your place, patted you on the head and dismissed you with a
sweetie. On the other hand, you had to start somewhere . . .

‘That’s very nice of him,’ said Polly. ‘But we just want to get the job
done and go home. That’s what soldiers want.’ She thought for a moment,
and then added: ‘And hot sweet tea.’ To her amazement, he wrote this
down.

‘Just one last question, miss: do you think the world would be a
different place if more women were soldiers?’ de Worde asked. He was
smiling again, she noted, so this was probably a joky kind of question.

‘Oh, I think you’d have to ask General Froc that,’ said Polly. And I’d
like to watch her expression if you do . . .

‘Yes, but what do you think, miss?’

‘That’s corporal, please.’

‘Sorry, corporal . . . and?’

The pencil was hovering. Around it, the world turned. It wrote things
down, and then they got everywhere. The pen might not be mightier than
the sword, but maybe the printing press was heavier than the siege
weapon. Just a few words can change everything . . .

‘Well,’ said Polly, ‘I—’

There was a sudden bustling around the gates at the other end of the
courtyard, and some cavalry officers arrived. They must have been
expected, because Zlobenian officers were converging in a great hurry.

‘Ah, I see the Prince is back,’ said de Worde. ‘He’s probably not going
to be happy about the truce. They sent some gallopers out to meet him.’

‘Can he do anything about it?’

De Worde shrugged. ‘He left some very senior officers here. It would be
rather shocking if he did.’

The tall figure had dismounted, and was striding towards Polly, or
rather, she realized, the big doorway next to her. Frantic clerks and
officers trailed after him, and were brushed off. But when a white
oblong was waved in front of his face by one man he grabbed it and
stopped so quickly that several other officers bumped into him.

‘Um,’ said de Worde. ‘The edition with the cartoon, I expect. Um.’

The paper was thrown down.

‘Yes, probably that was it,’ said de Worde.

Heinrich advanced. Now Polly could make out his expression. It was
thunderous. Beside her, de Worde turned over to a fresh page in his
notebook and cleared his throat.

‘You’re going to _talk_ to him?’ said Polly. ‘In _that_ mood? He’ll cut
you down!’

‘I have to,’ said de Worde. And, as the Prince and his retinue reached
the doorway he took a step forward and said, in a voice that cracked
slightly, ‘Your highness? I wonder if I could have a word?’

Heinrich turned to scowl at him, and saw Polly. For a moment, their
gazes locked.

The Prince’s adjutants knew their master. As the man’s hand flew to his
sword they closed on him in a mob, completely surrounding him, and there
was some frantic whispering, in which some rather louder injections from
Heinrich on the broad theme of ‘What?’ could be heard, followed by a
toccata on ‘The hell you say!’

The crowd parted again. The Prince slowly and carefully brushed some
dust off his spotless jacket, glanced only briefly at Otto and de Worde
and, to Polly’s horror, strolled towards her . . .

. . . with one white-gloved hand extended.

Oh no, she thought. But he’s cleverer than Vimes thinks he is, and he
can control his temper. And, suddenly, I’m _everyone’s_ mascot.

‘For the good of our _great_ countries,’ said Heinrich, ‘it is suggested
that we publicly shake the hand of friendship.’ He smiled again, or at
least allowed the corners of his mouth to turn up.

Because she could think of no other way out, Polly took the huge hand
and obediently shook it.

‘Oh, ver’ good,’ said Otto, grasping his picture box. ‘I can only take
zer vun, of course, because unfortunately I shall have to use flash.
Just vun moment . . .’

Polly was learning that an art form which happens in a fraction of a
second nevertheless needs a long time to take place, allowing a smile to
freeze into a mad grimace or, in the worst cases, a death rictus. Otto
muttered to himself as he adjusted the equipment. Heinrich and Polly
maintained the grip and stared at the picture box.

‘So,’ muttered the Prince, ‘the soldier boy _isn’t_ a soldier boy. That
is your good luck!’

Polly kept her fixed grin. ‘Do you often menace frightened women?’ she
said.

‘Oh, that was nothing! You are only a peasant girl, after all! What do
you know of life? And you showed spirit!’

‘Everyone say chiz!’ Otto commanded. ‘Vun, two, three . . . oh, bug—’

By the time the after-images had died away, Otto was back on his feet
again. ‘Vun day I hope to find a filter zat vorks,’ he muttered. ‘Thank
you, everyvun.’

‘That was for peace and goodwill between nations,’ said Polly, smiling
sweetly and letting go of the Prince’s hand. She took a step back. ‘And
this, your highness, is for me . . .’

Actually, she didn’t kick. Life was a process of finding out how far you
could go, and you could probably go too far in finding out how far you
could go. But a mere twitch of a leg was enough, just to see the idiot
collapse in the ridiculous, knock-kneed, protective crouch.

She marched away, singing inside. This was not a fairy-tale castle and
there was no such thing as a fairy-tale ending, but sometimes you could
threaten to kick the handsome prince in the ham-and-eggs.

And now, there was one _other_ little thing.

The sun was setting before Polly found Jackrum again, and blood-red
light shone through the high windows of the keep’s biggest kitchen. He
was sitting alone at a long table by the fire, in full uniform, and he
was eating a slab of thick bread plastered with pork dripping. A mug of
beer was not far from his other hand. He looked up as she approached,
and nodded companionably towards another chair. Around them, women ran
to and fro.

‘Pork drippin’ with salt and pepper, and a mug of beer,’ he said.
‘That’s the ticket. You can keep your _cuisine_. Want a slice?’ He waved
a hand at one of the kitchen girls who was dancing attendance on him.

‘Not right now, sarge.’

‘Sure?’ said Jackrum. ‘There’s an old sayin’: kissing don’t last,
cooking do. I hope that it’s one you don’t have cause to reflect upon.’

Polly sat down. ‘Kissing is lasting so far,’ she said.

‘Shufti get sorted out?’ said Jackrum. He finished the beer, snapped his
fingers at the serving girl, and pointed to the empty mug.

‘To her own satisfaction, sarge.’

‘Fair enough. You can’t get fairer. So what next, Perks?’

‘Dunno, sarge. I’ll go with Wa— with Alice and the army and see what
happens.’

‘Best of luck. Look after ’em, Perks, ’cos I ain’t coming,’ said
Jackrum.

‘Sarge?’ said Polly, shocked.

‘Well, looks like we’re going to be short by one war at present, eh?
Anyway, this is it. The end of the road. I’ve done my bit. Can’t go on
now. Shot me quiver with the general, and I dare say _he_ will be glad
to see the back of me. Besides, old age is creepin’ on. I killed five
poor devils when we attacked today, and afterwards I found meself
wonderin’ why. Not good, that. Time to get out before I blunt me own
edge.’

‘You’re sure, sarge?’

‘Yeah. Seems to me the ol’ “my country right or wrong” thing has had its
day. Time to put my feet up and find out what it is we’ve been fighting
for. Sure you won’t have any dripping? It’s got crunchy bits. That’s
what I call _style_, in dripping.’

Polly waved away the proffered slab of grease-smeared bread, and sat in
silence while Jackrum engulfed it.

‘Funny thing, really,’ she said, at last.

‘What’s that, Perks?’

‘Finding out that it’s not about you. You think you’re the hero, and it
turns out you’re really part of someone else’s story. Wazz— Alice will
be the one they remember. We just had to get her here.’

Jackrum said nothing but, as Polly would have predicted, pulled his
crumpled bag of chewing tobacco out of his pocket. She slipped a hand in
her own pocket and pulled out a small packet. Pockets, she thought.
We’ve got to hang on to pockets. A soldier needs pockets.

‘Try this, sarge,’ she said. ‘Go on, open it.’

It was a small, soft leather pouch, with a drawstring. Jackrum held it
up so that it twisted this way and that.

‘Well, Perks, upon my oath I am not a swearing man—’ he began.

‘No, you’re not. I’ve noticed,’ said Polly. ‘But that grubby old paper
was getting on my nerves. Why didn’t you ever get a proper pouch made
for yourself? One of the saddlers here sewed that up for me in half an
hour.’

‘Well, that’s life, isn’t it?’ said Jackrum. ‘Every day you think “ye
gods, it’s about time I had a new bag”, but then it all gets so busy you
end up using the old one. Thank you, Perks.’

‘Oh, I thought, “What can I give the man who has everything?” and that
was all I could afford,’ said Polly. ‘But you don’t have everything,
sarge. Sarge? You don’t, do you?’

She sensed him freeze over.

‘You stop right there, Perks,’ he said, lowering his voice.

‘I just thought you might like to show someone that locket of yours,
sarge,’ said Polly cheerfully. ‘The one round your neck. And don’t glare
at me, sarge. Oh, yeah, I could walk away and I’d never be sure, really
_sure_, and maybe you’d never show it to anyone else, ever, or tell them
the story, and one day we’ll both be dead and . . . well, what a waste,
eh?’

Jackrum glared.

‘Upon your oath, you are not a dishonest man,’ said Polly. ‘Good one,
sarge. You told people every day.’

Around them, beyond the dome, the kitchen buzzed with the busyness of
women. Women always seemed to be doing things with their hands – holding
babies, or pans, or plates, or wool, or a brush, or a needle. Even when
they were talking, busyness was happening.

‘No one would believe yer,’ said Jackrum, at last.

‘Who would I want to tell?’ said Polly. ‘And you’re right. No one would
believe me. I’d believe _you_, though.’

Jackrum stared into his fresh mug of beer, as if trying to see the
future in the foam. He seemed to reach a decision, pulled the gold chain
out of his noisome vest, unfastened the locket, and gently snapped it
open.

‘There you go,’ he said, passing it across. ‘Much good may it do you.’

There was a miniature painting in each side of the locket: a dark-haired
girl, and a blond young man in the uniform of the Ins-and-Outs.

‘Good one of you,’ said Polly.

‘Pull the other one, it’s got bells on,’ said Jackrum.

‘No, honestly,’ said Polly. ‘I look at the picture, and look at you
. . . I can see that face in her face. Paler, of course. Not so . . .
full. And who was the boy?’

‘William, his name was,’ said Jackrum.

‘Your sweetheart?’

‘Yes.’

‘And you followed him into the army . . .’

‘Oh, yeah. Same old story. I was a big strong girl, and . . . well, you
can see the picture. The artist did his best, but I was never an oil
painting. Barely a water-colour, really. Where I came from, what a man
looked for in a future wife was someone who could lift a pig under each
arm. And a couple of days later I _was_ lifting a pig under each arm,
helping my dad, and one of my clogs came off in the muck and the ol’ man
was yelling at me and I thought: the hell with this, Willie never
yelled. Got hold of some men’s clothes, never you mind how, cut my hair
right off, kissed the Duchess, and was a Chosen Man within three
months.’

‘What’s that?’

‘It’s what we used to call a corporal,’ said Jackrum. ‘Chosen Man. Yeah,
I smiled about that, too. And I was on my way. The army’s a piece of
piss compared to running a pig farm and looking after three lazy
brothers.’

‘How long ago was that, sarge?’

‘Couldn’t say, really. I swear I don’t know how old I am, and that’s the
truth,’ said Jackrum. ‘Lied about my age so often I ended up believing
me.’ She began, very carefully, to transfer the chewing tobacco into the
new bag.

‘And your young man?’ said Polly quietly.

‘Oh, we had great times, great times,’ said Jackrum, stopping for a
moment to stare at nothing. ‘He never got promoted on account of his
stutter, but I had a good shouty voice and officers like that. But
Willie never minded, not even when I made it to sergeant. And then he
got killed at Sepple, right next to me.’

‘I’m sorry.’

‘You don’t have to be, you didn’t kill him,’ said Jackrum evenly. ‘But I
stepped over his body and skewered the bugger that did. Wasn’t his
fault. Wasn’t my fault. We were soldiers. And then a few months later I
had a bit of a surprise, and he was called William, too, just like his
father. Good job I had a bit of leave, eh? Me gran raised him for me,
put him to a trade as an armourer over in Scritz. Good trade, that. No
one kills a good armourer. They tell me he looks just like his dad. A
captain I met once had bought a bloody good sword off him. Showed it to
me, not knowin’ the hist’ry, o’ course. _Damn_ good sword. It had
scrollwork on the hilt and everything, very classy. He’s married with
four kids now, I heard. Got a carriage and pair, servants, big house
. . . yeah, I see you’re paying attention . . .’

‘Wazzer – well, Wazzer and the Duchess said—’

‘Yeah, yeah, they talked about Scritz, and a sword,’ said Jackrum.
‘That’s when I knew it wasn’t just me watchin’ over you lads. I knew
you’d survive. The old girl needed you.’

‘So you’ve got to go there, sarge.’

‘Got to? Who says? I’ve served the old girl the whole of my life, and
she’s got no call on me now. I’m my own man, always have been.’

‘Are you, sarge?’ said Polly.

‘Are you crying, Perks?’

‘Well . . . it’s a bit sad, sarge.’

‘Oh, I dare say I sobbed a bit too, once in a while,’ said Jackrum,
still tucking the tobacco into the new pouch. ‘But when all’s said and
done, I’ve had a good life. Saw the cavalry break at the Battle of
Slomp. I was part of the Thin Red Line that turned aside the Heavy
Brigade at Sheep’s Drift, I saved the Imperial flag from four real
bastards at Raladan, and I’ve been to a lot of foreign countries and met
some very interesting people, who I mostly subsequently killed before
they could do me over good and proper. Lost a lover, still got a son
. . . there’s many a woman who’s faced worse, believe me.’

‘And . . . you spotted other girls . . .’

‘Hah! Became a kind of hobby, really. Most of ’em were frightened little
things, running away from god knows what. They got found out soon
enough. And there were plenty like Shufti, chasin’ their lad. But there
were a few who had what I call the _twinkle_. A bit of fire, maybe. They
just needed pointing in the right direction. I gave them a leg up, you
might say. A sergeant’s a powerful man, sometimes. A word here, a nod
there, sometimes even doctorin’ some paperwork, a whisper in the dark—’

‘—a pair of socks,’ said Polly.

‘Yeah, that sort of thing,’ said Jackrum, grinning. ‘Always a big
concern to them, the whole latrine business. Least of your worries, I
used to say. In peace no one cares, in battle everyone takes a piss the
same way, and damn quickly, too. Oh, I helped ’em. I was their whatsit,
their _eminence grease_, and grease it was, too, slidin’ them to the
top. Jackrum’s Little Lads, I called ’em.’

‘And they never suspected?’

‘What, suspect Jolly Jack Jackrum, so full of rum and vinegar?’ said
Jackrum, the old evil grin coming back. ‘Jack Jackrum, who could stop a
bar fight by belchin’? No, sir! I dare say some of ’em suspected
_something_, maybe, I dare say they worked out that there was something
going on somewhere, but I was just the big fat sergeant who knew
everyone and everything and drank everything, too.’

Polly dabbed at her eyes. ‘What are you going to do now, then, if you
don’t go to Scritz?’

‘Oh, I’ve got a bit put by,’ said Jackrum. ‘More than a bit, in point of
actual fact. Pillage, plunder, loot . . . it all adds up, whatever you
call it. I didn’t piss it all up against a wall like the other lads,
right? I expect I can remember most of the bleedin’ places I buried it.
Always thought I might open an inn, or maybe a knocking shop . . . oh, a
proper high class place, you don’t have to look at me like that, nothin’
like that stinking tent. No, I’m talkin’ about one with a chef and
chandeliers and a lot of red velvet, very exclusive. I’d get some nobby
lady to front it and I’d be the bouncer and run the bar. Here’s a tip,
lad, for your future career, and it’s one some of the other Little Lads
learned for ’emselves: sometimes it’ll help if you visits one of them
naughty places, otherwise the men’ll wonder about you. I always used to
take a book to read and advise the young lady to get some sleep, ’cos
they does a tough job.’

Polly let that pass, but said: ‘You don’t want to go back and see your
grandchildren?’

‘Wouldn’t wish meself on him, lad,’ said Jackrum firmly. ‘Wouldn’t dare.
My boy’s a well-respected man in the town! What’ve I got to offer? He’ll
not want some fat ol’ biddy banging on his back door and gobbing baccy
juice all over the place and telling him she’s his mother!’

Polly looked at the fire for a moment, and felt the idea creep into her
mind. ‘What about a distinguished sergeant major, shiny with braid,
loaded with medals, arriving at the front door in a grand coach and
telling him he’s his father?’ she said.

Jackrum stared.

‘Tides of war, and all that,’ Polly went on, mind suddenly racing.
‘Young love. Duty calls. Families scattered. Hopeless searching. Decades
pass. Fond memories. Then . . . oh, an overheard conversation in a bar,
yeah, that’d work. Hope springs. A new search. Greasing palms. The
recollections of old women. At last, an address—’

‘What’re you _saying_, Perks?’

‘You’re a _liar_, sarge,’ said Polly. ‘Best I’ve ever heard. One last
lie pays for all! Why not? You could show him the locket. You could tell
him about the girl you left behind you . . .’

Jackrum looked away, but said: ‘You’re a shining bastard of a thinker,
Perks. And where would I get a grand coach, anyway?’

‘Oh, _sarge_! Today? There are . . . _men_ in high places who’ll give
you anything you ask for, right now. You know that. Especially if it
means they’d see the back of you. You never put the bite on them for
anything much. If I was you, sarge, I’d cash in a few favours while you
can. That’s the Ins-and-Outs, sarge. Take the cheese while it’s there,
’cos kissin’ don’t last.’

Jackrum took a deep, long breath. ‘I’ll think about it, Perks. Now you
push off, all right?’

Polly stood up. ‘Think hard, sarge, eh? Like you said, anyone who’s got
anyone left is ahead of the game right now. Four grandchildren? _I’d_ be
a proud kid if I had a grandad who could spit tobacco juice far enough
to hit a fly on the opposite wall.’

‘I’m warning you, Perks.’

‘It was just a thought, sarge.’

‘Yeah . . . right,’ Jackrum growled.

‘Thanks for getting us through it, sarge.’

Jackrum didn’t turn round.

‘I’ll be going, then, sarge.’

‘Perks!’ said Jackrum, as she reached the door. Polly stepped back into
the room.

‘Yes, sarge?’

‘I . . . expected better of ’em, really. I thought they’d be better at
it than men. Trouble was, they were better than men at being like men.
They do say the army can make a man of you, eh? So . . . whatever it is
you are going to do next, do it as you. Good or bad, do it as you. Too
many lies and there’s no truth to go back to.’

‘Will do, sarge.’

‘That’s an order, Perks. Oh . . . and Perks?’

‘Yes, sarge?’

‘Thanks, Perks.’

Polly paused when she got to the door. Jackrum had turned her chair to
the fire, and had settled back. Around him, the kitchen worked.

Six months passed. The world wasn’t perfect, but it was still turning.

Polly had kept the newspaper articles. They weren’t accurate, not in the
detail, because the writer told . . . stories, not what was actually
happening. They were like paintings, when _you_ had been there and had
seen the real thing. But it was true about the march on the castle, with
Wazzer on a white horse in front, carrying the flag. And it was true
about people coming out of their houses and joining the march, so that
what arrived at the gates was not an army but a sort of disciplined mob,
shouting and cheering. And it was true that the guards had taken one
look at it and had seriously reconsidered their future, and that the
gates had swung open even before the horse had clattered on to the
drawbridge. There was no fighting, no fighting at all. The shoe had
dropped. The country had breathed out.

Polly didn’t think it was true that the painting of the Duchess, alone
on its easel in the big, empty throne room, had smiled when Wazzer
walked towards it. Polly had been there and didn’t see it happen, but
lots of people swore it had, and you might end up wondering what the
truth really was, or whether there were lots of different kinds of
truth.

Anyway, it had worked. And then . . .

. . . they went home. A lot of soldiers did, under the fragile truce.
The first snows were already falling and, if people had wanted a war,
then the winter had given them one. It came with lances of ice and
arrows of hunger, it filled the passes with snow, it made the world as
distant as the moon . . .

That was when the old dwarf mines had opened up, and pony after pony
emerged. It had always been said there were dwarf tunnels everywhere,
and not just tunnels; secret canals under the mountains, docks, flights
of locks that could lift a barge a mile high in busy darkness, far below
the gales on the mountain tops.

They brought, indeed, cabbage and potatoes and roots and apples and
barrels of fat, things that _kept_. And winter was defeated, and the
snowmelt roared down the valleys, and the Kneck scrawled its random
wiggles across the flat silt of the valley.

They’d gone home, and Polly wondered if they’d ever really been away.
Were we soldiers? she wondered. They’d been cheered on the road to
PrinceMarmadukePiotreAlbertHans JosephBernhardtWilhelmsberg, and had
been much better treated than their rank deserved, and even had a
special uniform designed for them. But the vision of Gummy Abbens kept
rising in her mind . . .

We weren’t soldiers, she decided. We were girls in uniform. We were like
a lucky charm. We _were_ mascots. We weren’t real, we were always a
symbol of something. We’d done very well, for women. And we were
temporary.

Tonker and Lofty were never going to be dragged back to the school now,
and they’d gone their own way. Wazzer had joined the general’s
household, and had a room of her own, and quietness, and made herself
useful and was never beaten. She’d written Polly a letter, in tiny spiky
handwriting. She seemed happy; a world without beatings was heaven. Jade
and her beau had wandered off to do something more interesting, as
trolls very sensibly did. Shufti . . . had been on a timetable of her
own. Maladicta had disappeared. And Igorina had set up by herself in the
capital, dealing with women’s problems, or at least those women’s
problems that weren’t men. And senior officers had given them medals,
and watched them go with fixed, faint smiles. Kisses don’t last.

And, now, it wasn’t that good things were happening, it was just that
bad things had stopped. The old women still grumbled, but they were left
to grumble. No one had any directions, no one had a map, no one was
quite certain who was in charge. There were arguments and debates on
every street corner. It was frightening and exhilarating. Every day was
an exploration. Polly had worn a pair of Paul’s old trousers to clean
the floor of the big bar, and had got barely a ‘hurrumph’ from anyone.
Oh, and the Girls’ Working School had burned down, and on the same day
two slim masked figures had robbed a bank. Polly had grinned when she
heard that. Shufti had moved into The Duchess. Her baby was called Jack.
Paul doted on it. And now . . .

Someone had been drawing in the gents’ privy again. Polly couldn’t wash
it off, so she contented herself with correcting the anatomy. Then she
swooshed the place clean – at least, clean by pub urinal standards –
with a couple of buckets and ticked off the chore, just as she did every
morning. When she arrived back in the bar there were a group of worried
men there, talking to her father. They looked mildly frightened when she
strode in.

‘What’s happening?’ she said.

Her father nodded to Gummy Abbens, and everyone stepped back a little.
What with the spittle and the bad breath, you never wanted a
conversation with Gummy to be particularly intimate.

‘The swede-eatersh is at it again!’ he said. ‘They’re gonna invade ’cos
the Prince saysh we belong to him now!’

‘It’s all down to him being the Duchess’s distant cousin,’ said Polly’s
father.

‘But I heard it still wasn’t settled!’ said Polly. ‘Anyway, there’s
still a truce!’

‘Sheems like he’s shettling it,’ said Gummy.

The rest of the day passed at an accelerated pace. There were groups of
people talking urgently in the streets, and a crowd around the gates to
the town hall. Every so often a clerk would come out and nail another
communiqué on the gates; the crowd would close over it like a hand, open
again like a flower. Polly elbowed her way to the front, ignoring the
mutterings around her, and scanned the sheets.

The same old stuff. They were recruiting again. The same old words. The
same old croakings of long dead soldiers, inviting the living to join
them. General Froc might be female, but he was also, as Blouse would
have said, ‘a bit of an old woman’. Either that or the heaviness of
those epaulettes had weighed her down.

Kissing don’t last. Oh, the Duchess had come alive before them and
turned the world upside down for a space and maybe they had all decided
to be better people, and out of certain oblivion had come a space to
breathe.

But then . . . had it really happened? Even Polly sometimes wondered,
and she _had_ been there. Was it just a voice in their heads, some kind
of hallucination? Weren’t soldiers in desperate straits famous for
seeing visions of gods and angels? And somewhere in the course of the
long winter the miracle had faded, and people had said ‘yes, but we’ve
got to be practical’.

All we were given was a chance, thought Polly. No miracle, no rescue, no
magic. Just a chance.

She walked back to the inn, her mind buzzing. When she got there, a
package was waiting. It was quite long, and heavy.

‘It came all the way from Scritz on the cart,’ said Shufti excitedly.
She’d been working in the kitchen. It had become, now, _her_ kitchen. ‘I
wonder what it can be?’ she said pointedly.

Polly levered the lid off the rough wooden crate, and found that it was
full of straw with an envelope lying on top of it. She opened it.

Inside was an iconograph. It looked expensively done, a stiff family
group with curtains and a potted palm in the background to give
everything a bit of style. On the left was a middle-aged man looking
proud; on the right was a woman of about the same age, looking rather
puzzled but nevertheless pleased because her husband was happy; and here
and there, staring at the viewer with variations of smile and squint,
and expressions extending from interest to a sudden recollection that
they should have gone to the toilet before posing, were children ranging
from tall and gangly to small and smugly sweet.

And sitting on a chair in the middle, the focus of it all, was
Sergeant-major Jackrum, shining like the sun.

Polly stared, and then turned the picture over. On the back was written,
in big black letters: ‘SM Jackrum’s Last Stand!’ and, underneath, ‘Don’t
need these.’

She smiled, and pulled aside the straw. In the middle of the box,
wrapped in cloth, were a couple of cutlasses.

‘Is that old Jackrum?’ said Shufti, picking up the picture.

‘Yes. He’s found his son,’ said Polly, unwinding a blade. Shufti
shuddered when she saw it.

‘Evil things,’ she said.

‘Things, anyway,’ said Polly. She laid both the cutlasses on the table,
and was about to lift the box out of the way when she saw something
small in the straw at the bottom. It was oblong, and wrapped in thin
leather.

It was a notebook, with a cheap binding and musty yellowing pages.

‘What’s that?’ said Shufti.

‘I think . . . yes, it’s his address book,’ said Polly, flicking through
the pages.

This is it, she thought. It’s all here. Generals and majors and
captains, oh my. There must be . . . hundreds. Maybe a thousand! Names,
_real_ names, promotions, dates . . . everything . . .

She pulled out a white pasteboard oblong that had been inserted like a
bookmark. It showed a rather florid coat of arms and bore the printed
legend:

Someone had crossed out the ‘p’ in ‘frep’ and pencilled in an ‘e’ above
it.

It was a sudden strange fancy . . .

How many ways can you fight a war? Polly wondered. We have the clacks
now. I know a man who writes things down. The world turns. Plucky little
countries seeking self-determination . . . could be useful to big
countries with plans of their own.

Time to grab the cheese.

Polly’s expression as she stared at the wall would have frightened a
number of important people. They would have been even more concerned at
the fact that she spent the next several hours writing things down,
because it occurred to Polly that General Froc had not got where she was
today by being stupid and therefore she could profit from following her
example. She copied out the entire notebook, and sealed it in an old jam
jar which she hid in the roof of the stables. She wrote a few letters.
And she got her uniform out of the wardrobe and inspected it critically.

The uniforms that had been made for them had a special, additional
quality that could only be called . . . girlie. They had more braid,
they were better tailored, and they had a long skirt with a bum roll
rather than trousers. The shakos had plumes, too. _Her_ tunic had a
sergeant’s stripes. It had been a _joke_. A sergeant of women. The world
had been turned upside down, after all.

They’d been mascots, good-luck charms . . . And, perhaps, on the march
to PrinceMarmadukePiotreAlbertHansJosephBernhardt Wilhelmsberg a joke
was what everyone needed. But, maybe, when the world turns upside down,
you can turn a joke upside down too. Thank you, Gummy, even though you
didn’t know what it was you were teaching me. When they’re laughing at
you, their guard is down. When their guard is down, you can kick them in
the fracas.

She examined herself in the mirror. Her hair, now, was just long enough
to be a nuisance without being long enough to be attractive, so she
brushed it and left it at that. She put the uniform on, but with the
skirt over her trousers, and tried to put aside the nagging feeling that
she was dressing up as a woman.

There. She looked completely harmless. She looked slightly less harmless
with both cutlasses and one of the horsebows on her back, especially if
you knew that the inn’s dartboards now had deep holes in the bullseyes
from all the practising.

She crept along the hall to the window that overlooked the inn yard.
Paul was up a ladder, repainting the sign. Her father was steadying the
ladder and calling out instructions in his normal way, which was to call
out the instruction just a second or two after you’d already started
doing it. And Shufti, although Polly was the only one in The Duchess who
still called her that and knew why, was watching them, holding Jack. It
made a lovely picture. For a moment, she wished she had a locket.

The Duchess was smaller than she’d thought. But if you had to protect it
by standing in the doorway with a sword, you were too late. Caring for
small things had to start with caring for big things, and maybe the
world wasn’t big enough.

The note she left on her dressing table read: ‘Shufti, I hope you and
Jack are happy here. Paul, you look after her. Dad, I’ve never taken any
wages, but I need a horse. I’ll try to have it sent back. I love you
all. If I don’t come back, burn this letter and look in the roof of the
stables.’

She dropped out of the window, saddled up a horse in the stables, and
let herself out of the back gate. She didn’t mount up until she was out
of earshot, and then rode down to the river.

Spring was pouring through the country. Sap was rising. In the woods, a
ton of timber was growing every minute. Everywhere, birds were singing.

There was a guard on the ferry. He eyed her nervously as she led the
horse aboard, and then grinned. ‘’Morning, miss!’ he said cheerfully.

Oh, well . . . time to start. Polly marched in front of the puzzled man.

‘Are you trying to be _smart_?’ she demanded, inches from his face.

‘No, miss—’

‘That’s sergeant, mister!’ said Polly. ‘Let’s try _again_, shall we? I
said, are you trying to be smart?’

‘No, sergeant!’

Polly leaned until her nose was an inch from his. ‘_Why not?_’

The grin faded. This was not a soldier on the fast track to promotion.
‘Huh?’ he managed.

‘If you are not trying to be smart, mister, you’re happy to be stupid!’
shouted Polly. ‘And I’m up to here with stupid, understand?’

‘Yeah, but—’

‘But _what_, soldier?’

‘Yeah, but . . . well . . . but . . . nothing, sergeant,’ said the
soldier.

‘That’s good.’ Polly nodded at the ferrymen. ‘Time to go?’ she
suggested, but in the tones of an order.

‘Couple of people just coming down the road, sergeant,’ said one of
them, a faster man with an uptake.

They waited. There were, in fact, three people. One of them was
Maladicta, in full uniform.

Polly said nothing until the ferry was out in midstream. The vampire
gave her the kind of smile only a vampire can give. It would have been
sheepish, if sheep had different teeth.

‘Thought I’d try again,’ she said.

‘We’ll find Blouse,’ said Polly.

‘He’s a major now,’ said Maladicta. ‘And happy as a flea because they’ve
named a kind of fingerless glove after him, I heard. What do we want him
for?’

‘He knows about the clacks. He knows about other ways war can be fought.
And I know . . . people,’ said Polly.

‘Ah. Do you mean the “Upon my oath, I am not a lying man, but I know
people” kind of people?’

‘Those were the kind of people I had in mind, yes.’ The river slapped
against the side of the ferry.

‘Good,’ said Maladicta.

‘I don’t know where it’s going to lead, though,’ said Polly.

‘Ah. Even better.’

At which point, Polly decided that she knew enough of the truth to be
going on with. The enemy wasn’t men, or women, or the old, or even the
dead. It was just bleedin’ stupid people, who came in all varieties. And
no one had the right to be stupid.

She looked at the other two passengers who’d sidled aboard. They were
country lads in ragged, ill-fitting clothes, keeping away from her and
staring intently at the deck. But one glance was enough. The world
turned upside down, and history repeated. For some reason, that suddenly
made her feel very happy.

‘Going to join up, lads?’ she said, cheerily.

There was some mumbling on the theme of ‘yes’.

‘Good. Then stand up straight,’ said Polly. ‘Let’s have a look at you.
Chins up. Ah. Well done. Shame you didn’t practise walking in trousers,
and I notice you didn’t bring an extra pair of socks.’

They stared, mouths open.

‘What are your names?’ said Polly. ‘Your _real_ names, please?’

‘Er . . . Rosemary,’ one of them began.

‘I’m Mary,’ said the other. ‘I heard girls were joining, but everyone
laughed, so I thought I’d better pretend to—’

‘Oh, you can join as men if you want,’ said Polly. ‘We need a few good
men.’

The girls looked at one another.

‘You get better swear words,’ said Polly. ‘And the trousers are useful.
But it’s your choice.’

‘A choice?’ said Rosemary.

‘Certainly,’ said Polly. She put a hand on a shoulder of each girl,
winked at Maladicta and added: ‘You are my little lads – or not, as the
case may be – and _I_ will look after . . . _you_.’

And the new day was a great big fish.

 

 

THE END

 

¹ Trolls might not be quick thinkers but they don’t forget in a hurry,
either.

² And allowing for the fact that all pigeons who know how birds of prey
catch are dead, and therefore capable of slightly less thought than a
living pigeon.

³ A woman always has half an onion left over, no matter what the size of
the onion, the dish or the woman.

⁴ And even then it was the kind of home that has a burned-out vehicle on
the lawn.

⁵ Lieutenant Blouse read only the more technical history books.

⁶ Actually a tree is not, technically, required, but seems to be
insisted upon for reasons of style.

⁷ And failed to hit anything, especially a duck. This is so unusual in
situations like this that it should be reported under new humour
regulations. If it had hit a duck, which quacked and then landed on
somebody’s head, this would of course have been very droll and would
certainly have been reported. Instead, it drifted in the breeze a little
and landed in an oak tree some thirty feet away, where it missed a
squirrel.

⁸ It’s hard to be an ornithologist and walk through a wood when all
around you the world is shouting: ‘Bugger off, this is my bush! Aargh,
the nest thief! Have sex with me, I can make my chest big and red!’

⁹ It is an established fact that, despite everything society can do,
girls of seven are magnetically attracted to the colour pink.

¹⁰ Every long-established kitchen has one of these, and no one ever
remembers why. It is generally for something that no one does any more
and, even when it was done, it wasn’t done with any real enthusiasm,
such as celery basting, walnut shredding or, in the worst case, edible
dormouse stuffing.
