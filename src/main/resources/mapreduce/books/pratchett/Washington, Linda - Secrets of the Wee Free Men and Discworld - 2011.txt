INTRODUCTION

And Now for Something Completely Different …

 

 

You’d have to be a very strange person to get all of the jokes. But I
hope you’ll get between 80 and 90 percent, and the ones you don’t get,
you won’t actually notice are there.¹

—Terry Pratchett

Novelist Patrick Rothfuss, when asked “Who do you read?”, replied,
“Terry Pratchett. He doesn’t get enough credit for the superbly
believable world he’s created. It’s internally consistent, well
constructed, and his characters behave realistically.”² Whether you
agree with those words or wonder whether Pratchett would agree, one
thing is for certain: The influence of Terry Pratchett in the literary
world is obvious. If you don’t believe that, check out the science
fiction/fantasy section at your local bookstore or library.

For a long time, Terry Pratchett was pretty lonely at the very top of
the British literary food chain—at least until the arrival of a
certain author by the name of J. K. Rowling. But with well over fifty
million books sold (as of February 2007, according to Wikipedia, the
site that seems to know all), Pratchett is still an international
phenomenon and a consistent best seller. His brainchild, as if you
didn’t know, is the Discworld series, thirty-six books (as of the
writing of this book and excluding Where’s My Cow? and the Nanny Ogg
Cookbook) strong, and still going like the Energizer bunny. Although
this series began as parodies of other works such as Ring-world,
Macbeth, and The Arabian Nights, it defies all pigeonholes. Is it
science fiction? Fantasy? Mystery? Political intrigue? Romance? (Uh, no
to the latter.) It is, to use a phrase often heard on Monty Python,
something completely different.

If you’ve been tempted, like many others, to avoid or underestimate the
Discworld series because of its parodies and humor, maybe after reading
this, you’ll reconsider.

READERS OF THE DISCWORLD BOOKS

Okay, so one of the authors of this book (Carrie) is keenly aware that
her parents were born the same year as Terry Pratchett was and that she
was born the same year as Pratchett’s daughter, Rhianna, which in some
way creates a connection with the author in a strange, paternal way.
(The other author, Linda, has absolutely no comment to make about
birthdays.) She is also aware that her parents would never open a Terry
Pratchett book, especially not a Discworld book.

So who does read Terry Pratchett? His loyal followers range from nuns
(unlike the satanic nuns in Good Omens) to the new generation digging
into The Wee Free Men and Wintersmith. Pratchett’s audience is hard to
fit into a box. Young, somewhat old, Trekkers, Lord of the Rings buffs,
Harry Potter fans, our strange friend who loves The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy movie that made me (Carrie) fall asleep, hobbits, maybe a
teacher or two, and fools. We were even lucky enough to find a Web site
giving Christians advice
on which Pratchett books were good and which were dangerous.³ Honestly,
it is difficult to really pinpoint what makes a person willing to read
Pratchett. Usually the result is to get hooked on the series. Then, of
course, the individual tries to read the books quicker than Pratchett
writes them (a quite difficult task)!

Discworld is so well received, or at least read, by so many people,
because Pratchett is able to make us laugh about everything. He may
offend us in one paragraph and then cause us to have a laughing fit in
the next, which washes away the initial offense. It is typical for the
laughing fit to delay one’s reading for many minutes and can be the
cause of interesting looks from one’s spouse.⁴ If you’re anything like
us, it will be almost impossible to explain to onlookers what was so
funny that you fell off the couch and rolled around in hysterics. I have
found it is best to not try and explain, especially if it was due to
reading Nanny Ogg’s Cookbook. Oh, and certainly do not try to explain
Unseen University’s orangutan Librarian.

Someone (perhaps you?) is obviously buying millions of copies of
Pratchett’s books. If it is not you, we are not quite sure why you
picked up this book unless you are Linda’s dad or my grandma.

TERRY PRATCHETT IN BRIEF

Terence David John Pratchett was born in 1948⁵ and, according to
himself, he is still alive.⁶ Therefore, if he were an American, he would
be considered a baby boomer, which entitles him to our attention. He
began his writing career at the age of thirteen, when his short story
“The Hades Business” was published in the school magazine; it was sold
to a commercially published magazine when he was fifteen. After leaving
school in 1965, he became a journalist with the Bucks Free Press and
later with the Western Daily Press and The Bath Chronicle.

While between stints at the Bucks Free Press, he published his first
novel, The Carpet People (1971). He began writing it at the age of
seventeen. This was followed by The Dark Side of the Sun (1976).

His novel Strata (1981) is considered to be the forerunner of Discworld.
While he was working as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity
Generating Board, he published his first Discworld book, The Color of
Magic (1983).

We could tell you that he’s written well over fifty books, including
young adult novels like The Bromeliad Trilogy (Truckers, Diggers, and
Wings), the Johnny Maxwell books (Only You Can Save Mankind, Johnny and
the Dead, and Johnny and the Bomb), and children’s books such as The
Unadulterated Cat and Where’s My Cow? But you probably already knew
that.

WHY WRITE A BOOK ON DISCWORLD?

Call us crazy, but we really like Pratchett’s books and are dying to
tell you why—hence this book. Collectively, we have read and studied all
of Pratchett’s Discworld books—except for Making Money (October 2007).
Our deadline didn’t coincide with that one. It is very difficult to read
faster than Pratchett writes. By the time our book is published, the
prolific writer will probably have at least two more books out. And by
the time you find time to read this book, many more titles in the
Discworld series will be lining the local bookstores and landing their
way on Top Ten readers’ lists.

Does writing a book on Discworld make us experts on Pratchett? Hardly.
We aren’t privy to deep, dark wisdom from Terry and his
family, nor did we snoop through his garbage like crazed paparazzi
(though we wanted to). Although this book doesn’t contain every person,
every street, every place, or every event, it does explore some of the
mythological, scientific, and pop culture building blocks that correlate
with Discworld. If you know and love this series, we hope we inspire you
to look at it in a fresh way. If you’ve never read any of the Discworld
books, maybe you’ll take a chance. Go on. We dare you … right after you
read this book.

Well, let’s get on with it, shall we?

 

Please Note: In the footnotes throughout, books not attributed to an
author were written by Terry Pratchett.

Part One

Pratchett, Parodies, and Plots: The Literary Roots of Discworld

Blueprint for a World

THE ARCHITECT AT WORK

Sometimes old buildings inspire us, sometimes the opposite is true. We
look at an old building and ask ourselves, “What on earth were those
people thinking of?”

—Witold Rybczynski, The Look of Architecture⁷

If you were on an architectural tour of, say, Saint Peter’s Square in
Rome, maybe your tour guide would say something like, “This is a true
example of Italian baroque—one of Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini’s finest” in
the lilting tone that many tour guides have. Then, while telling you how
the architect was inspired to design such a masterpiece, he or she might
slip in a genteel pun, one certain to be a cut above the
if-it-ain’t-baroque-don’t-fix-it variety that you might hear and chuckle
at out of pity back home.

We brought that up for two reasons: (1) A fantasy writer like Terry
Pratchett is an architect of sorts, but on a much grander scale than an
Italian baroque master like Bernini or his rival, Francesco Borromini.
After all, he had a whole world to design. Bernini and Borromini only
had to influence Italy and several generations of would-be architects.
(2) In this chapter, we’re about to take you on an architectural tour of
the Discworld, but one without the lilting tone or even remarks (at
least not many remarks) about the actual architecture, such as Unseen
University. (You would’ve bought The Discworld Mapp or The Streets of
Ankh-Morpork for that, wouldn’t you?) Instead, we’ll discuss words—the
building blocks of Discworld. Like the furniture in the office of
Ladislav Pelc, the Professor of Morbid Bibliomancy in Going Postal,
Discworld is a world designed out of books. It is a veritable library of
literary allusions. By the end of the tour, you might feel like A.
Clarence Shandon in Silverlock by John Myers Myers—as if you’ve walked
through literary history.

And since we’re discussing Discworld, where characters named Flatulus
(the god of winds, of course) abide, we’ll throw in puns for free. Let’s
get write to it, shall we? (Feel free to ask questions while on the
tour. We’ll do our best to answer them. No question is considered dumb.)

Since this is not a short chapter, maybe you should send out for pizza.
We like pepperoni … .

DISCLAIMER (or in honor of Discworld, Disc-Claimer):

This tour is by no means exhaustive. You might easily think of some
aspects or allusions not noted here. We won’t hold that against you.

Like any good architect’s, Pratchett’s work should be judged by whether
it fulfills the three purposes of good architecture, namely: (1) to
shelter people; (2) to be durable against the elements and
gravity; (3) to be beautiful or delightful.⁸ Judging by the millions of
fans, shelves of books written over decades, awards, and several
Discworld conventions (the first North American one coming in 2009!), we
would venture to say that Discworld fulfilled all three.

If you read Strata, you caught the gleam of Discworld in Pratchett’s
eye. But if you read Ringworld by Larry Niven, you caught the
inspiration for that gleam. After all, Strata is considered a parody of
Ringworld, Niven’s 1970 sci-fi classic detailing the discovery of a
600-million-mile, ring-shaped world by an intrepid, eclectic collection
of explorers. (In comparison, the Disc is only 10,000 miles wide.)⁹

But the world beginning with The Color of Magic didn’t just spring into
being in 1983, or two years previous to that when Strata appeared, or
even when Ringworld was read. If you look even further back, you’ll find
other elements that went into the blueprint of Discworld. There’s a
little bit of this and that in Pratchett’s design.

INSPIRATION FROM THE PAST

Throughout our history we have clung to elements of our past as carriers
of our culture … . Where we can, we need to preserve its triumphs and
occasionally its follies, the best and even sometimes the mundane
examples of how our society lived, worked, worshiped, and played.

—John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill¹⁰

An architect can look at an old building, with its crenellations or
cornices, its Gothic or baroque style, and find inspiration to design
something new to wow a twenty-first-century population. Or he or she,
for the love of a particular time period (say, the 1920s), might design
a building to revive a style of the past.

Terry Pratchett looked at several old myths and was inspired to create
Discworld.

Greek, Roman, and Norse Mythology: Pratchett Mines the Myths

Pick any of the Discworld books at random and you’ll soon know that
Terry Pratchett is very familiar with Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic
mythology. Go on. We dare you. First, look at the Disc itself. In the
world of Norse mythology, Earth is a flat disc in the branches of a tree
called Yggdrasil. (Not a name you’d stick on a baby these days.) In
Pratchett’s world, the earth is a flat disc mounted on the backs of four
elephants standing on a humongous turtle traveling through the
multiverse (rather than the universe). That turtle is based on a myth he
read as a child. More on that myth later.

Second, check out the population. As you remember from high school or
even middle school if you went to a fancy one, in Greek and Roman
mythology, there are creatures like centaurs, fauns, satyrs, naiads,
dryads, nymphs. But intervening or interfering in their lives are
gods/goddesses such as Zeus, Hera, Minerva/Athena, Ares, and so on, who
live on Mount Olympus. (Yeah, yeah. Like in the old Xena: Warrior
Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journey shows.) In Norse mythology,
the gods/goddesses Odin, Thor, Eir, and so on live in Valhalla. Let’s
begin our population examination (it won’t hurt) with the Discworld
pantheon.

 

The Gods Must Be Crazy. In the pantheon of Discworld, there’s a smidgen
of Greek and Roman mythology, plus a smattering of Norse as well.
Instead of the two-eyed chief god Zeus (Jupiter in
Roman mythology); Thor, the Norse thunder god; or even Thor’s father,
Odin, the one-eyed chief of the Aesir gods in Norse mythology, Blind Io,
the thunder god, is the chief of the Discworld gods. Instead of Bacchus,
the Greek god of wine, there’s Bibulous, the god of wine and things on
sticks. Instead of Loki, the trickster god kicked out of Valhalla,
there’s Hoki the Jokester. Instead of Aphrodite/Venus, the goddess of
love, there’s Astoria (like the hotel). And who can forget Pratchett’s
Fedecks—the messenger of the gods? (“When it absolutely has to be there
overnight,” as a FedEx advertising slogan proclaimed.) He can give
Hermes, the messenger god (Mercury in Roman mythology), a run for his
money. And of course, Discworld has minor deities similar to those in
Greek and Roman mythology: Vulcan (the Greek Vulcan) and Hephaistos (the
Greek Hephaestus).

Pratchett includes unique gods and goddesses as well, like Anoia, the
minor goddess of things that stick in drawers (and also lost corkscrews
and things that roll under furniture), and Aniger, the goddess of
squashed animals. (She must work overtime.)

Although we said we wouldn’t talk about architecture, we can’t help
mentioning one place—Dunmanifestin, the place where the gods apparently
were done manifesting. In The Last Hero, Ghengiz Cohen (a.k.a. Cohen the
Barbarian with a bit of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian conqueror of the
thirteenth century) and his posse, the Silver Horde, argue with the
Valkyries who want to take them to the Halls of the Slain in
Dunmanifestin on Cori Celesti. Well, Dunmanifestin is referred to as
“the stuccoed Valhalla” in Guards! Guards!¹¹ (The Valkyries, the female
warriors who take the dead to Valhalla, come from Norse mythology.)

According to Fairies and How to Avoid Them by Miss Perspicacia Tick (a
book mentioned in Hat Full of Sky), the Nac Mac Feegles believe that
Earth is like Valhalla.

 

Other Stories (But the Gods Are in Them, Too). Not content to tweak just
the gods of Greek myths, Pratchett tweaks other people or their
situations to include in Discworld. For example, you know the story of
King Midas, right? An allusion to the greedy king’s story appears early
in Witches Abroad, which seems to be a veritable “glodmine” of
allusions. Instead of King Midas, there is Seriph Al-Ybi, whose curse by
a god with poor spelling causes everything he touches to turn to a dwarf
named Glod.

And how about the story of Daedalus and Icarus? It gets a send-up in
Jingo and The Last Hero. Leonard of Quirm, Pratchett’s answer to
Leonardo da Vinci (more on them in chapter 19), has a similar goal of
perfecting the art of flying, but not airline food.

And of course, there is the story of Prometheus, the Titan and creator
of man (according to the Greek myth) who dared to steal fire from the
gods and suffered for it by having his liver eaten by an eagle every
day. (But not with bacon or onions.) He’s Mazda in Discworld and his
theft is the inspiration for The Last Hero, where Ghengiz Cohen and the
Silver Horde try to return fire to the gods by blowing them up. (A weird
way of saying thanks. Flowers would’ve been better.)

At this point, we have to mention another place—the Underworld, or realm
of the dead. The Greeks and Romans had it in their mythology. This
kingdom is ruled by Hades and surrounded by rivers that include Acheron,
Styx, and Lethe. A three-headed dog named Cerberus guards this realm.

Discworld not only has an Underworld, it has an inferno similar to the
one described in The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. But we’re getting
ahead of ourselves. (See “The Devil Made Me Do It” later in the
chapter.) In Wintersmith, the Nac Mac Feegles and Roland de
Chumsfanleigh journey through the Underworld to wake up the Summer Lady
and meet an unnamed, overcharging ferryman. Pratchett cleverly reminds
us where they are by having one
of the Feegles shout, “We’re right oot in the Styx noo!”¹² The
three-headed dog, however, meets its end thanks to the loads of boggles
in the Underworld.

As the Feegles explain, a trip through the Underworld is traditional for
heroes, because a number of heroes in classical mythology journeyed
through it. We’re told of a myth of Ephebe—the rescue of Euniphon by
Orpheo,¹³ which is an allusion to two Greek myths: (1) The story of
Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus, the son of Apollo (the god of fine arts)
and Calliope (a muse), was a poet and musician known especially for
playing the lyre. (In Pratchett’s book, a lute and a lyre are
mentioned.) He sorrowed so much when his wife, Eurydice, died, that
Hades allowed her to return to Earth with him on one condition—that
Orpheus not look back until he returned above ground. (In Wintersmith,
Rob Anybody cautions Roland in a similar manner.) But in a move like
that of Lot’s wife in the Bible, Orpheus looked back and Eurydice
returned to the Underworld. (2) The story of Persephone, whose enforced
stay in the Underworld caused winter on earth. But in Discworld, the
rescue is all about the return of summer—hence the Summer Lady’s stay in
the Underworld.

As we read this journey, we couldn’t help thinking of Odysseus, whose
trip through the Underworld to seek the aid of Tiresias, a blind
prophet, is chronicled in The Odyssey by another architect of
worlds—Homer (but not Simpson).

Speaking of Homer (still not Simpson), both of his epics, The Iliad and
The Odyssey, and Virgil’s The Aeneid have a place in Discworld
mythology. In Eric, the Trojan Wars from The Iliad and The Aeneid are
the Tsortean Wars in which the Ephebians (the Greeks) fight the
Tsorteans (the Trojans), because of Elenor, the Helen of Troy of the
story. Lavaeolus, the Odysseus of the story, is trying to return home.

The Tsortean Wars are woven even tighter into the fabric of Discworld
mythology when Nanny Ogg refers to them (and an Achilles’s heel
situation) in Witches Abroad.

Lest we forget, Roland de Chumsfanleigh is an allusion to Roland, the
hero of Chanson de Roland (Song of Roland) the twelfth-century French
epic by Turoldus.

 

A Nod to the Norse Myths. Moving on to Norse mythology, some of its
population find equal opportunity in Discworld, namely elves, dwarfs (or
dwarves, as Tolkien popularized), trolls (the faithful Sergeant
Detritus), werewolves (of sorts), and Valkyries.

The large number of werewolves prowling around Uberwald owe their
fictional lives to the long history of werewolf stories, starting with
Loki’s wolf son, Fenrir—who was so fearsome that the other gods had to
bind him to prevent him from killing them—and continuing with “White
Wolf of the Harz Mountains,” an 1839 story by Frederick Marryat, and the
1941 Lon Chaney movie The Wolf Man. (More on werewolves in chapter 4.)

European Folklore and History

I Dream of Jenny with the Light Green Teeth. Although The Lord of the
Rings was meant to be a mythology of sorts for England, many folktales
already existed around the British Isles. Some of these folktales
derived from tales elsewhere in Europe and the world. Take, for example,
the tale of Jenny Green-Teeth, whom Pratchett mentions in The Wee Free
Men. Jenny, a hag of the river and a “Grade 1 Prohibitory Monster”¹⁴
according to Miss Tick (see chapter 6), was known to lure children to
their doom—a fate that nearly befalls Tiffany’s sticky brother,
Wentworth. She’s a sort of antiondine or undine—a water elemental of
folklore
based on Ondine, a water nymph in German myths, who fell in love with a
faithless human. (Reminds you of “Little Mermaid,” doesn’t it?) Whereas
water nymphs are said to be beautiful and helpful (if helping suits
their needs), Jenny’s the Ugly Betty of the water spirit world. She’s
not so much concerned about gaining a soul, which undines seek (if you
read Hans Christian Andersen’s “Little Mermaid,” you know that was the
goal). She just wants lunch, as other famous child-eating witches (Baba
Yaga, the witch of Russian folklore, or the witch in “Hansel and
Gretel”) could relate to.

 

Freaks and Geats, Plus Arthur—Warts and All. Pratchett admits to reading
Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic, as a boy. Beowulf, the
great Geat hero with amazing strength, had the gumption to fight the
monster Grendel with his bare hands. And who doesn’t know the story of
King Arthur, told in a cycle of medieval stories? Beowulf, supposedly
written by a monk, and the legend of King Arthur—realized by Sir Thomas
Malory (Le Morte d’Arthur, based on French and English tales) and T. H.
White in The Once and Future King and The Book of Merlyn—set the
standard for heroic tales.

Carrot Ironfoundersson, who was named after a guy with red hair who
worked on Pratchett’s house, has both the manner of a Beowulf-type hero
and the legacy of a King Arthur, even though he considers himself a
dwarf. Like King Arthur, formerly known as Wart in Once and Future King,
Carrot is an orphan who is probably the rightful king of the land. Both
have heirloom swords. Unlike Arthur, Carrot was raised by dwarfs and is
content to remain a simple watchman for now, rather than rule over
corrupt Ankh-Morpork.

In The Fifth Elephant, Carrot agrees to fight a werewolf with his bare
hands. Shades of the Beowulf-Grendel match perhaps? Only Pratchett
knows. But a direct allusion to the monsters in Beowulf occurs in
Guards! Guards! when one hero says to another, “Monsters
are getting more uppity, too. I heard where this guy, he killed this
monster in this lake, no problem, stuck its arm up over the door … . Its
mum come and complained.”¹⁵

An allusion to the King Arthur legend occurs in Wintersmith, when Roland
throws his sword into the river while in the Underworld. The sword is
caught in a manner similar to that of the Lady of the Lake in the King
Arthur stories, who caught the sword, Excalibur, when it was returned to
her—her stipulation upon granting Arthur the sword.

 

Historical Hijinks. Another building block of Discworld involves
Alexandre Dumas, a nineteenth-century French writer you probably read in
high school, who used the drama of seventeenth-century France to tell
his musketeer stories. In The Truth, an allusion to The Man in the Iron
Mask is made when Lord Havelock Vetinari is asked about the fate of his
doppelgänger, an unfortunate man named Charlie. Is he “in a deep cell,
and made … [to] wear a mask all the time, and have all his meals brought
by a deaf and dumb jailer?”¹⁶ Philippe, the unfortunate mask-wearing
prisoner of Man in the Iron Mask, was taken away from the Bastille in a
carriage manned by a “deaf and dumb” postilion arranged by ex-musketeer
Aramis.

Folklore of the East

If any one should be asked … what is it that solidity and extension
adhere in, he would not be in a much better case than the Indian before
mentioned who, saying that the world was supported by a great elephant,
was asked what the elephant rested on; to which his answer was- a great
tortoise: but being
again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise,
replied- something, he knew not what.

—John Locke, British philosopher in chapter XXIII of An Essay Concerning
Human Understanding, written in 1690,¹⁷ a time when everyone talked like
this.

Perhaps when you’re eating aloo gobi or watching a Tony Jaa film (The
Protector!) you don’t think about myths from such countries as Thailand,
China, or India. (Maybe you will next time.) But Pratchett folds some of
the myths of the East into his cultural stew.

 

Terrifying Tortoises and Powerful Pachyderms. If you happen to know
Hindu mythology, you know about Akupara, the tortoise carrying a world
on its back. English philosopher and empiricist John Locke was certainly
aware back in the seventeenth century. We’ve already said Pratchett was
aware; hence his inclusion of the Great A’Tuin, the giant turtle upon
which the four elephants (Great T’Phon, Tubul, Jerakeen, and Berilia)
carrying the Disc ride. (A fifth elephant, discussed in The Fifth
Elephant, is just a legend.)

Elephants play a big role in Hindu mythology. Not only does the Hindu
god Indra ride one (Airavata—the first elephant created), elephants
supposedly are the mounts of choice for the guardian gods at the eight
points of the compass. (Some people prefer horses as destriers.) So,
it’s only fitting that elephants, like Atlas the Titan in Greek
mythology, hold up the world.

A’Tuin isn’t the only chelonian mentioned in Discworld (although it is
the largest, being a star turtle). The Great God Om (Small Gods) is a
small tortoise for much of the time (and a grumpy one at that) until
more people believe in him.

 

And Yet There’s the Yeti. You’ve undoubtedly heard stories of the yeti,
the ape-man creatures loping around the Himalayas and supposedly leaving
their scalps around monasteries. (We don’t make these things up.) These
are “the abominable snowmen” of many stories. (The Tibetans have the
yeti. In North America, we have Bigfoot and Sasquatch.) But only
Pratchett (see Thief of Time) mentions the “sword trick”—cutting off a
yeti’s head and having it come back to life.

Are yeti real or mythological? Scientists aren’t really sure, even after
several expeditions to track them. The jury’s still out on Bigfoot, as
well.

 

Stories? She’s Got a Thousand of ’Em. The stories woven through one
master storyteller, Scheherazade, in The Arabian Nights or The 1001
Arabian Nights, are myths from Persia (now Iran), Asia, India, and
Arabia and were written in the tenth through the fourteenth centuries.
Maybe you read the collection of stories compiled by Andrew Lang
(usually relegated to the kids’ section of the library) or the complete
tales found in the nonfiction section of the library. Pratchett, like
Scheherazade, wove several stories (or allusions to stories) from The
Arabian Nights into one book: Sourcery. Check it out: The cowardly
Rincewind’s journey to Al Khali, a city in Klatch, his dealings with
Creosote, the Seriph of Al Khali, and Abrim the evil vizier who
instigates the Mage Wars (see also chapter 7)—all are reminiscent of
stories in the Arabian Nights collection, particularly “Aladdin and the
Wonderful Lamp,” “The Three Princes and the Princess Nouronnihar,” and
the Haroun al-Raschid, Caliph of Baghdad, stories. A major nod to The
Arabian Nights comes through the mention of a flying carpet and a magic
lamp from the seriph’s treasury. Contrary to the 1992 Disney movie
Aladdin (which drew some inspiration from The Thief of Bagdad, a movie
from 1940), the flying carpet comes from “The Three Princes and the
Princess Nouronnihar.”

Another oblique nod (we think) to The Arabian Nights is the
character of Rincewind who, like Sinbad, the intrepid sailor of seven
voyages, journeys around the world and encounters many dangers. Unlike
Sinbad, however, who at least wanted to go on some of the voyages,
Rincewind is dragged kicking and screaming.

By the way, Creosote is an allusion to Croesus—the king of Lydia in
560-546 B.C., who was known for being wealthy, hence the idiom “rich as
Croesus.” Of course, you knew that.

DISCWORLD: AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT?

The decision as to what form the house shall take is made on
sociocultural grounds—way of life, shared group values, and “ideal”
environment sought.

Amos Rapoport, House Form and Culture¹⁸

An architect also has to be an anthropologist of sorts in order to make
his or her designs functional and culturally relevant. Terry Pratchett
is an anthropologist as well—perhaps not in degree, but in his
experience as a journalist and in the stories from other cultures he has
read. The curios and connections he gained through stories added to the
crucible in which Discworld was born.

Discworld has several people groups, some of which have a changing
cultural identity based on the region they’re in. For example, the
dwarfs in Shmaltzberg might act a little differently than do the dwarfs
in Ankh-Morpork. Angua, a werewolf from Uberwald, opposes some of the
practices of her family back home. But Pratchett still keeps the basic
cultural identities of dwarfs and werewolves found in literature.
Werewolves are still people who transform into wolves (or, in the case
of the yennork, a werewolf who doesn’t
change at all). Witches are still witches. Immortals (personifications),
while they may work as milkmen at times (e.g., Ronny Soak, alias Kaos)
or look like men (the Wintersmith), are still, well, elementals. It’s
elementary. (Just keeping up with our end of the bargain concerning the
bad puns.)

So, how does Pratchett give shape to the cultural identities of his
people/creature groups? Some classic stories inspire him.

Full of Fairy Tales … and Classic Tales

If you made the trek to see any of the Shrek movies, chances are you
probably liked fairy tales as a kid (and still do, if you’re honest with
yourself; we know you record The Fairly OddParents on TiVo). The
fairy-tale collections of Charles Perrault in seventeenth-century
France, the Brothers Grimm (Jacob and Wilhelm) from Germany, Peter
Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe from Norway in the eighteenth
century, and Scotsman Andrew Lang in the nineteenth influenced many
fantasy writers, including Terry Pratchett.

“Little Red Riding Hood,” a story all three collections have in common,
also finds its way into Pratchett’s Witches Abroad—one of the Lancre
witch novels featuring Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick.
Perrault’s “Cinderella” story also is integral to the plot. Since the
novel deals with the fulfillment of stories, it includes a plethora of
nods to other well-known fairy tales from the three collections:
“Sleeping Beauty” (also alluded to in Mort), “The Frog Prince,”
“Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” “Hansel and Gretel” (also alluded to
in The Light Fantastic), “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” and
“Rumpelstiltskin.”

In each of Pratchett’s allusions, the characters behave in a way readers
can easily recognize from fairy tales. But he places his own spin on the
situations. Although fairy godmothers still provide pumpkin coaches,
Magrat winds up turning everything into pumpkins at first. Black Aliss
is the wicked witch shut up in the oven in a
Hansel and Gretel-like way. The frog prince (really a duc—French for
“duke” and “horned owl”—go figure), who is hardly a Prince Charming,
tries to marry the Cinderella of the story.

In Thief of Time, Pratchett alludes to Grimm’s Fairy Tales when Jeremy
Clockson reads Grim Fairy Tales, which contains such stories as “The Old
Lady in the Oven” (gotta be a Hansel and Gretel story) and “The Glass
Clock of Bad Schüschein.”

The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents is one large allusion to
the Pied Piper of Hamelin story, a story the Grimm brothers included and
one that inspired poet Robert Browning. Pratchett also mentions the
story of “Puss in Books” from Charles Perrault’s collection and “Dick
Livingstone and his wonderful cat”—an allusion to Dick Whittington, a
story Andrew Lang collected (which is partially based on the life of
Richard Whittington the Lord Mayor of London), and Ken Livingstone the
Leader of the Greater London Council until 1986. He became Mayor of
London in 2002.

Every culture has folktales. Pratchett is undoubtedly familiar with the
folktales of Norway, judging by his allusion to East of the Sun, West of
the Moon in Lords and Ladies. That story comes from the fairy-tale
collection of Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe published in
1845, another volume of which was published in 1879.

 

The Devil Made Me Do It. As you may or may not know, Faust, the epic by
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, featuring a Job-like agreement and a contest
of wills between Faust and Mephistopheles, is parodied in Eric. Instead
of the pious Doktor Faust, there’s Eric, a fourteen-year-old who wants
to meet the most beautiful woman in the world, have mastery over the
kingdoms, and live forever—apt goals according to some in our world.
Having a huge amount of gold would be nice, too. But instead of
summoning someone like Mephistopheles, Eric summons Rincewind.

In Faust, Mephistopheles tried and failed to gain Faust’s soul through
similar temptations—the pleasures of life, the search for
the most beautiful woman in the world (Helen of Troy), a desire for
power. As we mentioned earlier, Helen is Elenor in Eric.

As the scenery of Pandemonium—the place to which Eric journeys—is
described, we can’t help also seeing the influence of The Divine Comedy,
the fourteenth-century Dante Alighieri classic, and Paradise Lost, John
Milton’s epic take on the temptation and fall of man, published in 1667.
The city Eric comes to, which is surrounded by a lake of lava, has
“unparalleled views of the Eight Circles”¹⁹—like the nine circles of
Dante’s Inferno, the first cantica of The Divine Comedy. The name
Pandemonium is a reference to Lucifer’s palace of the same name in
Paradise Lost.

In Inferno, you see some elements similar to Greek mythology in the use
of the River Acheron and Charon the ferryman. In the journey through the
Underworld described in Wintersmith, the taciturn river ferryman is like
Charon and the river is like Acheron.

 

A Book to Sink Your Teeth Into. Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic novel Dracula
is the great-great-grandfather of many a vampire story, even though it
wasn’t actually the first vampire story written. (John William Polidori
wrote “The Vampyre,” published in 1819. But even that wasn’t the first,
although it started the tradition of the vampire story in literature.)
As Pratchett gives shape to the fortified communities of Uberwald, a
land “with no real boundaries and lots of forest in between”²⁰ plus
plenty of howling wolves, you see echoes of the Transylvania the
unfortunate Jonathan Harker saw in Dracula, with its howling wolves and
mile after mile of forested land.

Pratchett’s vampires run the gamut from bloodthirsty (the de Magpyrs of
Carpe Jugulum) to black ribboners (Lady Margolotta
von Uberwald in The Fifth Elephant, Lance-constable Sally von Humpeding
in Thud!, Otto Chriek in The Truth and other books, Maladict/Maladicta
in Monstrous Regiment) who have taken the pledge to avoid the usual diet
of vampires, to wannabes (Doreen Winkings—Countess Notfaroutoe in The
Reaper Man and Thud!—who isn’t really a vampire, but acts as if she is).

In Carpe Jugulum, the name Magpyr is an allusion to the
Magyars—Hungarians in western Transylvania in the nineteenth century.
Vlad is an allusion to Vlad Tepes also known as Vlad the Impaler, the
fifteenth-century ruler of Walachia known for impaling prisoners. Of
course, you knew that. Stoker used Tepes as a model of sorts for Count
Dracula. Not content to stop at that reference, Pratchett references a
character known as Griminir the Impaler, a female vampire who merely bit
people but did not suck their blood.

The name Notfaroutoe is an allusion to the movie adaptations of Dracula,
namely the 1922 silent movie Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and its
1979 remake Nosferatu the Vampyre by Werner Herzog.

 

“That’s Fronck-en-shteen” Mary Shelley’s creation came “to life” in 1818
and spawned Frankenstein movies as well as the Igor tradition in
Discworld. Although there is no character named “Igor” in Shelley’s
book, an Igor appears in many of the films based on the book (like Mel
Brooks’s classic, Young Frankenstein, starring Gene Wilder where Igor—or
rather, Eye-gore—is played by Marty Feldman).

While visiting Lord Byron in 1816, Shelley (then Mary Woll-stonecraft
Godwin), John William Polidori (the physician of Lord Byron), and
Shelley’s then husband-to-be, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, were encouraged
by Byron to each write a scary story. Shelley wrote Frankenstein.
Polidori wrote “The Vampyre.” And thus history was made.

Jeremy Clockson plays a sort of Victor Frankenstein-like creator
in Thief of Time. Instead of using lightning to bring life to a creature
amassed out of corpses’ body parts, he uses it to bring the ultimate
clock to life. It’s apt that he’s assigned an Igor (yes, there’s more
than one) to help him, since Igors usually work for vampires, mad
scientists, and other criminally insane individuals.

Throughout Discworld, the Igors carry on the Victor Frankenstein
tradition by operating on themselves and others as well as recycling
spare body parts. Just doing their bit to help the environment.

 

Ringing in the New. Moving along on this architectural tour, we come to
one of the pillars of fantasy fiction. J. R. R. Tolkien is widely
considered the father of twentieth-century fantasy. Pratchett read
Tolkien’s trilogy during his childhood, and describing how he felt when
he first read the trilogy, Pratchett remarked in an essay, “I can
remember the vision of beech woods in the Shire … I remember the light
as green, coming through trees. I have never since then so truly had the
experience of being inside the story.”²¹

Maybe that’s why several allusions to Tolkien’s works became part of the
Discworld makeup. In Equal Rites, Gandalf’s single state gets a
shout-out in the second paragraph of the first chapter. In Lords and
Ladies, witches are referred to as having minds “like
metal”²²—reminiscent of Treebeard’s description of Saruman in The Two
Towers : “He has a mind of metal and wheels.”²³ A scene in Witches
Abroad provides an allusion to aspects of The Fellowship of the Ring and
The Hobbit. Perhaps you caught it. While on their way to Genua by boat,
Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick spy with their little
eyes a “small gray creature, vaguely froglike” on a log, who is
whispering of his “birthday.”²⁴ As you know, in The Hobbit
Gollum referred to the ring as his birthday present. And in Fellowship,
Frodo, Sam, and Aragorn noticed that Gollum used a log to follow them
while they traveled on the river Anduin. And of course, the draco
nobilis in Guards! Guards! sitting on a hoard of gold brings to mind
Smaug from The Hobbit.

In Wintersmith, during the Underworld journey, Roland recalls his time
as the prisoner of the queen of the elves, an event that takes place in
The Wee Free Men: “I could hardly remember anything after a while. Not
my name, not the feel of the sunshine, not the taste of real food.”²⁵
His words are an allusion to Frodo’s words in Return of the King in
response to Sam’s question concerning the rabbits Frodo and Sam ate in
Ithilien, earlier in their journey (The Two Towers): “I know that such
things happened, but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of
water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image
of moon or star are left to me.”²⁶

 

A-Head of His Time. If you saw Sleepy Hollow, the 1999 movie starring
Johnny Depp (directed by Tim Burton), you’re undoubtedly familiar with
“The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” the short story written by American
author Washington Irving, published in 1820. The story is a staple in
many elementary school curricula, especially around Halloween. The
setting is Sleepy Hollow, an area near Tarrytown, New York, a place of
“haunted spots, and twilight superstitions”²⁷—the home of the legendary
Headless Horseman, the so-called ghost of a Hessian soldier killed
during the Revolutionary War, who frightened the ill-fated schoolmaster,
Ichabod Crane. His fright, however, was due to the shenanigans of Brom
(Bones) Van Brunt—his rival for the affections of Katrina Van Tassel.

A headless horseman makes an appearance in The Wee Free Men and thus
provides another building block for Discworld. Too bad Ichabod Crane
didn’t have the Nac Mac Feegles (see chapter 10) on his side. They prove
to be a huge help to Tiffany Aching who encounters the headless
horseman.

 

“Phantastic” Voyage. George MacDonald is another author who helped
inspire a cornice or two in Discworld. If you read his novel Phantastes,
you read of Anodos, a man who wakes up to discover himself in Fairy
Land. As with many “Otherworld” trips, there is delight mixed with
horror.

Pratchett’s Fairyland, a place you travel through in The Wee Free Men,
is a ramped-up Neverland, where everything tries to harm you instead of
just one jealous pixie like Tinker Bell. Traveling through it is like
taking a trip through an evil version of Wonderland or the everyday
version of the Matrix (i.e., evil) where Agent Smiths abound. But there
is wonder as well, however, with talking daisies (reminiscent of the
talking flowers of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland ). However,
creatures like the dromes, grimhounds, and bumblebee women take the joy
out of the journey.

 

An Oz Encore. Perhaps you think of Oz only in terms of the prison drama
on HBO from 1997-2003. Another building block of Discworld comes from L.
Frank Baum’s classic children’s series of that name. Some aspects of the
1939 movie based on Baum’s first book (The Wizard of Oz) are alluded to
in Witches Abroad. The witches fly on broomsticks, a reminder of an
image Dorothy saw during the tornado: the evil Miss Gulch turning into a
wicked witch flying on a broomstick. Later, when a farmhouse falls on
Nanny Ogg and a “dwarf” asks for Nanny Ogg’s red boots but doesn’t know
why he asks for them, you can’t help thinking of the scene in the
Munchkins’
Country (or Munchkinland as the movie refers to it) where Dorothy’s
farmhouse fell on the Wicked Witch of the East and Dorothy gained the
ruby slippers (silver in the book). It’s only fitting that the fate of
one witch befall another (one decidedly nicer, however).

When Granny Weatherwax and Magrat argue (an inevitability when they get
together), each deciding that a person needs more brain or more heart
(page 165 of the paperback edition of Witches Abroad), you can’t help
thinking of what the Scarecrow and Tin Man each thought he needed.

During the argument, Nanny notices that the road to Genua is paved with
yellow bricks—an allusion to the yellow brick road leading to the
Emerald City of Oz. Genua even sparkles like the Emerald City.

Still another nod to The Wizard of Oz comes in Moving Pictures, where an
actor describes the plot of the click—or movie—he’s working on as “going
to see a wizard. Something about following a yellow sick toad.”²⁸

But an oblique reference to The Wizard of Oz (possibly) can be found in
Pyramids, when the Sphinx tells young Teppic, “Thou art in the presence
of the wise and the terrible.” The fake wizard of Oz described himself
as “Oz, the Great and Terrible.”²⁹

 

 

Even with such building blocks, Pratchett still needs the best patching
materials—his imagination, skill, and humor—to ensure that the three
purposes of good architecture are fulfilled.

That concludes this leg of the tour. Please notice the tip jar on your
way out.

Fully Realized Worlds

Discworld works because it takes itself seriously. The people in
Ankh-Morpork don’t think they’re being funny.

—Terry Pratchett at an October 12, 2006, book signing (Anderson
Bookshop, Naperville, Illinois)

Some fantasy worlds can seem as real as your backyard—almost like you
could step into it the moment you open the book. Worlds like …

 

The Star Wars Galaxy (various planets

“a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away”)

The incredibly popular film series created by George Lucas chronicled
the rise of the Galactic Empire and spawned many series of books written
by authors as disparate as Terry Brooks, Jude Watson, Elizabeth Hand,
Troy Denning, Kathy Tyres, R. A. Salvatore, Michael Stackpole, and many
more.

Lucas came up with the mythology of the various planets (Tatooine,
Naboo, Alderaan, Dagobah, and others), cultures, and characters like
Luke Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Han Solo, C3PO, and so on, and
revolutionized the movie industry as well as science fiction in general.

 

Middle-earth

In his quest to develop a mythology for England, Tolkien created a
mythical place that seems like an actual place in history. The moment
you walk into Bilbo Baggins’s hobbit hole in the Shire and trek through
the region of Eriador all the way through Mordor, you get a
sense of being in a believable world. (And after the movies, beautifully
realized by Peter Jackson and hundreds of craftspeople, Middle-earth
seems even more real.)

Like Pratchett, Tolkien was inspired by Norse mythology. Middle-earth is
Midgard—the home of men in Norse mythology.

 

Pern

Anne McCaffrey has multiple series that take place on Pern, a planet in
the Rukbat System. This planet’s Earth-like environment came at a price
for settlers, thanks to the threat of Threadfall—the silver spores
deposited by an orbiting planet, Red Star. Because the Thread attacked
all organic matter, the technologically advanced society returned to a
medieval state. Only dragonfire could stop the Thread.

Kahrain, Araby, and Cathay were just a few of the provinces established
in the first landing. The society became divided among the weyrs (the
homes of the dragons and their riders), the holds (lord-ruled lands),
and the halls (those of craftspeople). The series continues under the
pen of McCaffrey’s son, Todd.

 

Arrakis/Dune

Frank Herbert’s award-winning epic series (now known as “classic Dune”)
of political intrigue in space took place on the desert planet Arrakis,
a fiefdom run by the House Atreides. Arrakis, populated by Fremen and
sandworms, was the place for melange, a spice valued throughout the
universe. The Fremen searched for their Messiah—Muad’Dib—while House
Atreides and House Harkonnen battled each other for control of Arrakis.

The series began in 1965 and after Herbert’s death was continued by his
son, Brian, and Kevin Anderson.

 

Earthsea

Ursula LeGuin’s archipelago of islands (Gont, Roke, Karego-At, Atuan,
Havnor, etc.) is the setting where magic and mayhem abound. In A Wizard
of Earthsea to The Other Wind and books of Earthsea short stories,
LeGuin showed the history of Earthsea from the Creation of Eá through
Ged’s birth and rise from wizard to archmage to Tenar’s adoption of
Therru/Tehanu the dragon/child, who reached adulthood.

With Ged’s wandering tendencies, readers tour the islands from Roke to
the farthest shore where dragons fly and the dead walk. In this series,
prepare to see dragons, creatures of the Old Powers, and plenty of feats
of magic.

 

The Hyborian Age of Conan

Robert E. Howard’s creation, Conan the Barbarian, a.k.a. Conan the
Cimmerian, lives on thanks to such writers as L. Sprague de Camp, Lin
Carter, Robert Jordan, and Dale Rippke.

Conan lived in the Hyborian Age, supposedly after Atlantis sank but
before other civilizations sprang into being. Kingdoms like Nemedia,
Ophir, Zamora, Brythunia, Hyperborea, and Aquilonia sprawled across this
mythical form of Earth. Hyperborea, from Greek mythology, was the
original happiest kingdom on earth (way before Disney World)—a vacation
spot for Apollo. Some believed that Hyperborea was Great Britain.

Having been a warrior, a thief, a mercenary, and a pirate, Conan later
became king of Aquilonia—the most powerful kingdom. Not your average
hero. When you read the exploits of Cohen the Barbarian in Interesting
Times and The Last Hero, you can’t help but see the parody.

The books spawned two Conan movies, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, one
in 1982 and the other in 1984.

 

Hogwarts and the London of Harry Potter

J. K. Rowling, the only author who outsells Terry Pratchett in Britain
and possibly every other author in the world, created an instantly
memorable character in Harry Potter and the other students and faculty
of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although the stories take
place in modern-day England, Rowling’s world of wizards and witches is
almost an alternate universe, where Muggles are not allowed.

The movies bring to life the Hogwarts of our imaginations with its
gloomy edifice surrounded by rolling hills and eerie forest. Inside the
castle, the ghosts, moving stairways, dark passages, and “live” pictures
are all there—as is the incredible danger Harry and his friends face.

 

Star Trek’s Worlds

The old television series, created by Gene Roddenberry in 1966, spawned
other series and well over one hundred books. In the twenty-third
century after a third world war, Captain James T. Kirk and his intrepid
crew traveled from planet to planet “boldly going where no man has gone
before.” The governing body for humans and aliens was the United
Federation of Planets. (Kind of reminds you of the Republic, doesn’t
it?)

The first series was written by James Blish until his death. But many,
many writers, including Margaret Armen, Larry Niven, Gordon Eklund,
Walter Koenig, Michael Jan Friedman, and Diane Duane, contributed to the
series. Then came other TV series and books: Star Trek: The Next
Generation: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; Star Trek: Voyager; and Star
Trek: Enterprise.

 

Midkemia/Kelewan

Raymond Feist’s Riftwar Saga covered the wars with the Tsurani, an alien
race of beings from Kelewan. Pug, one of the main characters
of the series, lived on Midkemia, a planet with three continents
established by feudal societies, where dukes and princes lived
peacefully or at war with elves, dark elves (moredhel), and dwarves. As
with many fantasy lands, magic abounded. Oh, and there were dragons and
dragonlords, too.

The Tsurani society had a Far East flavor while the Midkemians went the
medieval Europe route. Other series followed such characters as Arutha
and Pug beyond the Riftwar drama.

 

The World of the Wheel of Time

Robert Jordan’s massive Wheel of Time series might seem like The Lord of
the Rings upon first glance with its Emond’s Field, the Shire-like
village from which Rand al’Thor and his friends (Mat, Egwene, Perrin)
hailed. After all, we know we’re in the midst of a society like
something out of a Renaissance fair. The world opened much wider as Rand
traveled with his friends and the Aes Sedai—a female channeler or
mage—and later went their separate ways (a breaking of the fellowship).
With its Westlands, city states (Tar Valon), blighted areas, and seas,
you feel as if you live there.

Terry Pratchett: Man of Mystery

A CONVERSATION IN THREE ACTS

Act I, Scene I: In Which the Players Are Discussed

Setting: Your home or wherever you happen to be now.

 

Us: Take a street-smart detective/cop/medieval monk/nosy British
aristocrat/bounty hunter/little old lady well versed in psychology and
an impossible case, and what do you have? A definitive work of mystery
fiction by the likes of Terry Pratchett, P. D. James, Ed McBain, J. A.
Jance, Lawrence Block, Janet Evanovich, Sue Grafton, Agatha Christie,
Lilian Jackson Braun, Arthur Conan Doyle, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell
Hammett, Wilkie Collins, Edgar Allan Poe, Ellis Peters, Dorothy Sayers,
Sara Paretsky, Ross Macdonald, Ruth Rendell, Patricia Cornwell, Robert
Parker, Ngaio Marsh, Ken Follett, Tony Hillerman, Margery Allingham,
Georges Simenon, Donald Bain/Jessica Fletcher, and many others.

You: Terry Pratchett? Discworld Terry Pratchett?

Us: Glad you asked.

You: I really didn’t. I’m just reading this.

Us: Since you asked, consider the mysteries solved by Commander Samuel
Vimes and other members of the Watch.

Every great work of mystery fiction needs at least two ingredients: (1)
an intriguing mystery, many times involving a formidable adversary, and
(2) someone to solve it. In a mystery subgenre such as police
procedurals, a team of experts are put to the test. But many whodunit
mysteries rest on the personality of the leading detective—amateur or
professional.

The City Watch miniseries has many of the elements of mystery subgenres
(classic whodunits, private-eye novels, cozies, police procedurals,
suspense, thrillers) and defies them all.³⁰ For that reason, we’d dub
Pratchett’s main detective—Sam Vimes—the “Hardest-Working Crime Solver”
in mystery fiction. Wondering why?

You: Not really, no. But I’m sure you’ll tell me.

Us: We will in the next scene. We have a lot of lines in that one.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

Act I, Scene II: In Which Mystery Subgenres Are Discussed

Us: First, some handy definitions of mystery subgenres:

 

Whodunits

Who took the countess’s priceless diamond bracelet? Who killed the
blackmailer? With mysteries like these, the main question, naturally, is
“Whodunit?” The whodunit subgenre is the largest of the mystery
subgenres. In books of this ilk, “great ingenuity may be exercised in
narrating the events of the crime, usually a homicide, and of the
subsequent investigation in such a manner as to conceal the identity of
the criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method
and culprit are revealed.”³¹ This group includes “cozies”, “locked room”
mysteries, and “aristocop”³² mysteries. (For more on “aristocop”
mysteries, see “The Titled Crime Solvers: It’s in the (Blue) Blood”.)

With classic whodunits such as The Woman in White and The Moonstone by
Wilkie Collins, “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” by Edgar Allan Poe
(considered the first published detective story), or Bleak House by
Charles Dickens, you might think of the well-crafted plots faster than
the characters’ names.

You: Bleak House is on DVD. Let’s see, there’s Esther Summerson, Lady
Dedlock, Mr. Tulkinghorn, and there’s …

Us (interrupting): The Sherlock Holmes novels, on the other hand, are
classic whodunit detective novels. You might read them because of
Sherlock Holmes, rather than the plot specifically. (For more about
that, don’t miss “Vimes versus Holmes: The Smackdown” in Act II, Scene
I.)

You: My favorite Sherlock Holmes novel is—

Us: Let’s move on to private-eye novels. These are nonpolice detective
novels. The characters are realistic rather than eccentric. These
mysteries are populated by “old school” characters like Sam Spade,
Philip Marlowe, Nick and Nora Charles, Lew Archer, or the
Continental Op and “the next generation”: V. I. Warshawski, Matthew
Scudder, Kinsey Millhone, Stephanie Plum, or the erudite Spenser (no
revealed first name). (If you’re confused about which author wrote which
character, see the end of the chapter for a list.)

This is where personality counts. Many private eyes in fiction have
similar traits. They’re tough (they have to be, to solve the grisly
crimes in their beat), jaded, hard drinkers (or at least alcoholics on
the mend), and have enough determination to stay with a case even after
someone tries to run them over or push them out of a window. Most are
good at what they do, or at least keep at a job until the truth is
revealed.

 

Cozies. According to an article written by mystery writer Stephen P.
Rodgers,³³ a cozy mystery is “a mystery which includes a bloodless crime
and contains very little violence, sex, or coarse language. By the end
of the story, the criminal is punished and order is restored to the
community.”

With cozy mysteries, you might think of such characters as Hercule
Poirot, Jane Marple, Lord Peter Wimsey, Jessica Fletcher, Jim Qwilleran/
Koko/Yum Yum. (You can’t get much cozier than two cats.) Rather than
ranked as strictly amateur sleuths, characters like Hercule Poirot and
Lord Peter Wimsey are considered criminologists and are regularly
consulted by the police. (And Poirot is a former cop.)

 

Police procedurals. According to a definition posted at the Mystery
Guide site, “police procedurals must be realistic depictions of official
investigations. They emphasize teamwork, methodical pavement-pounding,
lucky breaks, administrative hassles, and endless paperwork.”³⁴

If you’re a fan of such shows as Prime Suspect, CSI, or Law and Order
(with all of its spin-offs)—

You: What has this got to do with Terry Pratchett?

Us (as if you hadn’t spoken):—you probably like your mysteries by the
book, according to realistic police procedures. This is the form
popularized in America by the late Ed McBain, Patricia Cornwell, Tony
Hillerman, J. A. Jance, Joseph Wambaugh, and many others. But looking at
the European police scene, you’ll find such characters as Roderick
Alleyn, Adam Dalgliesh, Endeavour Morse, the world-weary Jules Maigret,
Reginald Wexford, and the forensics experts Brother Cadfael or Kay
Scarpetta. These crime solvers walk a grisly beat.

 

Suspense. Sometimes suspense and thrillers are lumped together. In
suspense stories, the focus is on whether the villain will be caught
before he or she strikes again. These are the edge-of-your-seat
mysteries, many of which involve females as lead characters—the kind who
can’t help investigating even when the body count climbs. When you think
of suspense, you might think of writers like Mary Higgins Clark
(Moonlight Becomes You), Nancy Atherton (Aunt Dimity Goes West), or Anne
Perry (The Cater Street Hangman ). We would add Terry Pratchett to that
list, even though Vimes has never shown his feminine side.

You: I see. I would’ve preferred a chart, though. Visual aids rule, you
know.

Us: Moving on to the thriller, the focus is on fast-paced action where
chase scenes and technology abound. The villains may be megalomaniacs
bent on taking over the world or simply average joes gone postal. With
thrillers, the main element is time. The clock is ticking to catch that
kidnapper before the victim is killed or the bomb explodes. Writers like
Tom Clancy, Ken Follett, and Elmore Leonard are well known in this
subgenre.

Act I, Scene III: The Plot Thickens

Whodunits

Us: The Pratchett novels Men at Arms and Feet of Clay can be described
as “who-or-what-dunits,” thanks to the fact that you never know what
species (dragon, dwarf, werewolf, vampire, golem, troll, etc.) might
have done the crime. Even so, both novels have the same “whodunit”
elements as do classic works by Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and
Edgar Allan Poe. See for yourself as we compare Feet of Clay to Collins
and Dickens’s novels.

You (happily): A chart! (See charts on pages 36 and 37.)

Us: The Fifth Elephant also has a locked-room mystery element as Vimes
investigates the theft of the famed Scone of Stone from a locked museum
and a mysterious death that took place in a locked area.

Act II, Scene I: Enter … the Detective

Vimes versus Holmes: The Smackdown

Us: Sherlock Holmes is unquestionably the most famous detective in
fiction.

You: No question about that.

Us: But Holmes is the kind of clue-analyzing detective who rubs a
clue-hating cop like Vimes the wrong way. A discussion of methods might
result in a Smackdown battle of Vimes and Holmes. We can’t help but
wonder who would win in a battle of the minds. Maybe it would go like
this.

You: Will Holmes and Vimes enter from stage left or stage right? Us
(brightly, because we always agree with you): Uh, thanks for sharing
that. Take it away, Holmes and Vimes.

Holmes: “How often have I said … that when you have eliminated

the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth?”³⁵

 

 

[e9781429934886_i0002.jpg]

³⁶

[e9781429934886_i0003.jpg]

Vimes: “The real world was far too real to leave neat little hints. It
was full of too many things. It wasn’t by eliminating the impossible
that you got at the truth, however improbable; it was by the much harder
process of eliminating the possibilities.”³⁷

Holmes: “I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem,
and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction …
are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second
nature.”³⁸

Vimes: “Every real copper knew you didn’t go around looking for Clues so
that you could find out Who Done It. No, you started out with a pretty
good idea of Who Done It. That way, you knew what Clues to look for.”³⁹

Holmes: “There is no branch of detective science which is so important
and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.”⁴⁰ Vimes: “I
never believed in that stuff—footprints in the flower bed, tell tale
buttons, stuff like that. People think that stuff’s policing. It’s not.
Policing’s luck and slog, most of the time.”⁴¹

 

Pratchett and the Private Eye

Us: Although Vimes isn’t a private investigator, he’s asked to turn in
his badge a number of times during the course of the series, which
forces him to act like one. (See Jingo and Guards! Guards!) So, how does
he fit in the hard-edged world populated by the likes of Kinsey
Millhone, Philip Marlowe, and Sam Spade?

[e9781429934886_i0004.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0005.jpg]

⁴²

You: Uh, you’ll use another chart, perhaps?

Us: Good idea! (See chart here.)

Us: Vimes may be hard-boiled like this lot, but he’s also slightly
cracked, thanks to living in Pratchett’s world. Like Marlowe, he can be
insubordinate, even though he can never one-up Vetinari, Ankh-Morpork’s
Patrician. Like Sam Spade, Sam Vimes is quick with an elbow when it
comes to a fight. And, like Sam Spade, he fights dirty.

Like all classic fiction private eyes, Vimes works cheap—more than
Carrot’s $43 per month, plus allowances (the Last Hero rate). (Marlowe
earns $25 dollars a day, plus expenses, and Archer gets $50 a day, plus
expenses.)

 

Murder with a Cozy Feel

Us: Although many of Pratchett’s mysteries take place within the teeming
sprawl of Ankh-Morpork, some have a cozy element. So, while Pratchett
might mention that a man has been beaten to death with a loaf of dwarf
bread (and that’s easy to believe if you know about the consistency of
dwarf and other battle breads), you won’t actually see the crime take
place or see any (at least much) blood.

You: You mean like in Saw IV?

Us (as if you hadn’t spoken): While Fletcher and Marple have the edge on
coziness, Vimes at least is a contender.

 

The Titled Crime Solvers: It’s in the (Blue) Blood

Us: During a period known as the “Golden Age” of mysteries in Great
Britain (between World War I and World War II), such writers as Agatha
Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham, and Dorothy Sayers wrote their
novels. They were the “queens” of English detective mysteries, the
creators of the upper-class detectives Roderick Alleyn (Marsh), Albert
Campion (Allingham), and Peter Wimsey (Sayers).

[e9781429934886_i0006.jpg]

If they’re the queens, Pratchett must be the joker.

You (shifts uneasily at your current location on Earth): No comment.

Us: Pratchett plunks his square-peg character into the round hole of
this gentlemen’s league of suave, well-dressed, and well-educated
detectives—a description no one would dream of using for Vimes.

Here’s how he measures up to the other members of the gentlemen’s
league.

Us: Vimes would be the first to admit that, unlike his esteemed
colleagues, he’s no gentleman, nor the son of a gentleman. Thrust into
society, thanks to his marriage to Lady Sybil and promotions for
services rendered, Vimes is the thorn in everyone’s side. Vimes’s
problem is that he can’t stop annoying the upper crust—Lords Selachii,
Rust, and others, many of whom happen to be the assassins hired to kill
him or Vetinari. If he encountered Alleyn, Wimsey, or Campion, Vimes
might be tempted to stick him with a lobster fork rather than pass him
one.

[e9781429934886_i0009.jpg]

Police Procedurals: Murder by the Book

Us: With ex-magistrate/employees of the British Home Office (P. D.
James), you would expect accurate details about police procedures. But
what of Pratchett?

[e9781429934886_i0010.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0011.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0012.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0013.jpg]

You: Yeah, what of him?

Us: Thanks to his journalism background, you get the feel of the mean
streets, even if they’re fictional. Here’s how Pratchett’s copper
compares to the others. (Go back and read the table … until you’re back
here.)

 

Harrowing Horror and Subtle Suspense

Us: Every good suspense story needs a page-turning plot to keep you on
the edge of your seat. Although he does not churn out suspense novels in
the purest sense of the genre, Pratchett ratchets up the suspense
quotient in most of the books about the Watch. His books might aptly be
called horror suspense Buffy the Vampire Slayer/ Exorcist/Underworld
style. After all, Vimes has stared down dragons (Guards! Guards!),
negotiated with golems (Feet of Clay), wrestled and escaped from
murderous werewolves (The Fifth Elephant) and a venomous vampire (Feet
of Clay), and been influenced by evil entities such as the Summoning
Dark (Thud!) and the gonne, a whispering weapon invented by Leonard of
Quirm (Men at Arms) which destroyed the life of assassin Edward d’Eath.

Vimes has fallen out of windows, down mineshafts and waterfalls, and
escaped by the skin of his teeth, all for the sake of keeping our pulse
rates up and our lights burning far into the night as we follow his
exploits and those of the officers under his command—the always
unsettling Angua, the courageous Captain Carrot, and “dumb and dumber”
Colon and Nobby.

You: They’re more Laurel and Hardy-esque.

 

The Thrill of the Chase

Us: If you haven’t read much of the Discworld series—

You: I’ve read most of them.

Us (again as if you had not spoken):—you might envision Ankh-Morpork’s
quaint cobblestone streets, clacks towers, and stagecoaches as a
low-tech world far different from that of The Hunt for Red October and
other Tom Clancy creations. But for a plot that combines technology
Pratchett-style (which Vimes refers to as “technomancy”; for more about
that, read chapter 19) and political shenanigans—the kind a writer like
Clancy or Frederick Forsyth would discuss—look no further than Jingo. It
has a Day of the Jackal-meets-Hunt for Red October element with a side
order of JFK and Lawrence of Arabia. The technology kicks in with the
introduction of various Burleigh and
Stronginthearm’s weaponry (the Shureshotte Five and the ominous-sounding
Streetsweeper) and Leonard of Quirm’s
Going-Under-the-Water-Safely-Device, a.k.a. the Boat, which is really a
submarine.

The thrill and danger of the chase is the focus of The Fifth Elephant ,
when Vimes runs for his life from werewolves playing “the game,” and of
Night Watch, when Vimes chases Carcer, a psychopathic killer, through
time.

 

Act II, Scene II: The U(nu)sual Suspects

“If the point of your story is ‘whodunit,’ the culprit needs to be worth
the finding. Often the nature of the villain, and how absorbing a
character he or she is, will affect the flavor of the whole rest of the
story.”⁴⁴

 

You: Where’d that come from?

Us: You’ll have to check the footnote. A good mystery needs a worthy
adversary who makes the detective earn his or her pay. Sherlock Holmes
has criminal genius Professor Moriarty (The Final Problem, The Valley of
Fear), Jack Stapleton (The Hound of the Baskervilles), Irene Adler
Norton (“A Scandal in Bohemia”), and others. Sam Spade and Philip
Marlowe have various double-crossing clients. Poirot has a slew of
murderers and thieves foolish or egotistical enough to match wits with
him.

You: A slew of murderers? Is that a collective term like a muster of
peacocks or a murder of ravens? A murder of murderers perhaps?

Us (hastily): But what of Vimes?

You: My cue to say, “Yeah, what of Vimes”?

Us: In a Pratchett-created world populated by werewolves, dragons,
vampires, assassins, golems, dwarfs, and trolls, the sky’s the limit for
unusual suspects.

Pratchett is adept at juxtaposing unusual villains with the evils of the
everyday. (For more on villains, see chapter 12.) Vimes’s prime
adversary is himself, followed a close second by the “politicians”—guild
leaders and Vetinari, who is incredibly skilled at mind games. And then
there’s everyone and everything else: corrupt cops and a psychopath
(Night Watch); dwarfs, werewolves, and vampires with political agendas
(The Fifth Elephant); corrupt civil servants and a confused but
dangerous dragon (Guards! Guards!); assassins with diabolical weapons
(Men at Arms); a crazed golem and a vampire with an agenda (Feet of
Clay); the corrupting evils of war and bureaucracy ( Jingo and Thud!);
and ancient supernatural evil (Thud!). Even a street-smart detective
like Sam Spade or a cop like J. P. Beaumont would be hard-pressed to
last in the minefield of Ankh-Morpork.

You: Not sure I agree with that. If they were born in Ankh-Morpork—

Us: Now let’s move on to the end.

You: Finally! (pauses) You get it? Finally …

Act III: The Denouement—All’s Well That Ends Well?

Us: Every good mystery needs a satisfactory ending.

You: That goes without saying … . Speaking of endings, I never finished
what I started to say about Ankh-Morpork at the end of the last scene.

Us: In some mysteries, a dramatic showdown occurs between the villain
and the hero/heroine. In others, the truth is revealed in a dramatic
fashion by the detective. (“At eight o’clock precisely in the drawing
room, I will reveal the murderer’s identity.”) In Pratchett’s mysteries,
you may find your views overturned as to who the villain really is. Is
Dee, the ideas taster of the Low King, really all “he” says “he” is in
The Fifth Elephant? Is a golem a tool or a person (Feet of Clay)? If it
is a tool, can it commit murder?

You: I wouldn’t mind having a golem to be my slave.

Us (nod, but move on quickly): Sometimes, although a mystery is solved,
some things, like bureaucracy, still continue, to Vimes’s chagrin.

Not content to bring their mystery story to a satisfactory conclusion,
some writers attempt to end their creations, and thus begin a new
chapter of their literary lives. Arthur Conan Doyle tried to end his
famous character by sending him over the Reichenbach Falls with
Moriarty. Simenon, too, tried to end the celebrated Maigret.

Pratchett thought he was done with Vimes after Guards! Guards! But the
fans responded positively. Now Vimes is a favorite of Pratchett’s, as he
revealed at a book signing in Naperville, Illinois. He’s a favorite with
us, too, obviously.

That’s our argument for why Vimes is the hardest-working detective in
mystery fiction. Any questions?

You: I’m sure you’ll think of some that I would have asked.

Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all.

and we must accept full responsibility for the consequences of these

THE MAKINGS OF A DISASTER MOVIE

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] The earth’s inner core stops rotating. The
eroding magnetic field will mean the deaths of billions. Chaos?

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] Frog DNA used to complete the DNA strand
causes uncontrolled breeding in dinosaurs, including vicious raptors.
Chaos?

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] An iceberg looms out of the darkness. A
huge luxury liner strikes it. Chaos?

Many think of chaos as any of the above—a chain of events gone horribly
wrong. In other words, the ingredients of a thriller/disaster movie such
as Core, Jurassic Park/The Lost World, and Titanic. But chaos is many
things. It’s certainly the “I don’t know what could happen if things
keep going the way they’re going” factor in a chain of events. It is a
quest standing on the edge of a knife, as Galadriel said in
Fellowship—one that could end in disaster if the quest fails. It’s the
slow unraveling of order—like a key thread pulled out of a sweater.
(It’s also anytime Carrie’s cat, Sassie, gets angry with Carrie’s border
collie, Wilfred. But that’s another story.)

Chaos as a theory in science evolved in the twentieth century. You know
the buzzwords: fractals (patterns that repeat a particular design), time
evolution, dynamical systems, nonlinear behavior, the butterfly effect.
(Yes, that was the name of the Ashton Kutcher movie from 2004.) Chaos is
often discussed in terms of entropy, the second law of thermodynamics
(“The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to
increase over time, approaching a maximum value”⁴⁷), since entropy is a
way to measure the chaos or order of a system.

You can find loads of references to chaos throughout Discworld, which
we’ll get to shortly. But first, what is chaos? For an answer to that,
we have to start at the beginning.

Roll credits … .

In the beginning, there was Chaos …

… according to the Greeks, particularly the Greek poet Hesiod. Chaos was
a god who ruled over the shapeless, preuniverse mass. Some would say he
personified this void. Supposedly out of Chaos came Nyx (Night). Nyx was
the wife of Chaos; they had a son, Erebus (Darkness). But then Erebus
decided that Nyx would make a good wife for him. (We would call that
incest.) Their union produced two offspring: Ether (Sky), and Hemera
(Day). Hesiod had lots to say
about that in his Theogony. But Ovid, a Roman poet, believed that Chaos
was matter without form (sort of like a movie with a weak storyline and
tacky sets). In his narrative poem Metamorphoses (which reminds us of
the title of that Kafka story usually read in high school—“The
Metamorphosis”), we read, “A lifeless lump, unfashion’d, and
unfram’d,/Of jarring seeds; and justly Chaos nam’d.”⁴⁸

But the theory of chaos evolved from a gleam in the eye of Henri
Poincaré, a mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who hoped to solve
the tricky two- or three-body problem in physics and astronomy. What’s
the three-body problem? We have to go to Newton’s theories for that.

And then there was Newton …

As you learned in physics or earth science, British
physicist/mathematician Sir Isaac Newton came up with three laws of
motion:

I. Every object in a state of uniform motion remains in that state of
motion unless an external force is applied to it.

II. The relationship between an object’s mass m, its acceleration a, and
the applied force F is F = ma.

III. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.⁴⁹

According to Newton, this creates a sort of built-in regularity in the
universe (tides, sun rising and setting, eclipses) like that of the
mechanism of a clock. Pratchett alludes to this in Thief of Time as “the
fabled ‘tick of the universe.’”⁵⁰ But other scientists wondered about
the effects of small irregularities in pull (also known as
“perturbations”—disturbances in the pattern) when the moon goes around
the Earth or the Earth orbits the sun. This is a three-body
problem: “How do three or more bodies move under their mutual
attractions of gravity?”⁵¹

Some astronomers came up with a theory known as the “perturbation
theory,” which meant shifting the calculation of an orbit to account for
tiny irregularities. But even that created more irregularities. That was
the problem Henri Poincaré tried to solve.

And then there was Poincaré, a bunch of mathematicians and scientists,
Edward Lorenz, and such writers as Michael Crichton …

Along came Poincaré, toward the end of the nineteenth century, with the
germ of chaos theory. He started with the issue of the buildup of tiny
irregularities known as “resonance.” When resonance upon resonance
occurs, instability can occur—something you can’t always predict. This
is chaos.

Mathematicians later theorized that repetition in some cycles can cause
repetitive changes in other cycles. This is known as “iteration”—using
the output of one equation as input for the next. They were one step
closer to the theory. But it needed computers to come to fruition. In
1963, Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist, used computers to experiment with
iterations in weather prediction and came up with a chaos breakthrough
that other mathematicians and scientists have since refined.

They discovered that tiny changes within a system can “perturb” the
system—one dependent on a certain set of conditions—into wildly
different behavior—the butterfly effect. This is why attempts by Evan
(Ashton Kutcher’s character in The Butterfly Effect) to make changes in
his life in the past wildly affected his life in the future (the
present). Famed author H. G. Wells discussed this aspect over a century
before in The Time Machine.

The “attractor” is an active ingredient in this system. Attractors
are patterns within a system that push the system toward a certain point
(kinda like some boyfriends we’ve had). In other words, they run a
stable system. “Strange attractors” (also like some boyfriends we’ve
had) are attractors within a chaotic system that take a system to a
different place and show a kind of order. (Sort of like the
well-mannered psychopath Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.) You
can thank Lorenz for the term “strange attractors” and for the butterfly
effect, which came from the butterfly shape of his charted pattern of a
strange attractor in weather. But the butterfly analogy is from ancient
China.

Now some systems are “self-organized”—able to return to a semblance of
order. Think of a city like Chicago or Paris. Order is maintained even
through bouts of chaos (riots, traffic, wars). Attractors (police, laws)
are at work there as well.

With a new theory in science like chaos floating around, book authors
and Hollywood were bound to take notice. You’ve already seen the results
if you saw The Butterfly Effect or any of the adaptations of The Time
Machine. But before that, Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park
(also a 1993 Steven Spielberg movie—yeah, ages ago) featured a
chaos-theory-spouting mathematician, Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff
Goldblum in the movie), who predicted the chaos of the dinosaur
experiment. If you read the various iterations of the experiment in the
book or saw the movie, you know dinosaurs ran amok, thus proving
Malcolm’s point.

But what about Pratchett? Drumroll, please …

And then there was Pratchett …

In many of his Discworld novels, Pratchett pushed the conflict to the
point of chaos and beyond. Since his created universe is constantly
destroyed and rebuilt anyway, as we’re told in Thief of Time, chaos is
constant.

In cracking the code on Discworld chaos, let’s start with some
allusions. You can find them in Witches Abroad, Interesting Times, The
Last Continent, and Wintersmith. At the beginning of Witches Abroad,
we’re in the world of chaos where the butterfly exists. In Interesting
Times, we’re told about “the butterfly of storms,” “the fractal nature
of the universe,” “Freak Gales Cause Road Chaos,” and the butterfly with
“mandelbrot patterns” on its wings—Mandelbrot being a reference to
Benoit Mandelbrot, a real-life mathematician and fractal geometry
guru.⁵² In The Last Continent, the wizards discuss how treading on an
ant or making any changes in the last continent (Fourecks) could change
their future existence (shades of The Time Machine). In Wintersmith, the
Summer Lady talks of resonance—the fact that she looks like Tiffany and
Tiffany acts like her. Tiffany’s insertion of herself in the Morris
dance causes this resonance. And the intrepid Commander Vimes in Men at
Arms muses that wizards occasionally “took the canoe of reality too
close to the white waters of chaos.”⁵³

Magic is a frequent contributor to chaos in Discworld. Unseen
University, particularly the High Energy Magic Building and the library,
contains enough ingredients to provide endless calamities. Think about
the chaos caused in Guards! Guards! by The Summoning of Dragons, a book
stolen from Unseen University’s library. Think of the wizards themselves
and their inept attempts to send Rincewind anywhere.

We talked about attractors earlier. Azrael (the Death of Universes),
Granny Weatherwax, Tiffany Aching, Lord Vetinari, Sergeant Jackrum
(Monstrous Regiment), Carrot Ironfoundersson, Death, and other
characters behave as attractors—those who pull others to a certain
point. They work overtly or behind the scenes. Azrael has to be the
biggest attractor of them all, since he’s known as “the Great Attractor”
(Reaper Man, 321). Ha! Ha! Actually, a “great attractor” in space is a
large mass about the size of thousands of galaxies
with an enormous amount of gravitational pull. That’s Azrael all over.
Just a big charming lump, really.

While characters such as Vimes and Susan are at the forefront of the
action in their stories, they’re often reactors to the attractor or the
strange attractor who comes on the scene and attempts to take the system
to a different place. Think about it. In Thief of Time, Death inspires
Susan to action by mentioning that someone like her was involved in
building the clock. Vetinari often manipulates Vimes into action by
telling Vimes what he shouldn’t do. And Carrot, possibly the rightful
heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, is the one responsible for Vimes
being the commander and knight that he is.

In the wizard miniseries, when chaos happens, Rincewind’s usually in the
thick of things. Check it out.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

Tiffany is unique in that she’s an attractor and a system bordering on
chaos. When the queen of the fairies (the strange attractor) steals
Tiffany’s brother, Wentworth, and tries to take over Tiffany’s world in
The Wee Free Men, Tiffany acts to pull the system back into order. In A
Hat Full of Sky, she repels another strange attractor—an invading entity
(the hiver) that attempts to pull her mind into chaos. In Wintersmith,
Tiffany gains the attention of still another strange attractor—the
Wintersmith—after leaping into the Morris dance, thus setting in motion
a change in the pattern that will ultimately bring chaos (endless
winter). Once again, she is a system bordering on chaos as she slowly
gains the power of the Summer Lady but isn’t sure what to do with it.

Thief of Time is another novel with strong elements of chaos. The
villainous Auditors (more on them in chapter 12) hire Jeremy Clockson to
build a clock to stop all clocks and trap Time (personified as a
female—more on her in chapter 9). The Auditors usually behave as the
strange attractors—beings who present a kind of order in chaos. They
believe the universe would run smoothly without humans or immortals like
Death and the Hogfather and use chaos to achieve that goal. But Lady
LeJean (a.k.a. Unity) is an Auditor who becomes an attractor and tries
to stop the other Auditors.

  Interesting Times     Twoflower again (through his pamphlet, What I Did on My Holidays)                                                                           Rincewind travels to the Agatean Empire and is believed to be a powerful wizard/revolutionary. As usual, whenever Rincewind is present, war is the result.
  The Last Continent    Rincewind and the wizards                                                                                                                   The presence of Rincewind and the wizards of Unseen University on the continent of Fourecks, still in its formative stages, causes changes that affect the fabric of the land.
  The Last Hero         Cohen the Barbarian and the Silver Horde                                                                                                    The Silver Horde takes a bomb to Dunmanifestin—the home of the gods—which goes off. Rincewind’s on hand as well.

As we mentioned before, the “tick of the universe” is an allusion to
Newton’s clock. In a universe governed by magic and chaos, regulating
the universe according to Newton’s clock would bring a reverse form of
chaos. (That would be order, wouldn’t it?)

Not only is chaos there, Kaos is there as well. The fifth horseman of
the Apocalypse is mild-mannered (until provoked) Ronnie Soak, a.k.a.
Kaos (not to be confused with KAOS—the secret organization
of criminals on Get Smart, the 1960s TV spoof of James Bond movies).
He’s a milkman, which is fitting for someone who once dealt with the
primordial milk of creation, so to speak. It takes Kaos, the Monks of
History, Lobsang Ludd (son of Time), and the intrepid Susan Sto Helit to
make things right. Achieving balance—entropy—is the key. The
procrastinators—the machines the monks monitor and use—are the symbols
of balanced time. They’re also an example of the perturbation theory—how
irregularities are compensated for to balance the equation. (For more on
procrastinators, see chapter 19.)

For other moments of chaos in Discworld (this list is by no means
exhaustive), see the chart here.

And soon there was order out of chaos …

Not content to leave everything in a mess, Pratchett shows how order
comes from chaos. This is also known as resolving the conflict.

So in The Last Hero, Carrot’s heroic intervention, like Alan Ladd’s in
High Noon or like any of the X-Men’s (except for the Phoenix), helps
prevent total chaos. This is also why Granny Weatherwax, another
attractor, can help Tiffany set things right in Wintersmith or any other
book in which Granny Weatherwax appears. This is why the Monks of
History soldier on, helping to repair the universe every time it is
destroyed.

And this is why Vetinari, the ultimate attractor as the Patrician in
Ankh-Morpork, maintains power in a city like Ankh-Morpork … .

The Discworld Tapestry: Can They All Get Along?

Can we all get along?

—Rodney King

The principal aim of the tapestry, obviously, was to cover the walls of
a given room completely, and to provide a homogeneous decoration which
related to both the walls and the furniture.⁵⁴

This is a chapter about a tapestry, but not like the Unicorn Tapestries,
one of the most famous sets of tapestries in the world, dating back to
1500. We’re talking about the tapestry of humanity. (Already, you’re
probably thinking, I’ve heard the tapestry analogy before. Cliché. But
bear with us.)

A tapestry is designed to cover a wall. A human tapestry covers a world.
In our world, the human tapestry consists of people of various races.
You know them. We don’t have to list them. If you saw the video for “We
Are the World” ages ago, attended a meeting at
the UN, or looked at Carrie’s pets, you’d see colors as varied as the
threads of a medieval tapestry. (Well, Carrie’s pets are only somewhat
varied color-wise. Two have a mostly black and white color scheme.
Sassie, the orange tabby, is in the minority. But the other two do not
discriminate.)

The people and species of creatures of Discworld form a unique tapestry
with threads from throughout literature. In chapter 1, we discussed how
various myths informed Pratchett’s choice of people or beings to
populate his series. But how do those people and beings fit together?
What are the warp and weft of their relationships?

In a tapestry, the various threads work together to show the whole
picture. In the Discworld tapestry, the “threads” often try their best
to pull out the other threads. It’s the same in our world. Let’s face
it—we don’t always get along. Hatred and prejudice wear a very human
face. You can probably easily think of books and movies that deal with
the reality of tense racial situations. For example, To Kill a
Mockingbird, A Time to Kill, To Sir with Love, The Defiant Ones (the
Tony Curtis/Sidney Poitier movie from 1958), West Side Story, Guess
Who’s Coming to Dinner (old and new), Amazing Grace, Amistad, The
Interpreter. Some of these tensions are played out in wars that stain
the human tapestry.

With such an explosive situation, maybe that’s why many sci-fi and
fantasy writers use alien races or even differing types of robots or
androids in their stories as a metaphor for race relations. Think of the
Vulcans and Romulans in the first Star Trek series. Think of the Daleks
and Cybermen in the most recent Doctor Who series on BBC One. (Well, the
Daleks and Cybermen hate everyone but themselves. And they’re not all
robot, either. Cybermen have human brains and the Daleks are
bad-tempered small aliens in armored suits. No wonder prejudicial
thoughts occur.)

Although there are no “aliens” per se in Discworld, Pratchett shows race
relations among humans and between humans and other species. Let’s look
at the human factor first.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

PATTERN I: THE HUMAN FACTOR

We have met the enemy and he is us.

—Walt Kelly,⁵⁵ creator of Pogo comic strip

Klatch vs. Ankh-Morpork

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character.

—Martin Luther King

In Jingo, a mysterious island rich in treasures (or so the rumor goes)
is a hotbed of contention between the people of Klatch and of
Ankh-Morpork. Pratchett weaves the threat of war in with moments of
slapstick. But more than that, we see the attitudes of the people of
Ankh-Morpork and of Klatch toward each other, especially when Vimes is
asked to explain a derogatory remark leveled at a visiting prince from
Klatch. And even Vimes has to explore his attitude toward 71-hour Ahmed,
the clove-eating cultural attaché and bodyguard. (But then, Vimes never
pretends to be PC.)

The island ownership issue sparks race-related skirmishes in
Ankh-Morpork. We’ve certainly heard about or experienced those in our
country. During the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, riots
broke out in Chicago, Birmingham, and other places. The death threats
during Prince Cadram’s diplomatic visit to
Ankh-Morpork reminded us of the threats Martin Luther King received
while organizing nonviolent protests—threats that culminated in his
assassination in 1968. But race riots didn’t end there. The verdict
after the trial of police officers caught on video beating Rodney King
sparked a three-day riot in Los Angeles in 1992.

War over a piece of land is a familiar tune played over centuries. In
the United States as the West was settled, soldiers fought Native
Americans over the plains. The Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876
(a.k.a. Custer’s last stand) was fought over the Black Hills of South
Dakota. Miners wanted the area for the gold they found. The Lakota
Sioux, who had a reservation there as well as a treaty signed by the
government, considered the land sacred. General George Armstrong Custer
was sent to deal with the situation. Custer’s troops faced the combined
forces of Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne warriors and lost. Fatally.

At least in Jingo, the war is averted. But not so with the duchy of
Borogravia and its Zlobenian antagonists in Monstrous Regiment. Prince
Heinrich wants control of the duchy. Pratchett alludes to Walt Kelly’s
poignant statement with Polly Perks’s thought, We have met the enemy and
he is nice.⁵⁶ But such thoughts don’t keep her from fighting.

Agatean Empire vs. Ankh-Morpork with Rincewind on the Side

As we look at this wall—we do not want any walls of any kind between
peoples.

—Richard Nixon⁵⁷

They’re, well … foreign over there.

—Archchancellor Ridcully about the Agatean Empire⁵⁸

Diplomacy is a way of weaving the threads of two countries together.
(It’s also a way to forge powerful alliances with bigger countries with
better weaponry.) In Interesting Times, Rincewind’s enforced diplomatic
trip to the Agatean Empire (a country with some aspects of China and
Japan) in the Counterweight Continent reminded us of former president
Richard Nixon’s historic visit to the People’s Republic of China in
1972, a trip that paved the way for a new foreign policy. No other U.S.
president had visited China before. First time for everything. While we
take for granted today that anyone can visit China (we visited China
thirty years after Nixon’s trip; no albatrosses were dispatched to
encourage the visit), the fact that anyone can go there is probably due
to Nixon’s trip.

Just before that trip, then national security officer Henry Kissinger
visited Beijing. But before that, an American Ping-Pong team paved the
way for the visit—hence the “ping-pong diplomacy” designation for
Nixon’s trip.

Relations between the U.S. and China had been strained at best. But
China’s weakened alliance with Russia strengthened U.S. resolve to visit
the country. Nixon met with Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and Communist
party leader Mao Zedong. So, what did they talk about? Now that the
notes from their meetings have been declassified, we know they talked
about the Vietnam War, Taiwan (would it become independent?), and the
Chinese leaders’ fears about Japan—whether it would continue to expand.

Discworld’s Lord Hong is no Mao Zedong. Hong comes from a wealthy
family. Mao Zedong was the son of a peasant who rose to wealth. Mao
became the leader of the Red Army (now the People’s Liberation Army)—the
revolutionaries. Lord Hong wants the Red
Army—the revolutionaries of the story—to fail. But the incredibly large
Chinese Red Army, begun in 1927, has similarities not only in size but
also to the history of the PLA.

Unfortunately, Lord Hong doesn’t factor in the chaos a Rincewind and a
Cohen the Barbarian could cause. (More on chaos in chapter 3.) No one
ever does. Suffice it to say that there’s no army big enough to stop
them.

Omnians vs. The Ephebians: Jihad Discworld-style

A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people.

—Mohandas Gandhi⁵⁹

Religious wars and persecution are still other ways the threads of the
tapestry try to pull each other out. In Small Gods, Deacon Vorbis, the
Quisition head, instigates war against Ephebe and anyone else who
refuses to believe in “the right” god—Om—a god that Vorbis doesn’t
really believe in. The Islamic term “jihad”—“holy war”—immediately leaps
to mind. Vorbis also wants to persecute anyone who claims to be a
devotee of the “turtle movement”—those who believe that the world is
carried on the backs of four elephants standing on a giant turtle. In
his opinion, the very thought is ridiculous!

It’s all a matter of perspective.

You can see the similarities between the turtle movement and early
Christians who had secret signs and calls to alert or encourage one
another in times of persecution. And, of course, the Quisition is like
the Spanish Inquisition, a tribunal begun by King Ferdinand II of Aragon
and Queen Isabella I of Castile (a.k.a. the “Catholic
King and Queen”) in the fifteenth century in reaction to suspicions
concerning the conversion of Jews to Christianity. The inquisitor
general (Vorbis’s office in Small Gods) headed the Inquisition. The idea
was to maintain Catholicism in the kingdom of Castile. One way to do
this was to stamp out what inquisitors believed were heretical ideas
(i.e., Protestant beliefs) through the use of trials and torture. You’ve
probably heard the saying “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition,” a
saying popularized in a Monty Python sketch. This was because no one
knew exactly when the inquisitors would roll into town. Everything was
hush-hush.

Vorbis’s trip to Ephebe and the war that almost results also bring to
mind the Crusades, starting at the end of the eleventh century. The
Crusades were a counter-jihad of sorts fought in Palestine and Syria,
after Muslims tried to take back Christianized areas. The fighting went
on for centuries.

Sadly, we’re all well acquainted with the consequences of the jihad of
our day: war in Iraq, suicide bombings, buildings toppling in New York
on September 11, 2001, and so on, thanks to the efforts of Muslim
extremists. As a counter-jihad to the trauma of 2001, U.S. troops were
dispatched to Afghanistan beginning in 2003. It’s déjà vu all over
again.

To the Muslim, jihad isn’t just a war against a perceived enemy, it is a
duty. Think of the jihad of the Fremen led by their
Messiah—Muad’Dib/Lisan al-Gaib in Frank Herbert’s Dune (classic Dune).
As Daniel Pipes of The New York Post put it, “Jihad is thus unabashedly
offensive in nature, with the eventual goal of achieving Muslim dominion
over the entire globe.”⁶⁰

Vorbis would agree.

Males vs. Females: Gender Politics

I usually make up my mind about a man in ten seconds; and I very rarely
change it.

—Margaret Thatcher⁶¹

Another rip in the tapestry is the war between the sexes. In Equal
Rites, Pratchett addresses the issue with Eskarina’s quest to become a
wizard—a quest opposed by the wizards and even, for a time, Granny
Weatherwax. Granny pooh-poohs the notion of women using wizard’s magic
(fireballs and such) not only in Equal Rites, but also in Wintersmith.

The only women the wizards gladly admit to the hallowed halls of Unseen
University are Mrs. Whitlow the housekeeper, a woman they admit they’re
afraid of, and her staff. Occasionally Susan drops by via the rite of
AshkEnte when subbing for Death. To the wizards, women aren’t capable of
“high” magic. They’re only good for, well, womanly things like birthing
babies. Hmmm.

While the Discworld series is no Feminine Mystique, the seminal work by
Betty Friedan, it is chock-full of strong female characters trying to
overcome the limitations set for them in predominantly male
environments. In Monstrous Regiment, Polly Perks and other members of
Sergeant Jackrum’s regiment learn a hard fact of life that female dwarfs
in Discworld already know: to get ahead in a male-dominated society,
disguising one’s femininity is sadly necessary. Dee learns to play the
game of politics by acting and looking like a male dwarf. And Polly
Perks learns the value of a well-placed pair of socks, as well as a
well-aimed knee when accosted by frisky enemy troops.

There’s Conina, the daughter of Cohen the Barbarian, who may
look like a helpless female but is just as deadly as Cohen. Several
thugs in Sourcery find this out the hard way. And there’s Ptraci the
handmaid half sister of Teppic in Pyramids. Ptraci isn’t your
stereotypical happy harem girl. (See chapter 11 for other strong women
in the Discworld.)

Pratchett provides other moments of feminine enlightenment, all the
while tweaking gender stereotypes. In Thud! Sally von Humpeding, the
vampire Watchperson, tries to school Angua after seeing Angua trailing
after Carrot with puppy eyes. In turn, Sally, Angua, and Cheery
Littlebottom, the forensics recruit on the Watch, do the same for
Nobby’s girlfriend Tawneee, who is perfectly willing to stand by her …
man. (You can’t help pausing when the words “man” and “Nobby” are used
together.)

But for the ultimate in feminine enlightenment, there’s Nobby, who
dresses as a woman in Jingo and has a heart-to-heart chat with a group
of women who complain about a man. He gets so into his role, he starts
to complain about Colon’s gender stereotyping.

PATTERN II: THE MYTHOLOGY FACTOR

The designer of the cartoons for the tapestries was strongly influenced
by other works of art.

—John Williamson, The Oak King, the Holly King, and the Unicorn⁶²

Dwarfs vs. Trolls

Trolls. Dwarfs of Northern mythology, living in hills, underground in
caverns or beneath; they are represented as stumpy, misshapen,
and humpbacked, inclined to thieving, and fond of carrying off human
children and substituting their own.⁶³

 

Dwarfs. Dwarfs … generally dwelt in rocks, caves, and recesses of the
earth, were the guardians of its mineral wealth and precious stones, and
were very skillful in the working of these.⁶⁴

In Discworld, prejudice isn’t just about one human looking down on
another. Pratchett throws in other species (trolls, vampires,
werewolves, golems, and zombies) to add to the malcontent mix.

As we mentioned in chapter 1, Pratchett is strongly influenced by other
works of literature. In Discworld, he includes the good and the bad,
with his own special tweaks. With dwarfs and trolls, you find the good,
the bad, and the sometimes ugly.

In Discworld, the dwarfs and trolls are ancient enemies, a fact shown
through the Battle of Koom Valley—discussed especially in Thud!—and
their uneasy relations in Ankh-Morpork. When a dwarf is murdered, a
troll is the fall guy. But friendships between dwarfs and trolls, like
the friendship between Lance-constable Detritus and Lance-constable
Cuddy in Men at Arms, also occur, which serve as a mirror of sorts for
times in this country and others when relationships between members of
different races were deemed “shocking.”

In mythology and its fantasy offspring, trolls are considered stupid,
strong, and rarely on the side of good. Think way back to childhood when
you heard the tale of “The Three Billy Goats Gruff,” a tale from the
collection of Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. Who was the bad
guy? The troll under the bridge. Or consider The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins
and the dwarves encountered a
group of hungry but easily fooled trolls, who tried to snack on them.
And in The Lord of the Rings, trolls fought on Sauron’s side.

Discworld trolls (which, it should be noted, are huge and made of rock)
have the same “stupid and strong” reputation. They have a watchdog
committee—the Silicon Anti-Defamation League—headed by troll thug
Chrysophrase. (Watchdog organizations in our world: the NAACP, the ACLU,
the Jewish Defamation League.)

Dwarfs, on the other hand, have a better reputation, but are sometimes
seen as avaricious because of their love of silver and gold, as The
Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and other books attest. They have the
same reputation in Discworld. Exhibit A: “Gold, Gold, Gold”—a popular
dwarf song. They’re a dual-society people (Copperhead and Ankh-Morpork),
like many immigrants in America who try to assimilate into American
society while maintaining roots back home. Like the trolls, dwarfs also
have a watchdog committee—the Committee for Equal Heights.

Werewolves vs. Vampires vs. Humans

Even a man who is pure in heart … May become a wolf when the wolfbane
blooms.

—Poem from The Wolf Man⁶⁵

 

Look! It’s a black chicken! Get it!

—A hungry family, trying to catch Dracula in bat form in Love at First
Bite⁶⁶

In Underworld and Underworld: Evolution, the werewolves (lycans) and
vampires have been at war for ages. The two movies show a touch of
forbidden love in the vein of West Side Story and Romeo
and Juliet (the play that inspired West Side Story) with the
relationship between Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer
who kills werewolves, and Michael (Scott Speedman), a werewolf/vampire.
(With that combination—werewolf vs. vampire—you can’t win.) So, why the
animosity? Because werewolves are the only species vampires fear—or so
we’re told in some stories. Werewolves can kill vampires.

So is it any wonder that in Discworld, vampires and werewolves find
getting along difficult? Angua, the resident werewolf on the Watch,
can’t stand vampires and cringes at being forced to work with
Lance-constable Sally von Humpeding, the Watch’s first vampire. But
Angua’s animosity goes all the way back to life in the old
country—Uberwald, where werewolves and vampires only work with other
species when plotting misery to others they hate more.

Human animosity toward vampires is just as deeply ingrained. Few people
on the Disc are fond of vampires, as Carpe Jugulum, The Fifth Elephant,
and Thud! make abundantly clear. Vimes’s antipathy toward them, in just
about every book he’s in, shows the standard human response.

It’s the same in our world. What’s the first thing you think of when the
subject of vampires comes up? Is it a warm and cheery thought? Y’know,
I’d like a vampire to drop by for dinner someday. No matter how
appealing they might seem (e.g., Constantine in Sunshine by Robin
McKinley, Selene—Kate Beckinsale’s character in the Underworld movies,
Wesley Snipes’s hybrid vampire in the Blade movies, Angel in Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, Edward in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer), you
would still give them a wide berth, as Angua tries to give Sally, even
if they claim to hunt other vampires. After all, they can’t help looking
at you the way Hannibal Lecter looks at a human—as an entrée to go with
the fava beans.

In the past, literature and movies painted a dark picture of the
vampire. After Bram Stoker, many authors, including Stephen King
(Salem’s Lot), and screenwriters showcased these creatures of the night
as the enemy (think of From Dawn till Dusk). But nowadays, they’ve been
given a new status as angst-ridden “sexy beasts”—tortured souls just
lookin’ for love (or as Eddie Murphy in an old Saturday Night Live skit
said, “Wookin’ pa nub”) and tryin’ to survive the best way they can.
Exhibit A: Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles. Exhibit B: the Underworld
movies. Exhibit C: just about any young adult series involving vampires,
including Meyer’s Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, and Ellen Schreiber’s
Vampire Kisses. Oh, and let us not forget Christopher Moore’s books
about Jody the vampire—Exhibit D. Lastly, Exhibit E: hundreds of books
listed on Amazon about finding love with a vampire. With vampires like
these, potential victims almost beg to be bitten. (I [Linda] admit to a
partiality for Meyer’s series, thanks to strong, likable characters. But
I’d still go “Tiffany Aching” all over any who came my way—frying pan
and a good stake well done. Clang! I prefer my blood in my body, thank
you.)

And werewolves or werewolf-of-sorts movies? Consider special
effects-laden movies such as An American Werewolf in London, The Howling
(which spawned seventy-five thousand sequels—okay, a slight
exaggeration), Wolfen, Van Helsing (Kate Beckinsale again), the
Underworlds, and Brotherhood of the Wolf. (The Beast of Gevaudan in the
last movie is not really a werewolf. But this movie has the essence of
the werewolf movie.) Although we pity the victim of the werewolf’s bite
who undergoes a painful metamorphosis when the moon is full, werewolves
are portrayed as ravenous, untrustworthy creatures—just a cut above
vampires. They simply can’t help killing! While werewolves are viewed
with sympathy in Blood and Chocolate by Annette Curtis Klause, the
element of being somewhat out of control when the full moon hangs in the
sky is there.

Werewolves in Discworld are tolerated more than vampires are,
particularly on non-full-moon nights, but are not much liked. The undead
have that effect on people. Like the Underworld saga, the
forbidden love between Angua and Carrot serves as a way to bridge the
gap created by the uneasy relations between humans and the undead.

Zombies vs. Humans

I always look for an intense experience, an intense ride. There is
nothing better than a good zombie movie where you run crazy and blow at
monsters!

—Sarah Polley, actress in Dawn of the Dead (2004 version)⁶⁷

If you’ve seen Peter Jackson’s movie Braindead, George Romero on a
zombie roll (Day of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the
Dead), Re-animator, The Fog, Army of Darkness, Shaun of the Dead,
Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead (2004), or any of the score upon score
of other zombie movies out there (including the
not-really-zombies-but-still-murderous-crazies in 28 Days Later or its
sequel), you’ve seen the normal reaction to zombies (i.e., destroy
them). After all, who wants to cozy up to something homicidal and hungry
(Hannibal Lecter, anyone)?

But in Pratchett’s world, zombies are a beleaguered minority. Watchman
Reg Shoe is a self-described advocate, combating prejudice toward the
Discworld dead, while Mr. Slant takes the route of assimilation by
heading the guild of lawyers in society.

Wizard Windle Poons briefly experiences the aversion of others when he
dies and becomes a zombie in Reaper Man. But Reg’s Dead Rights group
(the Fresh Starters) are there to succor and protect him.

But then there’s Saturday, the murdered baron of Genua, who comes back
as an avenging zombie. Saturday, which is an allusion to Baron Samedi, a
voodoo figure, is the right-hand man of Mrs. Gogol,
the voodoo witch in Witches Abroad. While Saturday thirsts for
vengeance, he’s still polite about it. No chewing on humans for him! But
he will kill them if necessary.

Golems vs. Humans

Golem: I feel so guilty! I’ve mangled and maimed thirty-seven people and
I told a telemarketer I was busy when I wasn’t! I’m not a good man.

Lisa Simpson: He sure is neurotic for a monster.⁶⁸

 

We shall overcome someday.

—Lyrics adapted from a gospel song written by Charles Tindley

If you’ve played video games such as Warcraft III or Enchanted Arms,
you’ve seen golems at work and probably already know that golems are
from Jewish folklore. In one tale, Rabbi Judah Loew created a golem when
the Jews in Prague were persecuted during the nineteenth century. But
these animated beings created from clay are treated as mindless slaves
in Discworld. Hmm. You can’t help thinking about Gollum in Lord of the
Rings, who was a slave to the ring.

In Discworld, golems are given the worst tasks to do and have no rights
whatsoever—a situation reminiscent of human slavery, especially the
enslavement of African Americans in the seventeenth through the
nineteenth centuries in America. Golems are viewed as little more than
chattel—something that can be sold or destroyed at an owner’s whim. The
golems could probably hum a bar or two of “We Shall Overcome.”

Isn’t it interesting that stories of golems flourished during times of
persecution in Jewish history? While the golem has the protector role in
Jewish folklore, it has the hunting-down-the-humans-to-destroy-them role
in video games—a role not far from that of a robot or a cyborg like the
terminators of the Terminator movie series.

According to Jewish folklore, a person who had a golem was considered
wise, especially since golems were created with a sacred word attached
to their foreheads like a phylactery. The Discworld golems (Dorfl, Mr.
Pump, Anghammerad, etc.) have those sacred words, which Carrot later
uses to free Dorfl in Feet of Clay.

The golem legend might have inspired Mary Shelley to create
Frankenstein. It certainly inspired such writers as Michael Chabon (The
Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), Jorge Luis Borges, Jonathan
Stroud, and Isaac Bashevis Singer.

Banshees vs. Humans

Banshee. The domestic spirit of certain Irish or Highland Scottish
families, supposed to take an interest in its welfare, and to wait at
the death of one of the family.⁶⁹

The howl of the banshee is supposed to drive a person crazy. Maybe
that’s because the banshee’s scream is the signal that death is coming
for you. But if you’re in Discworld, perhaps the banshee’s methods won’t
drive you crazy—not if the omen comes on a slip of paper thrust under
your door by Mr. Ixolite.

Banshees, like vampires and werewolves, have their place in Discworld.
Although Mr. Gryle’s murderous actions might give them a bad name, for
the most part all’s quiet on the western front. Ixolite
is part of Reg Shoe’s Fresh Starters group, which means that for the
banshee there’s some perception of mistreatment. It’s difficult to want
someone around who screams piercingly at you. (Well, Mr. Ixolite, a shy
banshee with a speech impediment, wouldn’t.)

In folklore, banshees were of the female persuasion, since the name
means “woman of fairyland.” But if you’re an X-Men fan, you know that
the Banshee (Sean Cassidy) was male and had a piercing sonic scream.
Guess Pratchett decided to buck tradition as well, by making his
banshees male.

 

 

In a skillfully woven tapestry, you don’t notice so much the individual
threads as you notice the picture as a whole. In Discworld, no thread
seems out of place.

The Play’s the Thing

The play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.

—Hamlet, act 2, scene ii, lines 633-34

ACT I: IN WHICH WE EXAMINE SHAKESPEARE

Where There’s a Will(iam Shakespeare), There’s a Way

When you read Shakespeare, what do you think of besides descriptions
like clever or boring or memories of the fifth-period English teacher or
college prof who nauseated you? Depends on the play, right? If you read
Macbeth (“the Scottish play”—see the sidebar here) or saw it performed,
maybe you remember certain lines, especially since many of them are
quoted in fantasy books or scripts as disparate as old Star Trek (the
“classic” series) reruns or Harry Potter films. If you read Hamlet, or
even if you didn’t, you can probably recall some of the “to be or not to
be” soliloquy, since it’s quoted often. And if you read A Midsummer’s
Night Dream or saw the 1999 movie of the same name that starred
Christian Bale, Kevin Kline,
Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sophie Marceau, and Calista
Flockhart, well, who knows what you probably thought during that!

For Pratchett, reading Shakespeare was the catalyst to a Discworld plot
or some aspect of Discworld mythology. But not just Shakespeare. There’s
also Andrew Lloyd Webber (The Phantom of the Opera), Richard Wagner (the
Ring Cycle), and other composers and authors.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

Just As You Like It: A Big MacMess with a Side Order of Ham(let)

If you read Wyrd Sisters and some of the other Lancre witch novels
(Maskerade, for example), you revisited some aspects of the plot and
some of the lines of Macbeth. But not just Macbeth. There’s also a
smattering of As You Like It, one of Shakespeare’s comedies, and
Hamlet—probably his most well-known tragedy. You know—it’s the one where
Hamlet learns that his mother’s new husband, Claudius, killed Hamlet’s
father. (A therapy session just waiting to happen.)

The plot of Macbeth, in short, is this: After three witches (the weird
sisters) predict that Macbeth, thane of Glamis and lately of Cawdor,
will become king of Scotland (and that his friend Banquo will be the
father of kings), the henpecked Macbeth is encouraged by his wife to
“screw his courage to the sticking-place”⁷⁰—a line Gaston sang in Beauty
and the Beast—and murder Duncan (the king, a guest in their castle),
thus taking over the throne of Scotland. Lady Macbeth plants the daggers
on the king’s servants. But
when Macduff, yet another thane, visits and discovers the murder,
Macbeth murders the servants.

The late king’s sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee to England and Ireland
respectively and are suspected of the deed. But Macduff suspects
Macbeth. During his exile from Scotland, Macduff resolves to bring one
of the king’s sons back to rule.

Meanwhile back at the ranch, or rather, castle, Macbeth then hires two
murderers to off Banquo and his son, Fleance, who escapes. Banquo’s
ghost makes a guest appearance at Macbeth’s home. Macbeth then visits
the three witches, and hears a ghost prophesy that none of woman born
will harm him. Ha, ha! No one should ever trust that line, as the Witch
King in Return of the King could tell you. Wait. He can’t. Eowyn
finished him off, thanks to a similar prophecy.

Back to Macbeth: The witches also tell him that he’ll be defeated if
forces unite at Birnam Wood. Macbeth then sends the murderers to deal
with Macduff. But he’s not home. Just so the trip isn’t a total loss,
they murder Macduff’s family and servants.

The guilt over the murder of Duncan and subsequent crimes sends Lady
Macbeth over the edge. She later dies, undoubtedly by her own hand.

Malcolm brings forces from England to usurp the throne. During the war,
Macduff, who fights on Malcolm’s side, kills Macbeth. Before doing so,
Macduff smugly announces that he was taken from his mother’s womb
earlier than normal (possibly by Caesarean). Another prophecy is
fulfilled.

In Wyrd Sisters (an obvious play on “weird sisters” or the Fates), Duke
Felmet and his lady are, of course, the Macbeth and Lady Macbeth of the
story. By murdering King Verence, Duke Felmet usurps the throne of
Lancre. But Granny Weatherwax, Magrat Garlick, and Nanny Ogg take on the
roles of the three witches as well as of Macduff when they rescue the
king’s son (Tomjon) and try to get his throne back for him.

The duke is a little more insane and the duchess a lot less so than are
the couple in Macbeth. And Felmet’s wife is much more calculating and
vicious, with no moral guilt.

The opening line of Macbeth, spoken by the First Witch (“When shall we
three meet again?”), appears at the beginning of Maskerade and Wyrd
Sisters. (Well, in Maskerade, “we two” appear, instead of three.) The
“rule of three” witches that Granny enforces in Maskerade harks back to
Macbeth’s three witches as well as to the three archetypes of women: the
maiden, the mother, and the crone, and the three Fates in Greek
mythology—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. Three witches are deemed more
powerful together than one.

Plays written by Hwel (shades of Will?) the dwarf, a friend of Tomjon,
are parodied lines from Macbeth and As You Like It.

  All the Disc it is but an Theater, Ane alle men and wymmen are but Players.⁷²                                                                              All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely play ers. (As You Like It, act II, scene vii, lines 139-43)
  The very soil cries out at tyranny.⁷³                                                                                                                      Macduff: Bleed, bleed, poor country: Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure (Macbeth, act IV, scene iii, line 38)

The title of one of Hwel’s plays—Please Yourself—is an allusion to As
You Like It—a romantic comedy concerning love at first sight (Orlando
for Rosalind), banishment (Orlando and Rosalind again), cross-dressing
(uh, Rosalind), and betrayal (Rosalind again; just kidding—this time
it’s usurping brother Frederick against his brother, Duke Senior). Love
wins out, of course.

The duchess’s suggestion to use a play to cause the people of Lancre to
hate the witches reminds us of Hamlet’s hope that a play will “catch the
conscience” of his murderous uncle, Claudius. A more direct allusion to
Hamlet comes when Vitoller (theater manager and surrogate father of
Tomjon) says, “The pay’s the thing” but then switches to “the play’s the
thing.”⁷⁴

An earlier allusion to Hamlet (possibly) comes when Granny, Nanny, and
Magrat attend a play in the hopes of choosing a surrogate family for
Verence’s son, whom they rescued from a murderous guard. During the
play, Granny is appalled by and confused about the scene she sees—a
murder and the murderer’s speech concerning his sorrow over the murder.
Could this be an allusion to Hamlet’s murder of Polonius in act III,
scene iv of Hamlet?

Since we’re on the subject of foolish behavior, let’s move on to fools.
Even though there is a Fools and Joculators guild in Ankh-Morpork,
Verence’s profession as a fool harks back to Touchstone the fool in As
You Like It, as well as to lines spoken by Jaques, a depressed
character. A fool’s capering lightens Jaques’s mood, as he describes in
act II, scene vii. Also, the fact that Verence (or the Fool, as he is
known for much of Wyrd Sisters) constantly uses the language of the day
(“marry,” “prithee”) fits the Shakespearean mode.

A Slumber Party, Lords and Ladies

Next up in the playbill: Lords and Ladies (LL). While Pratchett’s LL is
not a parody of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Shakespeare’s tale of
erroneous match-ups among lovers, it has some similarities. Verence II,
the king of Lancre, and Magrat Garlick are on the eve of their wedding
(one that will take place on Midsummer Day), just as Duke Theseus (yes,
that Theseus—the Greek hero) and Hippolyta in Dream are. There’s even to
be a special play that takes place on Midsummer’s Eve to commemorate the
wedding of Verence and Magrat. And whaddya know—a play is held at the
wedding feast of Theseus and Hippolyta in Dream. Unlike “the story of
the Queen of the Fairies”⁷⁵ that Jason Ogg describes in LL, in Dream a
group of Athenian laborers—Quince the carpenter, Snug the joiner, Bottom
the weaver, Starveling the tailor, Snout the tinker, and Flute the
bellows-mender—perform the love story of Pyramus and Thisbe, a reference
to a story in Metamorphoses by Ovid and one that parallels the situation
with Lysander and Hermia.

Of course, we can’t help comparing the list of these laborers to the
Lancre Morris Men in LL. Pratchett mentions Carter the baker, Weaver the
thatcher, Baker the weaver, Tailor “the other weaver,” Carpenter the
poacher, Thatcher the carter, Tinker the tinker, and Jason Ogg the
blacksmith, who call themselves “Rude Mechanicals” (LL, page 140)—an
allusion to Puck’s description of the Athenian laborers in Dream: “a
crew of patches, rude mechanicals that work for bread upon Athenian
stalls.”⁷⁶

“The fair folk”—the elves/fairies or “lords and ladies” as Granny
and Nanny call them—almost ruin “the course of true love” (Dream, act I,
i, 136) with their antics, just as in Dream. In LL, the Fairy Queen’s
desire for a mortal husband (even though she already has an immortal
one) mirrors Titania’s flirting, as Oberon her King of the Fairies
husband, would attest. The Long Man, the husband of the Fairy Queen, has
to help set things right, just as Oberon has to do in Dream.

Even though he has antlers, the Long Man reminds us of Pan, the Greek
god of shepherds and flocks, who had goat horns and hooves. (If you saw
Pan’s Labyrinth, an Oscar-winning film from 2006, directed by Guillermo
del Toro, you’ve seen a portrayal of Pan.) But the name is an allusion
to the Long Man of Wilmington, the male figure carved into Windover Hill
in Sussex, England. No one knows who carved the figure, which is
outlined by painted concrete blocks. It may have been done in the
twelfth century.

And what of the elves? They are mischievous like Puck in A Midsummer
Night’s Dream. But their mischief goes beyond flinging a love potion or
giving someone a donkey’s head. We’ve more to say about that in chapter
12. They only look like Legolas and the other noble elves of Lord of the
Rings because of the glamour they cast on unsuspecting humans—the belief
that they are beautiful.

If you’re into Brian Froud at all, you know that he illustrated a number
of books on fairy creatures (Giants; Faeries, co-illustrated with Alan
Lee; Good Faeries/Bad Faeries). Pratchett’s elves would fall under the
bad faeries category. Pratchett’s Fairy Queen, like Titania, is
self-centered but less pliable than Titania. Unlike Gloriana, the fairy
queen of Edmund Spenser’s epic, The Faerie Queen, Pratchett’s queen is
iceberg-cold emotionally, colder than Hans Christian Andersen’s Snow
Queen. In The Wee Free Men, where we meet her again (first in Lords and
Ladies), she at least has some maternal instincts, as shown through her
kidnapping of children (another allusion to the Snow Queen). But she
really doesn’t understand children
and thinks nothing of ordering her elves to shoot to kill any humans who
get in her way. Can’t imagine Galadriel doing that!

Hwel the playwright makes a guest appearance in a footnote at the end of
LL with the mention of two titles for the same play: The Taming of the
Vole and Things That Happened on a Midsummer Night. We don’t have to
tell you that these titles are allusions to Shakespeare’s The Taming of
the Shrew and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Whoops. Guess we already did.

This is a great opportunity to take a ten-minute intermission. We expect
you back in your seats when the lights flash.

The Scottish Play: A Superstition

In some theatrical circles, actors perform “the Scottish play,” rather
than Macbeth. This is all due to the Macbeth superstition—the fear that
performing the play will cause horrible things to happen to the actors
or others on the set. In particular, those who even say the name of the
play or use the words of the witches’ chant (act IV, scene I) could have
an accident or die.

Rumors of terrible things that happened to theatrical companies caused
this superstition to flourish. So, how did this superstition begin?

Many companies on the wane would perform Macbeth at the end of their
season, hoping to stay in business, knowing that the crowds loved the
play. But even the ticket sales for Macbeth couldn’t keep them afloat.
So they closed, thus inspiring the fear that performing Macbeth would
cause terrible things to happen.

ACT II: IN WHICH WE EXPLORE MUSICAL THEATER

A Grand Day at the Opera

When was the last time you saw Phantom of the Opera? We’ve seen the
stage production a combined total of about seven times. Maskerade
revisits the world of the Phantom of the Opera. But Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s stage hit wouldn’t have been made had it not been for the book
written by Gaston Leroux and serialized in 1909-10. Leroux was inspired
to write books because of the well-known mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle
and Edgar Allan Poe. Although Leroux said that the inspiration for
Phantom was the Paris opera house and an accident that took place in
1896, when the counterweight of a chandelier dropped on the audience
(ouch), it also may have been inspired by Trilby, a popular novel by
George du Maurier, published in 1894. The protagonist is Trilby, a
tone-deaf young woman who can’t sing but who is hypnotized into doing so
by Svengali, a musician and mesmerist.

Leroux’s world is populated by opera ingénue Christine Daaé, her
aristocratic childhood friend Raoul, opera diva Carlotta, opera managers
Richard and Moncharmin, Madame Giry, and Erik, the misshapen “opera
ghost”/“angel of music” whose murderous antics overshadow all. A man
known as the Persian witnesses the story’s events.

Erik vows to make Christine a great opera singer if she remains in his
control and loves only him. He’s also not above extorting money from the
previous managers of the opera house and occasionally killing anyone who
gets in his way. (As a criminal, he is an overachiever.) But Raoul falls
for Christine, who reciprocates his love, which raises the ire of Erik,
who tries to coerce Christine into giving up Raoul, by first kidnapping
her and then torturing Raoul
and the Persian to rid himself of his rival. But Christine later talks
Erik into letting them go.

Opera, of course, plays a major part in the story, with the mention of
performances of Gounod’s opera Faust (based on Goethe’s epic) and Erik’s
own composition—Don Juan Triumphant.

Leroux’s book wasn’t exactly a smash hit when it hit the shelves. But a
1925 Lon Chaney movie helped it gain more attention. Other film versions
soon followed, including one in 1943 with Claude Rains and Nelson Eddy.
(We didn’t see either one.)

Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage production of Phantom, which first opened in
London in 1986, became the Phantom most people remember. As of the
writing of this book, it is the longest-running show on Broadway in
history. It spawned a movie adaptation of its own—a 2004 production
directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Webber.

Pratchett stepped into the Phantom world with Maskerade, a title that
plays on the masquerade taking place during the course of Leroux’s story
and the stage play and Poe’s story “The Masque of the Red Death”—from
which Erik’s Red Death costume in the book and musical is derived. (Got
all that? There will be a quiz later … . Just kidding.)

A Christine inhabits the Pratchett Phantom world, but so does an Agnes
Nitt, the would-be member of Granny Weatherwax’s trio of witches, whose
voice is used for Christine’s opera debut. Instead of Paris, the venue
is Ankh-Morpork. Instead of Buquet, the murdered scene-stealer in
Leroux’s story, there is Mr. Bucket, the owner of the opera house. (A
scene-stealer does make an appearance in Maskerade.) And instead of Erik
the solitary phantom, there are two opera ghosts: Walter Plinge and
Salzella, the musical director. But per Webber’s production, there is an
André. But instead of being the owner/manager of the house, he is an
undercover cop as well as a piano player.

Not content to parody the plot of Phantom, Pratchett alludes to
several operas, not to mention the one-two combo of a title like The
Joye of Snacks (Nanny Ogg’s racy cookbook), which parodies in content
and title both The Joy of Cooking and The Joy of Sex. But let’s stick
with opera.

With Discworld’s parodies, the play’s the thing and the play’s cha-ching
for Pratchett. For another musical parodied, see chapter 13. But for
now, please exit to your right. And don’t forget your playbill.

Ringside Seats

I n The Fifth Elephant, Sam, Sybil, and the rest of the diplomatic team
travel to Shmaltzberg in Uberwald and see a performance of the dwarf
opera Bloodaxe and Ironhammer. This opera, we’re told, is from the
Koboldean Cycle—a series of operas usually performed over five weeks.
Well, that’s an allusion to Richard Wagner’s opera series Der Ring des
Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)—which is about as grand as opera
can get. Many people just call it the Ring Cycle.

The four operas of the Ring Cycle are Das Rheingold, Die Walküre,
Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung. This opera series is usually shown over
four nights and takes about fifteen hours to perform. (If you’re tempted
to sneer at that, consider the fact that many people watched all three
Lord of the Rings extended editions in marathon showings at
theaters—almost twelve hours of viewing, not to mention a marathon of
all five Best Picture Oscar nominees for 2007 at AMC theaters.)

Maybe you’re not into opera as grand as that. But many fantasy writers,
including Pratchett, Tolkien, Stephen R. Donaldson, and the Wachowski
Brothers (the Matrix trilogy), were familiar with the story.

The Ring Cycle, which is based on Norse mythology, is about a magic ring
a dwarf named Alberich forged out of Rheingold stolen from the Rhine
that grants power to rule the world. (So, it’s fitting that the
Koboldean Cycle is performed by dwarfs!) Everyone who gains it has great
difficulty giving it up. Sound familiar? Wotan (Odin), the chief god,
steals the ring, thus prompting Alberich to curse it. All who obtain it
come to grief as Wotan soon finds out. (Sméagol in Lord of the Rings
found that out as well.) Siegfried—a
hero not unlike Achilles in that he’s part god, part human, with one
weakness (his back instead of his heel)—obtains it, to his doom. If you
saw Matrix Revolutions, you saw a funeral as grand as that of
Siegfried’s in Götterdämmerung.

After that, the ring finally returns from whence it came, just as the
ring in Lord of the Rings returns to Mount Doom. Kinda gets you all
choked up, doesn’t it?

Witchy Woman

Wooo hooo witchy woman, See how high she flies.

Don Henley⁷⁷

 

Witches are just plain meaner than wizards.

—Professional wizard/detective Harry Dresden in Storm Front⁷⁸

BEWITCHED

What words or images does the word “witch” conjure in your mind? (Ha ha.
Pun intended.) Bad-tempered? Evil? Scary? Warty? An image of someone
mysterious like the woman in the song above, even though that song is
really not about a witch, per se? It is one that conflicts many
people—us included. Traditionally, witches in literature have not been
viewed as positively as warlocks or sorcerers have. Think of the image
of Ged (Ursula LeGuin’s Earthsea series) or Merlin (for more on them,
see the next chapter) versus Ged’s aunt in A Wizard of Earthsea. Whereas
Ged becomes a learned man well versed in high magic, the magic-wielding
aunt walks in ignorance and battles the suspicions of others. Or think
of The Crucible, Arthur Miller’s
classic play about the Salem witch hunt, as a symbol for McCarthyism.
(Or maybe you wish to forget that.) Consider the fears, prejudices, and
ignorance of the townspeople and how the accusation of witchcraft became
a tool in the hands of manipulative individuals.

Let’s get back to image. Many of the books and movies written today have
tried to shake up the image of the witch we’re used to in fairy tales.
In the 1960s, there was Samantha Stephens, the suburban housewife/witch
played by Elizabeth Montgomery in the TV show Bewitched, which you can
still see on TV Land. You know—the one with the annoying mother, Endora,
and the mortal husband, Darrin (played by two different actors—Dick York
and Dick Sargent). Samantha made a comeback in the 2005 movie starring
Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. (Perhaps you wish to forget that, as
well.) Just before the movie Bewitched, TV shows and movies like
Charmed, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and The Craft featured younger
witches. And of course, there’s the Harry Potter book and movie series,
and Wicked—first the book, then the hit play.

As you know, witches in traditional fairy tales tend to come in oven
door-slamming sizes, ride broomsticks, have warts, and cackle. They’re
wicked (the Wicked Witches of the West and East from Oz), like to snack
on children (Baba Yaga in Russian fairy tales; the witch in “Hansel and
Gretel”), are fond of cats, and wouldn’t win any beauty contests. But
sometimes witches are beautiful, but still evil at heart, like the White
Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C. S. Lewis’s classic
tale, Morgan Le Fay in the King Arthur tales, or the queen in “Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs,” the Brothers Grimm fairy tale used in the
1937 Disney movie. The queen was also of the stepmother variety and you
know what fairy tales have to say about them. (See evil above.)

But in the Harry Potter series, Hermione Granger is one of the heroines
and doesn’t have a wart. She is fond of cats, though. And then there’s
Professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor House—a
stern but noble woman, who can turn herself into a cat, and Professor
Trelawney, who’s ditzy. In Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series,
Moiraine Damodred, Egwene al’Vere, Nynaeve al’Meara and many others are
Aei Sedai—female channelers of power—who behave heroically, but
sometimes make mistakes. None of them have warts, either. And let’s not
forget the Bene Gesserits—the witches of the Dune series. Like Jessica,
the mother of Paul (Muad’Dib), they can be manipulative. (Some would
call that assertive.) But no warts there, either.

So, what are witches like in Discworld? Well, they are …

… Powerful.

At Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is touted as the best witch of her
generation. So, what does that mean exactly? Well, she’s the smartest
girl at school, for one thing. (Well, in book 7 this aspect changed to a
degree.) Esmeralda (Granny) Weatherwax is possibly the best witch in
Discworld. In other words, she’s the Ged or Merlin of her world.
(Although we wonder if Tiffany Aching may someday eclipse her.) Her
brand of “headology” (she makes you do the work instead of her) may seem
like a bunch of hooey or psychobabble, but it helps her reserve power.
She unleashes it from time to time to help save Discworld.

She’s a borrower—but not like the Clocks in Mary Norton’s classic
children’s series The Borrowers. She can delve into the mind of an
animal. This is different from actual transformation into an animal, as
wizards such as Ged or Merlin achieve with the right word of power.
After all, Granny leaves her body behind, usually with a sign reminding
others that she’s alive.

With a troll-given name Aaoograha hoa (“She Who Must Be Avoided”—see
Maskerade—or the dwarf-given name K’ez’rek d’b’duz (“Go Around the Other
Side of the Mountain”—also in Maskerade), you know that others see her
as intimidating. (Maybe
right now, you’re thinking of “He Who Must Not Be Named”—Lord Voldemort
of the Harry Potter series. Well, Maskerade came first.) And Granny’s
good at psyching out opponents in Cripple Mr. Onion—the preferred card
game of Discworld. Only a fool would bet against her.

Imagine what being the best at something is like. (Perhaps you don’t
have to imagine—you are.) Like a gunslinger, you wait for someone to
come along and challenge your position. Only when that person comes, you
know that being the best might mean killing or being killed, severely
wounded, dethroned, or humiliated. That’s Granny’s position. When a
younger witch and a Fairy Queen challenge her in Lords and Ladies,
Granny can’t say, “No, I’d rather not, thanks.” Part of the territory of
being the best means accepting any challenge. This is Jason Ogg’s
position, as well (see chapter 14).

Pratchett goes into great detail about Granny in his Discworld fact
books, so let’s move on to Nanny Ogg. While Gytha (Nanny) Ogg may act as
Granny’s sidekick, she’s not really an Avis to Granny’s Hertz. After
all, Nanny helps turn back time in Wyrd Sisters . She also delivers the
offspring of the personification of Time and Wen the Eternally Surprised
(Thief of Time). Anyone who is always there to help save the world is
pretty powerful in our opinion. And she’s as jolly as the Spirit of
Christmas Present in Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. In her home, her word
is law. Just ask her daughters-in-law.

Tiffany, Magrat Garlick, and Agnes Nitt—young and upcoming witches
(well, Magrat is a queen now)—don’t exactly fit the Charmed school of
young witches model, although they have the potential for just as much
angst. The young witches are constantly engaged in the old-school versus
new-school conflict. As you know, Magrat continually butts heads with
Granny Weatherwax, who feels that Magrat’s clothes and ideas of how to
use magic are weird. Magrat’s sort of a flower child/sucker for
supernatural paraphernalia that Granny is
quick to dismiss. And Tiffany and Agnes have moments, brought about
through Granny’s manipulation, which they live to regret. Yet Granny
seems to see vast potential in Tiffany. And no wonder. Tiffany is
possibly the most powerful of her peers, who include Petulia Gristle,
Annagramma Hawkin, Lucy Warbeck, and Dimity Hubbub.

… Hardworking and Helpful.

Tiffany, the “big wee hag”—a moniker given to her by the Nac Mac Feegles
in The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith, and a fourth book
Pratchett proposed writing, tentatively called I Shall Wear Midnight (as
of this printing, that book has not yet been published)—is a hard
worker, no question about that. She comes from a farming community of
hard workers. She makes cheese, milks cows and goats, delivers babies,
and apprentices herself to the witches of the land to do more of the
same.

As Pratchett mentioned at a book signing in Naperville, Illinois, in
October 2006, Tiffany’s miniseries is based on words and hard work.
Tiffany, Granny, Nanny, Petulia Gristle (the pig witch), and others
exemplify this.

Okay, milking a cow or making cheese may not seem as impressive as
calling down lightning or shooting fireballs at people. But somebody’s
gotta do it.

In all of the Lancre witch/Tiffany Aching miniseries, Discworld or some
unfortunate individual needs saving from some threat: vampires (Carpe
Jugulum) , a “phantom” killer (Maskerade), an evil tyrant (Wyrd Sisters)
, a crazed fairy godmother (Witches Abroad), “Them” (Equal Rites) , the
Fairy Queen and her elves (Lords and Ladies, The Wee Free Men) , the
hiver (A Hat Full of Sky) , or endless winter (Wintersmith) . Then, like
true fairy godmothers or like Glinda the Good (the Witch of the North in
Oz), Granny, Nanny, Magrat, and Tiffany come to the rescue.

Not all of the Discworld witches are helpful. (Annagramma Hawkin,
anyone?) There are more than a few bad apples, à la those in Oz,
Earthsea, and other places.

… Followers of Tradition to a Degree.

As we mentioned in chapter 5, Granny and Nanny are firm believers in the
rule of three, which was also enforced on the show Charmed. But some
witches, like Lily Weatherwax, Granny’s sister, follow tradition to the
detriment of others.

Mercedes Lackey calls the storytelling traditions inherent in fairy
tales “The Tradition” in her Five Hundred Kingdoms series, which begins
with The Fairy Godmother, a story about a Cinderella type (Elena) who
seeks to buck tradition and avoid a disastrous marriage by becoming a
fairy godmother. (Thinking about Witches Abroad right now?) The
Tradition—the magical force that propels heroes and heroines alike down
a traditional path laid out in other fairy tales—wars against Elena’s
plans. Lily Weatherwax, had she been present, would’ve forced Elena
toward her Cinderella destiny, no matter how ugly that destiny seemed.
After all, that’s what Lily does in Witches Abroad.

As we said in chapter 1, writers and compilers like the Brothers Grimm,
Andrew Lang, Hans Christian Andersen, and others helped shape the
tradition by the stories they included in their collections. But
Pratchett tweaks tradition to fit his story.

… Odd.

In a series like Discworld, you’ve got to expect a few, well, oddities.
How else can you explain a Mrs. Evadne Cake, a medium with precognition
she can turn off and on, or a Eumenides Treason (“Myth Treason” to
Tiffany) with her Boffo skulls and seeing-eye mouse (Wintersmith )? But
every witch has an odd streak in a Pratchett-written
series—even Magrat Garlick, who thinks she’s normal, but … isn’t. She’s
slightly “Luna Lovegood” (Harry Potter series; note that Magrat came
first as a character)—the odd one even in an odd bunch. Or Agnes Nitt,
the young witch with the marvelous singing voice and a split personality
(Perdita—the thin witch inside the heavier witch). Or what about Granny,
who is as ornery at times as Granny from the 1960s TV series The Beverly
Hillbillies? Although they’re odd, they’re never boring.

These aren’t your witches striving to blend in to avoid being burned at
the stake. (Well, they probably want to avoid that.) Unlike Samantha
Stephens, who wanted to get along with nosy Mrs. Kravitz and fit into
the neighborhood, Discworld witches revel in their oddities. In fact,
witches like Miss Treason deliberately try to fit the notion of the odd
witch by going the extra mile—hence the mail-order skulls and stick-on
warts. See? Odd.

… Noncacklers (Hopefully).

In Discworld, cackling is a sign of cracking, something akin to going to
the Dark Side in the Star Wars series. No witch in her right mind
(literally) would cackle. Black Aliss—the greatest witch, in Granny’s
opinion—cackled. Although she was the first to turn back time, she wound
up over the edge.

Black Aliss, who went the way of the witch from Hansel and Gretel—shut
up in an oven by two kids—is an allusion to Black Annis, the witch from
the folklore of Leicestershire. A witch with a diet consisting of
children is a sure sign of the cackler. That, and building gingerbread
houses. Of course, a witch could go for the house-on-chicken-legs
model—another sign of the cackler—à la Baba Yaga, the witch in Russian
folktales. Mrs. Gogol, the voodoo witch in Witches Abroad, favored a hut
on duck feet—a parody of Baba Yaga. That just shows you where Mrs. Gogol
stood on the cackling front. (Crossing the border into Cackle Town.)

… Alone by Choice.

Ged’s aunt in A Wizard of Earthsea lived alone—a product of the
suspicions of others and the need for privacy when one practiced magic.
Granny Weatherwax has her mountain cottage and soup for one. And
although Nanny Ogg has a home with hot and cold running sons and
daughters-in-laws popping in for visits, basically, it’s just her and
her cat, Greebo.

Witches tend to be loners, occasionally getting together with other
witches to make up the rule of three or to train someone. Even someone
in a family like Tiffany is still alone—that is, forced into a position
of authority that makes her feel alone, as we learn in Wintersmith.

As Galadriel explained to Frodo in the film based on The Fellowship of
the Ring, “You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to
be alone.”⁷⁹ Bearing the mantle of power is to be alone.

In Wyrd Sisters, we’re told that witches aren’t managed by someone who
considers herself “head witch.” In other words, there is no
archchancellor for witches. There’s just an unofficial understanding
that Granny Weatherwax is in charge. It’s lonely at the top.

… Usually Not Wizards.

You might think that goes without saying, but in Discworld, there are
some exceptions. We talked about Eskarina in other chapters. Mrs. Letice
Earwig, Granny Weatherwax’s rival in Wintersmith, uses wizard
magic—behavior of which Granny disapproves as she explains in Equal
Rites.

Is there a so-called “women’s magic”? As we mentioned in chapter 4,
wizards consider witches incapable of high magic and look disparagingly
at the “womanly” art of hedge witchery. (They’re only
fooling themselves.) So in Discworld, the magic usage seems to be a
point of division between the sexes. Yet someone like Idalia from the
Obsidian Trilogy (Mercedes Lackey) is called a “mage” (a “wild-mage,” to
be exact), rather than a witch. She performs the same kind of magic that
a male mage does and seems to be one of the best in the land. Hermione
also performs the same magic that Harry or Ron does. But she’s
considered a witch. It’s a matter of semantics.

… Not Religious.

Faith is the hallmark of a religion. If you don’t believe, what’s the
point? Pratchett has said in more than one book that the witches aren’t
believers in the gods. (See, for example, page 15 of the paperback
edition of Witches Abroad.) This is because they can see the gods and
elementals at times and aren’t very impressed by what they see, kind of
like how we feel whenever we read stories from Greek mythology. For
example, Tiffany sees Anoia—the goddess of things that get stuck in
drawers—in Wintersmith and is less than awed. And she, of course, is
wooed by the Wintersmith, whom she discovers has a major screw loose,
but who at least is on the hot side when he takes on human flesh. Still,
being a hottie does not automatically gain one worship and respect in
the witches’ book.

Witches see Death every now and then, especially since they’re the ones
who watch over the dead on the first night after death. Like the
wizards, they know when they’re going to die, which takes away some of
Death’s mystique.

While the witches’ lack of faith in the gods might seem like a
paradox—how can you not believe in something you can see?—it really
isn’t, if you think about having faith or trust in someone. You wouldn’t
put your trust in someone who has proven to be unfaithful or uncaring.
And many of the gods and elementals of Discworld are untrustworthy,
petty, vain, and just plain weird. The witches even see Death in “You’re
the Man keeping us down” terms.

Since the gods and personifications (more on them in chapter 9) behave
so predictably—and illogically—at times, the witches feel they’re the
last resort for humanity. Remember in Mort, when Death says, “There’s
just me,” in response to Mort’s statement, “There is no justice”?⁸⁰
That’s how the witches feel 24/7. Consider the fact that Tiffany has to
save the people of the Chalk time and time again. And Granny and Nanny
are always in the Save the World queue. A woman’s work is never done.

… Shepherdesses.

Although Tiffany’s grandmother (Sarah Aching) was considered a
shepherdess by trade, rather than a witch, she not only watched her
flock, she shepherded the land as well. Tiffany has inherited the
instinct for shepherding—or safeguarding—the land and the lambs,
especially the “strays” Wentworth and Roland de Chumsfanleigh (the
baron’s son), who are captured by the Fairy Queen in The Wee Free Men.

Granny, Nanny, and others have their own particular flocks—the people in
the villages for whom they provide medicine or deliver babies and
perform whatever task needs doing. This also includes shepherding their
peers. When a witch looks as if she’s ready to cackle, another witch has
the obligation to check on her.

Another way a witch acts as a shepherdess is by finding other witches
and keeping them from harm. That’s the job of Miss Perspicacia Tick, the
witch finder in The Wee Free Men. She’s like a talent agent, in a way.
She discovers Tiffany and later introduces her to Miss Level in A Hat
Full of Sky. Miss Tick also is the writer of Magavenatio Obtusis (Witch
Hunting for Dumb People), a book she slips into the town of Dogbend
(page 39 of Wintersmith—the hardcover edition) to prevent the town from
harming witches. This brings to mind yet another point. Witches are …

… Teachers of One Another.

There is no Unseen University (see next chapter) for witches. Yes, we
know that, in The Wee Free Men, Miss Tick tells Tiffany to open her eyes
and see the school for witches. But she is speaking metaphorically, as
Tiffany is quick to guess. Life is the great teacher witches depend
upon. But mainly there’s the community of witches from which to learn.

Tiffany, Magrat, and Agnes all had the benefit of hanging with Granny
and Nanny and learning from them or, in some cases, in spite of them.
Tiffany’s first teacher, however, was Miss Tick. In turn, Tiffany helps
Annagramma in Wintersmith and encourages other young witches to do so
when Annagramma gains Miss Treason’s cottage.

 

 

Discworld might not have the shiny linoleum of suburbia embodied in
Charmed or Bewitched. But it has what those shows don’t have: a
community of magic practitioners whose exploits will entertain you
without fear of cancellation.

Wise Women

If you read fantasy or medieval fiction a lot, you’ve probably come
across a wise woman or two. By this, we don’t mean strictly female
versions of King Solomon, although women bearing this title (wise woman)
know a thing or two. We mean witte wieven, as they are called in Dutch
folklore or “wise women”—the village herbalists and mystics others
sometimes seek for prophecies or fortune telling.
They’re the ones to go to for potions or charms. Some might call them
witches (specifically white witches) or hags or even the village
“wisdom” as Nynaeve is called in Eye of the World by Robert Jordan.

With their knowledge of herbs, midwifery skills, and just plain common
sense, Pratchett’s witches seem to follow the wise woman tradition in
folklore. They are like the powerful woman Princess Irene calls
Grandmother in George MacDonald’s The Princess and the Goblin and The
Princess and Curdie and, of course, the wise woman in his novella The
Wise Woman—a woman who lived alone and knew just what to do in order to
tame a spoiled princess. (We can only imagine what Granny Weatherwax
would’ve done with her!)

Being “the wise woman” isn’t without hazards. In Good Omens, a book
Pratchett coauthored with Neil Gaiman, a seventeenth-century witch,
Agnes Nutter, who makes Nostradamus-like prophecies, is burned at the
stake. While we may read the book and laugh, no one was laughing during
the Salem witch trials back in 1692, when twenty people were put to
death. Consider also the case of Bessie Dunlop, a midwife living in
Dalry, Scotland, who was burned at the stake in 1576 after being charged
with witchcraft. Although she was a real person, a number of stories
associated with her life may be fact or fiction. One story is that,
before she died, she was told to denounce her faith in God and admit
that she served the devil. She did neither. A wise woman, indeed.

WHO’S GOT THE POWER?

When was the first time you saw a magician? When you were a little kid,
sitting wide-eyed with wonder while your older brother pulled a quarter
out of your ear, thanks to his magic tricks book? When you were an older
kid, sitting bored while the Great Lame-O the Magician, who had all the
charisma of a soft-boiled egg, failed miserably at performing (and
groused about his soul-destroying job)? Or was it just last year in
Vegas, watching the latest magic debunker who explained how all the
other magicians did their tricks?

Sooner or later, you discover that while Penn and Teller, David Blaine,
David Copperfield, Houdini, the wizard in The Wizard of
Oz, or Borden and Angier—the rival wizards in Christopher Nolan’s movie,
The Prestige—are wizards at the sleight of hand,
now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t trick, they aren’t … well … real wizards
(Well, Angier had that weird Tesla-designed box … . )—the kind that lob
fireballs at people and wear pointed hats.

Maybe you’re thinking about Rincewind right about now … .

Many writers have written about wizards—no doubt inspired by the legends
of Merlin (also known as Myrddin) the magician, King Arthur’s
teacher-wizard as rendered by Geoffrey of Monmouth and T. H. White (who
favored the Merlyn spelling) in The Once and Future King and The Book of
Merlyn; or Gandalf the Grey-turned-White wizard of The Lord of the Rings
trilogy, J. R. R. Tolkien’s baby. These are your über-wizards: powerful,
self-sacrificing, wise, cranky old men—at least in appearance. (Well,
they’ve been known to laugh every now and then.) Their powers go far
beyond pulling a quarter out of someone’s ear or making the Statue of
Liberty “disappear.” These are the kinds of wizards who put monarchs on
thrones and help change the world.

Whether you call them wizards, sorcerers, male Aei Sedai (channelers),
spell weavers, chanters, mages, magicians (a vast cut above Lame-O),
thaumaturgists, dragon riders, or blacksmiths (see chapter 14) , these
power wielders come in all shapes and sizes these days. You could easily
name several dozen without breaking a sweat. There are Harry Potter, Ron
Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, the evil Lord Voldemort, and many others from
the Harry Potter series. Pug conDoin (Milamber), Kulgan, Macros the
Black, and other magicians populate Raymond Feist’s Riftwar series.
Ged/Sparrowhawk, the mage turned archmage; Ogion, his former master; and
many others appear in Ursula LeGuin’s Earthsea series. Then there are
First Wizard Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander (Zedd) and his grandson Richard Rahl
(a war wizard) in Terry Goodkind’s Sword of Truth series; Rand al’Thor
(the Dragon Reborn) and others of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series;
the dapper Jonathan Strange and fussy
little Mr. Norrell of Susanna Clarke’s novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr.
Norrell; Darrow, of Kate Constable’s Chanters of Tremaris trilogy; the
elemental wizards of Mercedes Lackey’s Elemental Masters series and
Kellen the Knight-Mage of the Obsidian Trilogy (written with James
Mallory); Harry Dresden, the wizard detective created by Jim Butcher;
dragon-riders Brom and Eragon in Eragon; the fake wizard turned real
wizard Schmendrick in The Last Unicorn (Peter S. Beagle)—the list goes
on and on and on.

In Discworld, there’s a difference between wizards, magicians,
conjurers, and thaumaturgists. Magicians are those who flunked out of
Unseen University but at least they aren’t conjurers or
thaumaturgists—the lowest form of magic practitioner, a person lacking
an education. Proper wizards earn their degrees from Unseen University.

In terms of wise, heroic wizards, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the
wisest/most heroic), many of Pratchett’s denizens of Unseen University
would probably rank a 2 at best, with Merlin, Gandalf, Ged, Dumbledore,
and many of the others mentioned above solidly at the 10 spot. (Okay,
maybe we’d give Ridcully and the Librarian a 5 or 6 for effort.)
Pratchett’s wizards are at the college don end of the spectrum—more apt
to wield a knife and fork than a staff in action. It’s not that they’re
powerless, they’re just … well … hungry.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

THE LOOK THAT SAYS “WIZZARD”

On a number of occasions, Granny Weatherwax and other witches mention
that a witch’s hat earns a witch respect. But what about the wizards? Is
there a look that screams “wizard” (or in Rincewind’s
case—“wizzard”)? When you think of the archetypal look of a wizard,
perhaps you immediately think of Gandalf, Merlin, or the wizard in The
Sorcerer’s Apprentice (whose score, L’apprenti sorcier, a scherzo by
Paul Dukas, was based on a story by Goethe) as animated in Fantasia. The
Sorcerer’s Apprentice wizard had your typical blue robe and the tall,
pointed blue hat with moons and stars. Merlin also favored the tall,
pointed hat and a robe with zodiac symbols, fur tippets, and owl
droppings. A nice look for spring. Gandalf, not to be left out, wore a
similar hat, a gray robe (until he became Gandalf the White), and a
dashing silver scarf. Ooo-la-la. And of course there’s the beard—white
or gray—and the all-important staff—the medium through which power
flows. (Wands are used in the Harry Potter series. Harry Dresden uses a
wand and a staff.)

Pratchett’s wizards are the equal of other wizards of fiction in fashion
sense. They’ve got the beards, the pointed hats, the flowing robes, and
the staffs. But Rincewind, a wizard wannabe, has a scraggly beard, a
ragged robe, and a hat with the word “wizzard” on it. Not the kind of
outfit that makes the best-dressed list or inspires confidence in
Rincewind’s abilities.

Evil wizards such as Abrim, the grand vizier in Sourcery, favor the
turban-with-a-tiny-fez look set off with a thin moustache—a look Jafar
rocked in Disney’s Aladdin movies (Aladdin; Return of Jafar).

Another look that says “wizard” is the stuffed alligator, described by
Quoth the Raven in Soul Music. Igneous Cutwell, a wizard with whom
Death’s one-time apprentice Mort has some dealings, also has one hanging
from the ceiling of his shop. This brings to mind a story by L. Frank
Baum called “The Stuffed Alligator,” published in 1905. It concerns the
capture, stuffing, and display of a young, disobedient alligator and how
his mother rescues him through the aid of the Red-Eyed One, an alligator
magician.

HEAD OF THE CLASS

Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork is to the Discworld series what
Hogwarts is to the Harry Potter series; what the School of Wizardry on
Roke is to the Earthsea series; what the City of Magicians on Kelewan
and Pug’s academy on Macros’s island are to the Riftwar series; and what
the Mage College of Armethalieh is to the Obsidian Trilogy—the place
where magic is studied and taught. Hogwarts has its headmaster, the
School of Wizardry on Roke its Arch-Mage, and Armethalieh its High
Mage—the one who really runs the city. The three are considered the top
wizards of their worlds. But in Unseen University, a place compared to
the castle of Gormenghast (from the series written by Mervyn Peake), the
archchancellor rules the roost.

The archchancellor supposedly is the leader of all of the wizards
throughout Discworld, just as the Arch-Mage is the leader of all high
mages in Armetheliah and was handpicked by the gods but elected by his
fellow wizards. (Go figure.)

Who is like Mustrum Ridcully, who assumes the position in Moving
Pictures? While not as kindly as Albus Dumbledore, he’s big on charm.
He’s like Fellowship of the Ring’s Radagast in color (Ridcully the
Brown), but unlike Radagast in that he yells at birds rather than
befriends them, and hunts them with his hunting dragons. And he’s like
Saruman, but only in rank (the leader of the wizards). Bluff,
blustering, and outdoorsy, Ridcully, a seventh-level wizard (out of
eight levels), isn’t the usual sort to hang around Unseen University. He
attains the position for that simple fact. (The old archchancellor,
Galder Weatherwax, an eighth-level wizard, disappears in The Light
Fantastic.) He’s also incredibly cheap, as he cheerfully withholds
office supplies from the staff. And in his youth, he wanted to marry
Granny Weatherwax!

Coin, a child sourcerer (an obvious wordplay on “sorcerer”) in
Sourcery, briefly rules Unseen University and Ankh-Morpork, thanks to
the plan of his crazy, vengeful father, Ipslore the Red. Since Coin is
the eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son, he is a “wizard
squared,” according to Pratchett, and therefore a source of magic,
rather than just a practitioner of magic. Drum Billet, the old wizard in
Equal Rites, expects Eskarina to be an eighth son of an eighth son. This
is a parody of the seventh-son-of-the-seventh-son aspect of mythology.
You know—the seventh son is the wizard, the hero, a healer, or has some
other unusual fate in folktales. Seven is believed to be a special
number. So why eight here? Eight is an extremely important number in
Discworld. Consider the eight great spells; octarine, the color of magic
and the eighth color of the rimbow (Discworld’s version of a rainbow);
the octograms wizards use—the list goes on and on.

A FEW GOOD … MEN?

Discworld has its share of eccentric wizards (almost a redundancy). We
know many of the wizards of Unseen University by their titles, rather
than their names. There’s the Senior Wrangler, the Lecturer in Recent
Runes, the Dean, the Chair of Indefinite Studies, Dean of Pentacles, and
so on. But then there’s Rincewind, who for a time has only one spell
firmly anchored to his brain. He can’t do magic to save his life.

And what of Unseen University’s Librarian? Although he is currently an
orangutan, he was once a human who was magically transformed into an
orangutan. And no, he does not wear a pointed hat. With Pratchett
committed to the fight to save orangutans, is there any wonder that the
Librarian chose to remain an orangutan rather than return to being
human?

It’s only fitting that we again mention Eskarina, who invades the boys’
club of wizardry by becoming Discworld’s first female wizard.
Of course, Granny Weatherwax could have had that honor, had she been
allowed to attend Unseen University in her younger days.

THE STUDENT CENTER

It stands to reason that a place of learning has to have students. And a
wizard is always in the process of learning. But they had to start
somewhere. For many, the road from apprenticeship to mastery is
unending. Maybe that’s why many of Discworld’s wizards are really old.
Ponder Stibbons, a former graduate student-turned-head of Inadvisably
Applied Magic, is one of the youngest wizards on staff. But there are
students like Victor Tugelbend (Moving Pictures ), who has the ability
but lacks the drive to be a wizard, and Mr. Sideney (Hogfather), who
lacks a moral compass and winds up in trouble for his part in the
Hogfather escapade. They’re about as far from true mastery as toast is
from being an apple. Small wonder since the risk of death for wizards is
far higher than for nonwizards.

Ged, Harry, Ron, Pug—we watch each on his road toward mastery. But does
a wizard ever fully master his profession? Probably not. The wizards on
Discworld keep learning one important lesson—how to stay alive.

A WIZARD’S JOB IS NEVER DONE

In The Prestige, the magicians always searched for the next trick—the
one that would truly amaze an audience as well as catapult the magician
to fame. Making the next discovery was their great work, like that of
any scientist. But a wizard’s great work seems to consist of putting the
right person on the throne (a job for witches in Discworld), stopping
evil wherever it may arise (as a knight would), and then fading away
with the passage of time. Merlin, Ged, and
Gandalf accepted the fading aspect of life. Discworld wizards accept
this insofar as they know when they’re going to die. But as for putting
the right person on the throne and other civic duties, well, they’d
rather not get involved because doing so somehow always involves taxes.
We can’t blame them.

For some wizards, their great work is to find out what they’re really
made of. Schmendrick, in The Last Unicorn, didn’t know he could work
magic until he joined the unicorn’s quest. And Harry Potter’s
soul-destroying life with the Dursleys proved to be the launching pad
that gave Harry the resiliency he would later need in the fight against
You-Know-Who. But what of Rincewind? Unlike self-doubting Schmendrick,
he never comes to a place where he can work magic on his own. Yes, he
works some in Eric—or at least seems to. But he was manipulated by a
demon. And he works magic to a degree in Sourcery, but that’s all due to
the incredible amount of magic in the air because of the rule of
sourcery. So, for Rincewind, his great work is remaining alive.

Some mundane tasks that a wizard handles might seem extraordinary to us.
Wizards also are known for working the weather—stoking a breeze or
blowing a cloud over the right place. Zedd, Ged, and many of the other
mages of Earthsea were skilled weather workers. Even the wizards of
Discworld accept this task as part of wizardry, but only act upon it
when necessary. Teaching classes at Unseen University is another task
they act upon only when necessary. But they are quick to lob a fireball
at someone or something. They’re trigger-happy.

For the wizard, words are of supreme importance—no matter what the task.
Knowing the right words gives the wizard control. This is the lesson
Brom taught Eragon in Eragon. This is what Ged learned in A Wizard of
Earthsea. The Discworld wizards, too, are expected to have mastered the
languages needed to cast spells—although they sometimes argue about
those words.

MAGE WARS ROCK THE HOUSE

With all of that power, there are bound to be some egos and evil among
wizardkind. Just about every world with wizards goes through mage wars,
as writers like Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, J. K. Rowling, Mercedes
Lackey, and others attest. If you read any of their series, you know
that these wars are sometimes triggered by evil wizards (or those with
seriously confused priorities) bent on world domination. A small band of
plucky heroes unsure of their own powers is there to try to stop them,
even if they wind up sacrificing their lives in the process. In the
Harry Potter series, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and other wizards
are on the side of good against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In Debt
of Bones, it’s Zedd versus the evil Panis Rahl and, in Wizard’s First
Rule, Zedd and Richard square off against Darken Rahl. In The Farthest
Shore, Ged is pitted against Cob, a wizard who just happens to be dead.
In the Obsidian Trilogy, the war is between the human and elf mages (not
that there are many of the latter) on the one side and the evil
Endarkened mages. Although mage wars can sometimes foster wars between
humans and other beings, the emphasis in a mage war is on those who
wield the power.

Sourcery describes the mage war in Discworld that results when the
archchancellor’s stolen hat is worn by the evil Abrim. Wizard egos get
in the way of Ipslore and Abrim’s twin quests for world domination.
(More on the villain’s quest in chapter 12.) Of course, Rincewind is in
the thick of things (he usually is) and the world nearly ends—par for
the course in Discworld and for the life of a wizard.

Top Gun

Who would win in a mage contest between the wizards of fiction? Take a
look at the stats below. ⁸³

[e9781429934886_i0026.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0027.jpg]

 ⁸⁴

In a contest of sheer power, it’s hard to say who would win since all
are considered the leaders of wizards. Coin has an edge simply because
his powers are akin to the gods of Discworld and because he was able to
trap the gods in a ball of thought. As Pratchett describes it, Coin’s
too powerful even to remain in Discworld. Yet he’s human and probably
could be killed, although we’re not sure how.

Ridcully is the dark horse. There are advantages and disadvantages to
his mage supremacy. Advantages: (1) He’s difficult to kill. Ask anyone
who wants his job as archchancellor. (2) He would probably fight dirty.
(3) He became a seventh-level wizard at an early age. Disadvantages: (1)
He’d probably rather spend his time hunting than perfecting his art. (2)
He didn’t attain the eighth level (probably out of self-preservation).
(3) We’re not entirely positive that he could beat any of the other
wizards in the chart, especially the sourcerer (okay, we know he can’t
beat Coin). (4) We seriously doubt that he’d care, unless a fellow mage
trespassed on Ridcully’s property or took his Wow-Wow sauce.

Raymond Feist wrote a number of books on Pug, so you know how formidable
an opponent he is. Could he beat Ridcully or Coin? Hmmm. The jury’s
still out, especially since Pug’s powers are akin to the gods’. Since
Tolkien and T. H. White focused on the horrors and sadness of war,
rather than testosterone posturing among wizards, we can’t know the full
extent of the powers of Merlin or Gandalf. Merlin’s part human and part,
well, other, thanks to being the son of an incubus and a human. (There’s
no Hallmark card for that.) But Gandalf is Maiar—a spirit being like an
angel, according to Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. And as for Dumbledore,
well, you know what happened to him in book 6.

The Reaper Man

The Death of the Disc was a traditionalist who prided himself on his
personal service and spent most of the time being depressed because this
was not appreciated. He would point out that no one feared death itself,
just pain and separation and oblivion, and that it was quite
unreasonable to take against someone just because he had empty eye
sockets and a quiet pride in his work.⁸⁵

 

Dying is a very dull, dreary affair. And my advice to you is to have
nothing whatever to do with it.

—W. Somerset Maugham⁸⁶

A PERSONIFICATION TO REMEMBER

Many would agree with us that Death is one of the most loved characters
of Pratchett’s Discworld. The inevitable mortality of us makes the idea
of death scary, but we have a fascination with Pratchett’s quirky
representation. This personification of death⁸⁷ is a seven-foot-tall
skeletal man dressed in a black robe, with a scythe, who speaks in
capital letters (more on this later). Readers are enamored
with him, because of his endearing personality and his love of cats,
among other things. He is the kind of guy you can sit down with and have
tea, as he does with Miss Flitworth in Reaper Man. (Actually, we recall
that being a quite uncomfortable situation.) Or you may want to play a
game with him in his room of lifetimers with the guys (you know, War,
Pestilence, and Famine—more on them in chapter 9) . It is not uncommon
to see Death at the gentlemen’s club called Fidgett’s. At times he is
sympathetic, sentimental, and oftentimes he is humorous (not on
purpose). After all, he is not the one who takes a person’s life—just
the one who picks up the dead.

Pratchett books are different from many other fantasy or science fiction
stories in that he throws in enough death to make it clear that good
doesn’t always win. This creates the need for a character like Death
because of the amount of souls in need of a pickup. He could have left
it at that—you know, the clown⁸⁸ is hit over the head by the ferocious
werewolf and dies from a brain aneurysm, then continue on with the
story—but typically an appearance of the character Death is in order.
And eventually everyone meets Death.

Death has been around on the Disc since the first book of the Discworld
series in 1983: The Color of Magic. He makes his appearances in almost
all Discworld books, with the exception of Wee Free Men, but the major
Death-themed books are Mort, Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather, and
Thief of Time. Even though Death appears in earlier books, Mort is the
one in which his character is truly developed.

In Reaper Man, it is explained that Death was created by belief, just as
were all the gods of the Disc. “He evolved, as it were, along with life.
As soon as a living thing was even dimly aware of the concept of
suddenly becoming a non-living thing, there was Death. He was Death long
before humans ever considered him; they only
added the shape and all the scythe and robe business to a personality
that was already millions of years old.”⁸⁹ He is one of the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Death is not limited by time and space. He
has no need to sleep, and knows everything⁹⁰

OTHER PORTRAYALS OF DEATH

Humans have been fascinated and fearful of death since the beginning of
time, well, the beginning of mankind. It is only natural that we have
personified Death into a skeletal form holding a scythe; after all, the
Romans personified Genius by depicting a man holding a cornucopia.

A medieval painting depicts Death as playing chess with a man (more on
games with Death later). Death seems to be holding the chessboard on his
lap, and both Death and the man appear to have smiles.

Martine Leavitt wrote the book Keturah and Lord Death, which portrays
Death uniquely as a young man who is the collector of souls. He is in
love with the girl Keturah, who persuades him to let her live for just
one more day (this happens multiple times) by telling him stories but
not revealing the end. She must search out a love superior to death, to
be granted life. Keturah alone is able to see Death and therefore knows
when someone near her is about to be collected by him.

Death Takes a Holiday is a romantic 1934 film about a personified Death
who spends time on earth in hopes of understanding why humans fear him.
He takes the form of a human named Prince Sirki. While taking a vacation
from his job, he finds one who does not fear him and falls in love with
her. While Death is on holiday, people
and other living things stop dying. Meet Joe Black, a 1998 loose remake
of Death Takes a Holiday, is similar in storyline, but was much less
well received and twice as long.

In Neil Gaiman’s Sandman graphic novels, Death is a gothic young female
who finds humans interesting and enlightening. Ironically, she is
described as a joyful character, and she is able to cheer up her
brother, Dream, in the first volume of the series (for more on that, see
chapter 9). Neil Gaiman also has a portrayal of Death (Azrael) in the
book Good Omens, which he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett.

BINKY, DEATH’S STEED

Since Death is one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, it is only
appropriate that in Discworld he should have his own horse. Two horses
shortly filled this order, but failed, due to too much limb repair (the
skeletal steed) and too many fire hazards (the fiery steed torched the
barn). Death then settled on a horse named Binky. His granddaughter,
Susan, was so fond of Binky that he gave her a toy set of “My Little
Binky” as a birthday present. Binky is a fantastic horse who walks on
his own devised ground (he defies gravity; you may want to think of it
as flying but it’s not). Binky obliges Death by coming to him whenever
he snaps his fingers and makes sure a rider doesn’t fall off when riding
him. Binky is just as obedient to Susan as he is for Death.

Binky is cared for well at Death’s Domain. He wears a silver harness.
The blacksmith Jason Ogg, whom Death considers “superb” at his job,
makes horseshoes for Binky. Jason Ogg is the oldest son of Nanny Ogg and
the blacksmith of Lancre. (For more about Jason, see chapter 14.)

A FAMILY MAN

Death decides to start a family because he wants to know what it’s like
to be human. He adopts Ysabell as a baby, upon the death of
her parents. Ysabell’s daddy (Death) allows her to grow to be sixteen
years old with the misconception that teenagers are easier to care for
than young children are.⁹¹ Housed in Death’s Domain where there is no
aging, Ysabell remains a teenager until she leaves. In Mort, Ysabell
eventually falls in love with the main character. Mort and Ysabell marry
and leave Death’s home and become mortal once again. Upon leaving, the
couple is given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit. Little is
said about their lives after that, but we do know that they have a
daughter whom they name Susan. Susan, though not blood- (or bone-)
related to Death, takes on his some of his characteristics (that is what
happens when you have Death in the family). Mort and Ysabell die at the
beginning of the book Soul Music in a coach accident.

DEATH’S GRANDDAUGHTER

Mary Poppins is a magical nanny who comes to care for the Banks children
during a difficult time. She is a character in a series of children’s
books by P. L. Travers and also is the title of the Disney movie
released in 1964. The reason we bring this up is that Pratchett himself
considers the character of Susan a “Gothic Mary Poppins” in The Art of
Discworld book. One similarity is that even though Mary Poppins does
magical things (such as having tea parties while floating in the air and
jumping into chalk drawings on the sidewalk), she never admits that
these things actually happened. She also is sure to act very proper; in
a way, that seems contrary to the actual situations she finds herself,
and the Banks children, in. However, Susan, who as far as we know never
tidied up a nursery using magic and song, is quite magical and tries
very hard to be normal and proper. But, of course, the obvious
similarity
is that she is in fact a nanny in Hogfather and spends much time during
this employment beating up monsters with a metal poker.

As we mentioned before, Susan has inherited some characteristics from
her grandfather Death. When she needs to, she can walk through walls
(and objects), knows some things before they actually happen, and can
find people. She has trouble remembering to do some normal human things,
such as going to sleep and using doorknobs, just like dear old Granddad.
Despite these similarities, she spends a lot of time trying to avoid
Grandpa. Susan is mortal and does not like cats, unlike her grandfather.

Besides the nanny position, Susan has also been employed as a teacher.
Her teaching techniques are unconventional but effective. It is not
uncommon for her to take her class on field trips that involve not only
long distances but also travel through time. Her other profession,
though she tries to avoid it, is the ability to take over for Death. She
is quite capable of doing Death’s work when needed, complete with his
voice.

EMPLOYMENT

It is certainly the job of Death to collect souls. He doesn’t appear at
all deaths, but makes sure everything is going okay. On special
occasions, he collects the souls of ordinary people but, typically, his
haul encompasses witches, wizards, and royalty. His job isn’t morbid all
the time; he brings good news upon death to some, such as no more
dandruff.

Death has taken on multiple other jobs throughout the Discworld series,
from a short-order cook (Mort) to an actor (Wyrd Sisters ) . Perhaps his
most memorable job is as the Hogfather, in the book of the same title,
when he tries to revive Discworldians’ belief in the Santa Claus figure.
He also has worked as a beggar, a farmer, and in the foreign legion as a
soldier.

DEATH’S DOMAIN

It is quite apparent that one of Death’s jobs is not, and will never be,
interior decoration. Though he lacks imagination, Death does have the
ability to copy things. Therefore, his Domain is decked out with very
big rooms (they may seem unreasonably large), a bedroom suite, a
library, and even a cat flap in the back door, which seems to have been
installed in Hogfather. He finds no reason to lock the back door.
Everything is dreary, in black and gray, with the exception of living
things that include Albert (the manservant), daughter Ysabell (when
young and alive), and many cats (which appear in Hogfather). The house
appears small from the outside.

In the kitchen, you will usually find Albert frying up some type of
food. It is a good thing that Ysabell, Albert, and Mort eat, because
Death has no need to partake of food. Sometimes, Albert will deliver tea
to Death in his quarters. Perhaps this is comfort food. Albert, although
a wizard, also has been known to serve as the valet and gardener.

HOURGLASSES

Some of us are in daily contact with an hourglass—you know, the
timekeeper with two (usually glass) bulbs that transfer some type of
matter (typically sand) from the top section to the bottom one. Our
daily encounter with this symbol, however, is no longer in physical
form—it is in the form of a little icon on our computer screens and can
cause a lot of frustration. Yes, the hourglass has become a modern
symbol of consternation. How many times have you had to just stare at
the hourglass on your screen and just wait and wait?⁹²

It wouldn’t be right to discuss Death’s home without addressing the
hourglasses that are held within it. This includes the hidden room where
the hourglasses of the gods are kept; Susan discovers this room in
Hogfather. Hourglasses, at least those of humans, reflect how much life
a person has left. Once the person dies, the hourglass disappears, and
when a person is born, a new one appears. These hourglasses in
Discworld, called lifetimers, are for the most part the classic glass
and sand variety (Bill Gates is yet to have automated this process). A
separate room is used to house the god hourglasses, which include those
of the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy, and other mythological characters
that live in Discworld. (See chapter 9. ) A lifetimer is displayed on
the cover of Mort (of the HarperTorch edition that we have). In this
book, Death turns Mort’s lifetimer over to extend his life.

Hourglasses⁹³ are also known as sand glasses or sand timers. Hourglasses
are items often used in fiction to represent time. Like a genie in a
bottle, an hourglass was used in Disney’s Aladdin where Jafar, the
nemesis, traps Princess Jasmine inside. Of course, the hourglass used is
much larger than our much-loved computer icon (it is hard to determine
how large something is when animated). In the Harry Potter series, large
hourglass-looking statues are used to keep score among the different
magical houses at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And
maybe you remember the hourglass in The Wizard of Oz. You are led to
believe they are similar to Pratchett’s lifetimers, in that it is
showing the time left in the life of the main character, Dorothy. In the
end, that hourglass is used as a bomb.

Hourglasses have been symbols of our limited time on earth in various
times and cultures. They have been used since the fourteenth century,
but there is no evidence that they were used in earlier
times for real or symbolically. Some pirates were known to have pictures
of hourglasses on their flags as a reminder of our mortality. In
England, hourglasses were sometimes placed in coffins before burial.
They have also been used as a timepiece on ships.

THE DEATH OF RATS

It is obvious that the character of Death is popular; just do an
Internet search for “Pratchett’s Death” and a whole slew of stuff comes
up. While doing this, we came across a quiz that supposedly tells you
which Death you are. One of us (Carrie) was crowned the Death of Rats,
whatever that means.⁹⁴ Apparently, the quiz creators didn’t consider her
houseful of cats (two cats actually, but they seem to multiply). The
Death of Rats comes into existence in Reaper Man, where Death is
separated into many pieces (little deaths). The Death of Rats, a
creation of this separation, does not want to go back into the form of
Death. Death allows the Death of Rats to stay separate from him and
finds him to be a companion of sorts.⁹⁵

The Death of Rats has been known to collect the souls of rodents as well
as those of rodentlike humans. For instance, in Maskerade, he collects
Mr. Ponder who is immediately reincarnated into a rodent. He also has
done various other errands for Death, such as delivering messages to
Susan. He is approximately six inches tall and carries a small scythe,
like his counterpart. He has been known to SQUEAK a good conversation
that typically can be interpreted by reading the responses of those to
whom he is speaking.

WHAT’S WITH THE SCYTHE?

Apparently Father Time and the Grim Reaper are often connected or
considered the same personification. It may be due to the fact that
Death is often seen with a scythe, as is Father Time (Cronus, who was
also the god of the harvest; for more about him, see chapter 9 ) . This
explains the scythe, which is a farming tool used for cutting grass and
certain kinds of crops. It eventually succeeded the sickle in Europe in
the 1500s. Scythes are still used, mostly in less developed countries,
but have been replaced in much of the world by lawn mowers and motorized
farming equipment. Another explanation for the scythe is that death is
the “harvester of souls.”⁹⁶ In The Light Fantastic, Death makes a point
of explaining that he uses a scythe, whereas, in other worlds, the
collections instrument for souls was upgraded to combine harvesters a
long time ago.

Actually, while looking at a picture of a scythe, I (Carrie) realized
that it vaguely resembles the machete my husband used to keep in his
trunk. He claimed the machete was used for cutting grass also; he swears
he saw it done this way in Jamaica (yeah, right). I don’t recall
Pratchett’s Death cutting much grass, either, except that short period
of time he worked for Miss Flitworth under the alias of Bill Door, in
Reaper Man. You know, Good Old Bill, as the locals at the tavern
referred to him after he purposely lost at pond (pool) and darts.

He spends a lot of time in Reaper Man trying to figure out how to make
his scythe sharper.

CAPITAL LETTERS AND THE LANGUAGE OF DEATH

It seems appropriate that Death’s words are represented in a unique way
in the Discworld books. After all, he has no vocal cords to actually
make sound, being a skeleton and all. Death’s words are all written in
small capital letters. His talking is described in Carpe Jugulum as “an
echo inside the head.”⁹⁷ When he takes the place of the Hogfather in the
book by the same name, the capital letters are no longer small. This
must be due to a personality trait of extra confidence that he must
portray as the Hogfather. Death is not real good with frivolous or
everyday conversation. You would probably not ask him about the weather
or make small talk with him about current events.

Capital letters, a.k.a. upper case or majuscule, would make no
difference, for instance, in Chinese writing, where lowercase and
uppercase letters are not distinguished. In English, capital letters
have had meaning since around 1300. Other than signifying the beginning
of a sentence or a name, capital letters are used at times to bring
emphasis to a word or phrase. Capital letters are considered by some to
be harder to read than lowercase letters and are sometimes used in legal
documents to serve that very purpose. It has come to our attention very
recently that writing in capital letters in e-mails can be a form of
shouting—called “flaming”—at a person or group (offensive, we guess).

Due to the fact that Death knows all, he is therefore quite literate.
His chosen form of writing is gothic script. For instance, in Reaper
Man, he tries to teach a chicken named Cyril to “cocka-doodle-doo”
properly by writing it down on a board with a piece of chalk, and
expects him to read it. Gothic script could be referring to the gothic
alphabet, which we certainly would have difficulty reading, even though
we aren’t an illiterate chicken. The Gothic language is thought to have
originally employed a runic alphabet known as the gothic runes. The
gothic runes are thought to be the invention of the Goths who were
dwellers of dunes (maybe these were decorated like Death’s Domain).
Runes were replaced with
the gothic alphabet in the fourth century A.D. If we were referring to
Death’s writing style in font types, we probably would consider sans
serif because it is considered gothic. Regular serif font is considered
Roman. Serif fonts are considered easier to read than sans serif but
typically the living don’t read Death’s notes. In Hogfather, it is
mentioned that Death uses serifs in his handwriting when Susan finds a
note in his handwriting.

DODGING DEATH: GAMES AND BOXES

Okay, time for an exercise that requires some imagination and a whole
lot of insurance (on our part). Let’s say you die. This is not a death
threat; let’s just say you do. Now, imagine that an Angel of Death
appears to you. What do you do?⁹⁸ Many writers have toyed with the idea
of wagering with Death by playing a game with him/her. The idea is if
you win the game, then Death grants you another chance at life. This
thought seems to date back to the Middle Ages; a medieval painting by
Albertus Pictor depicts Death, as a skeleton, playing chess with a human
man. In Pratchett’s Discworld, it is not that Death can grant life; he
is only able to give an extension.

The 1957 Swedish film The Seventh Seal, directed by Ingmar Bergman, has
a medieval knight playing chess with Death. Death accepts the knight’s
wager of extended life if he wins against him in the game. During the
movie, the knight reveals his game strategy to the local priest who
turns out to be Death himself. The game buys the knight time to see his
wife again and to help others during the threat of plague.

In the 1991 movie Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey, a sequel to the successful
comedy Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, the main characters
successfully beat Death, played by William Sadler, at Battleship, Clue,
electric football, and Twister, successfully, but Death keeps asking for
a rematch.

In the Discworld series, there are multiple instances where Death is
willing to wager death with a character by playing a game. In Maskerade,
you find Granny Weatherwax playing against Death to keep a baby from
dying.

A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT CATS

If you saw the movie Prince of Egypt, an animated film about the Bible’s
Moses that was released in 1998 by Dreamworks, you have heard the song
“Playing with the Big Boys.” The sorcerers, who are trying to prove they
are better than Moses and his God, use this song to summon gods. Now,
you’re wondering what this has to do with cats and, even more important,
what this has to do with Death? Well, one of the gods that is called up
is Bast. Bast was the Egyptian cat god and it was in ancient Egypt that
cats were first taken in as pets. Now, we are not implying that Death
worships cats, but he sure seems to like them a lot. In Pratchett’s book
Sourcery, Ipslore, in a contrary manner, asks Death, “[W]hat is there in
this world that truly makes living worthwhile?” Death, after some
thought replies, “CATS … . CATS ARE NICE.”⁹⁹ In The Last Hero, Death
confirms his affection for cats by saying, “I DON’T HOLD WITH CRUELTY TO
CATS.”¹⁰⁰ In Hogfather, Susan finds Death’s domain full of living cats.

We, the authors of this book, collectively have a total of two cats.
Which means that Linda has zero and I (Carrie) have two. We can
understand why Death would like them so much. They are lovable and
comforting, kind of like a bedtime cup of tea. It is quite
ironic that Death has such a love, if you will, for cats. After all,
Death has no need to sleep, even though he made sure his bedroom has a
bed, and cats can spend almost sixteen hours a day sleeping. It may be
comforting to Death that cats can see him whether or not they are dead.

 

 

In conclusion, we would like to reiterate the importance of the
personification of death in Pratchett’s writings. Benjamin Franklin put
it this way, “Certainty? In this world nothing is certain but death and
taxes.”¹⁰¹

A Powerful Personality

Old man trouble, I don’t mind him
You won’t find him ’round my door.¹⁰²

IF YOU BELIEVE …

In beauty pageants, winning First Runner-up or Miss Congeniality is a
consolation prize. Look what it did for undercover FBI agent Gracie
Hart, played by Sandra Bullock in the movie of the latter title.
Although it proves that at least you have personality, everyone would
prefer to wear the crown.

In Discworld, if you can’t be a god (Blind Io) but you’re immortal,
chances are you’re the next runner-up—a personification of something.
(An “anthropomorphic personification” as Miss Tick explains in
Wintersmith.¹⁰³) Some might say you’re still a god or, at times, a royal
pain.

The idea of personifying the seasons or other aspects of life
comes from mythology—a creative way of looking at the origin of all
things. In the Discworld books, Pratchett often mentions how faith in
their existence shapes these immortals. They are what they are because
of what the people of Discworld believe.

Peter Pan once warned Wendy that every time someone expressed disbelief
in a fairy, one died. In Discworld, particularly in such books as
Hogfather, you can see the aftermath of this idea. When the plot to kill
the Hogfather gets under way, the personifications people thought should
exist but they needed more belief in them until they could exist used to
believe in and which died out—the Verruca Gnome, the oh God of
Hangovers, the Cheerful Fairy, the Eater of Socks, the Hair Loss Fairy,
the God of Indigestion—gain existence once more, helped by a bathroom
designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson.

Besides the ones above, who are the immortals of Discworld? We talked
about Death in the last chapter. Let’s move on to some of the other
major elementals.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

LET’S RIDE: JOINING THE HORSEY SET

Let’s face it, if the four horsemen ride, well, the world is about to
end. It’s Armageddon and we don’t mean the old Bruce Willis movie
(although that was about a cataclysmic event signaling the end of the
world). The four horsemen of the Apocalypse (five in Discworld,
including Kaos) get a shout-out in chapter 6 of the Book of Revelation
in the Bible and make a cameo in yet another sixth chapter, this one in
an Old Testament book—Zechariah. In Revelation, they are the riders in
white (Pestilence), red (War), black (Famine), and pale green
(Death)—the anti-Easy Riders.

Nothing but a Pest

Pestilence is a plague or disease that can wipe out significant segments
of a population. In the fourteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries, it was the black death (plague) that troubled several areas
in Europe. In our day, the AIDS virus has killed millions.

But in Discworld, Pestilence is a whiny sort of guy who hangs out in
hospitals. It’s fitting that Death seeks out Pestilence first in Thief
of Time, because he is first in the order of the riders listed in
Revelation chapter 6. Being first doesn’t make him the most powerful of
the horsemen of the “Apocralypse” nor does it mean that he’s the leader.
He’s just a herald of the end of the world.

War! Huh! What Is It Good For?

Aside from being the subject of an Edwin Starr song from 1970, the god
of war in Greek mythology is Ares, the tempestuous and little-liked son
of Zeus and Hera. (Yeah, we know. Kevin Smith played him in the Xena:
Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys series.) In Roman
mythology, he is Mars—for which the Red Planet was named.

In Discworld, War is a henpecked husband married to a former Valkyrie.
When you first see War, you can’t help but think of a retiree who sits
around reminiscing about the good old days. Yet he answers the call to
action, when summoned in Thief of Time.

Famished

“When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature
say, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a black horse!
Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand” (Revelation 6:5, New
International Version). That’s the description of the third rider—the
one who measures the high cost of bread, a way of indicating its
scarcity. You’ve read about the sad result of famine in various parts of
the world due to drought and other natural disasters. And Ichabod Crane
in Washington Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” is described as a
veritable poster child for famine. But in Discworld, Famine is a guy
hanging out in a restaurant longing after mayonnaise (or salad cream, if
you prefer). But he, too, joins in the battle for the universe in Thief
of Time. What would the end of the world be without famine?

IT’S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR: SEASONAL AND HOLIDAY
PERSONIFICATIONS

It’s About Time

Time isn’t just something you mark or kill. In mythology, Time is
actually a person—a personification of time. Every New Year’s Eve, you
hear about Father Time—the old man with the scythe (not the Grim Reaper)
who gets ready to make way for the new kid on the block. But in Greek
mythology, he is Chronos (also spelled Kronos and Cronus), a guy with a
plethora of jobs on his résumé: the king of the Titans, the god of time,
and the unhappy father of Zeus who made child abuse an art form. Chronos
is the Latin form of the Greek word for “time.” In Roman mythology, he
is Saturn.

In Discworld, Time is a female—the mother of Lobsang Ludd whom Susan
encounters in Thief of Time. (Maybe that’s why Pratchett uses a capital
letter in reference to Time in such books as Reaper Man.) You might call
her “Mother Time,” although she probably wouldn’t answer to that.

Lobsang becomes the new kid on the block when he takes over for his
mother as the personification of time in Thief of Time. Time for a
change, we suppose.

In Hog Heaven

Back when you were a kid, maybe you believed in Santa. (Maybe you still
do.) That’s what kids usually do. We know that Santa Claus comes from
the legends of Saint Nicholas—the bishop of Myra from the fourth
century. The Hogfather is the Santa Claus/Father Christmas of Discworld,
whose sleigh is pulled not by reindeer but by four boars (Gouger,
Router, Tusker, and Snouter). For this spirit of Hogs-watch, pork pies
and sherry take the place of the cookies and milk kids leave out for
Santa in our world. But many of their other trappings of the holiday are
the same: the mistletoe, the sleigh, the stockings, the carol singers,
the coal, etc. Makes you feel all warm inside, doesn’t it?

A Winter Wonderland

Old Man Winter/Father Winter, the personification of winter, comes from
Russian folklore. The Wintersmith is the personification of winter in
Discworld. While a blacksmith forges metals, the Wintersmith forges snow
and ice. Although the Wintersmith is as old as the hills, he appears to
Tiffany Aching—his crush—as a young man.

Discworld also has a Jack Frost who personifies frost and has a fern
fixation, apparently. While the Wintersmith pelts the world with Tiffany
Aching-shaped snowflakes, Jack paints windows with fern patterns. But
Jack Frost comes from Norse mythology and Russian folklore. You’ve
probably seen him as a winter sprite—a mischievous creature in such
movies as Santa Clause 3 and obliquely in the 1996 Jack Frost, where he
is a serial killer-turned-snowman
who’s “chillin … and killin’,” according to the movie tagline. Talk
about “Jack Frost nipping at your nose,” as the song goes, not to
mention your legs and other important appendages. (Thank you, Ben
Pyykkonen, for your inspiration on that last line.)

Summer in the City

While the Summer Lady, the personification of summer, looks like Tiffany
(thanks to some interference by Tiffany in an endless dance of the
seasons), hers is a Pratchett makeover à la the Persephone story from
Greek mythology (see chapter 1) . Persephone was the daughter of
Demeter, the goddess of the harvest. After Hades, lord of the
Underworld, grabbed Persephone (without even asking for a date) and
dragged her to the Underworld, Persephone’s enforced stay caused Demeter
to grieve and neglect the plants and trees—thus leading to the deadness
of winter.

The Summer Lady is like Demeter in that she can cause plants to
grow—which happens in the spring and summer. But she’s also like Opora,
the personification of the part of summer when fruit is at its peak.
That season is August through September, according to Hesiod’s Theogony.

YOU ARE WHAT YOU DO: HOW SOME PERSONIFICATIONS ARE DEFINED

“It’s not who I am underneath … But what I do that defines me,” declares
Batman in Batman Begins.¹⁰⁴ Some of the other personifications in
Discworld could say the same thing.

Sweet Dreams Are Made of Sand

Who is the Sandman? A being who puts people to sleep without boring
them. If you read the classic graphic novels on the Sandman—Preludes and
Nocturnes being one of them—written by Neil Gaiman (Pratchett’s coauthor
for Good Omens) and illustrated by Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, and
Malcolm Jones III, you might feel that that series provides the
definitive portrayal of the Sandman. He is Dream—the personification of
dreams a.k.a. Morpheus. (Morpheus in the Matrix movies had the opposite
goal: to wake people up.) Dream, the younger brother of Death (a
Goth-looking female), is one of the Endless—not the kind to hit people
on the head with sandbags full of sand, like the Discworld Sandman does.
Gaiman’s Sandman is someone who could be summoned like the Death of
Discworld—by an occult rite that traps him for several decades until he
escapes.

Even if you haven’t read Gaiman’s graphic novels, you might know that
Morpheus comes from Greek mythology. He’s the most powerful of the gods
of dreams (the Oneroi) and the son of Hypnos, the god of sleep. Ovid
wrote about the family in Metamorphoses. Morpheus’s brothers—Phobeter
and Phantasos—also personify dreams.

Supposedly, the Sandman of mythology sprinkles dust in the eyes of
children to make them fall asleep. “Ready for a visit from the Sandman,
Rachel? Close your eyes.” Well, that’s what parents tell their kids.
Wishful thinking. Speaking of wishful thinking, back in the 1950s a song
called “Mr. Sandman,” written by Pat Ballard, described some thoughts
about the Sandman’s job. It was popular in the United States and Great
Britain.

Tooth Fairy

The Tooth Fairy has existed for ages, thanks to candy, stories told
around Europe, and movies starring Kirstie Alley (Toothless). You know
the racket—lose a baby tooth, gain money. Sweet. (Doesn’t work if you
pull out a permanent tooth.) But if you saw The 10th Kingdom—a
fairy-tale miniseries on NBC in 2000 available on DVD (also a novel)—you
know that the Tooth Fairy was a sadistic prison dentist. He didn’t give
money—only pain.

In Discworld, the Tooth Fairy isn’t an imaginary figure who goes around
leaving money under kids’ pillows. Discworld’s first bogeyman is the
head Tooth Fairy, a job that passes to Banjo Lilywhite (see chapter 12)
in Hogfather. The Tooth Fairy’s tooth collection routes are parceled out
like paper routes, and are managed by “tooth girls.” That’s why the
Tooth Fairy is known in Discworld as Violet Bottler and various other
names. But Tooth Fairy’s headquarters is a castle full of small teeth—a
castle formed from the beliefs of kids everywhere.

Discworld also has a Clinkerbell, who claims to be a troll Tooth Fairy
in Feet of Clay. But that’s another story.

The Soul Cake Duck

If you’re looking for the Easter Bunny in Discworld, look no further
than the Soul Cake Duck, who comes on Soul Cake Tuesday, rather than on
a holiday like Easter. Soul Cake Tuesday signals the start of duck
hunting season. On this day, children hunt for the chocolate eggs laid
by the Soul Cake Duck. (In our world, we have the ones made by Cadbury
or Hershey.)

We can’t help wondering if the Soul Cake Duck inspired Puley the Pule
Duck, who showed up in an episode of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron.

THE FACES OF FEAR: NIGHTMARE PERSONIFICATIONS

Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. showed some of the fears common to kids. Some
personifications or creatures of the imagination are all about fears,
some of which we never outgrow.

Old Man Trouble

Putting a name and a face to something you fear takes the edge off it.
Trouble is the same way. Besides being a song by Stephen Sills and a
line from a George Gershwin song from 1930 (just after the troublesome
Stock Market Crash), Old Man Trouble is one of the odd gods of
Discworld. You can gain a sense of his reputation in Hogfather, where
he’s described as “nasty.” Isn’t that just how trouble is?

The Scissor Man

The Scissor Man, who gets a mention in Hogfather, was a headscratcher to
us, even after Jasper Fforde, the writer of the Tuesday Next and Nursery
Crime series, mentioned a Scissor-man in The Fourth Bear. Guess our moms
forgot to tell us about him. In Fforde’s book, the Scissor-man runs
around with a giant pair of scissors and threatens to cut off the thumbs
of a kid named Conrad. (There’s no watchdog committee for behavior like
that.) Sounds like something out of Edward Scissorhands—the 1990 movie
directed by Tim Burton.

But the Scissor Man comes from a book by Heinrich Hoffman published in
1845 called Der Struwwelpeter—a book of “happy” nursery rhymes in the
vein of Mother Goose-gone-Rambo. “Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutcher”
(“The Story of the Thumb-Sucker”) describes the fate of one Konrad—a
thumb-sucker who failed to heed his mother’s warning and wound up with
both thumbs
cut off by giant scissors wielded by a man known as “the tailor.” The
late Rod Serling, creator of The Twilight Zone, could not have come up
with a more macabre tale—one sure to horrify parents and delight kids.

Discworld’s Scissor Man isn’t exactly a man, but a creature made of
blades and with a stronger fear factor than “the tailor.” This creature
would be handy (or rather, “scissory”) to have around the garment
district of New York.

The Bogeyman

Did a parent ever warn you about the bogeyman? Most kids have been given
a vague story about the bogeyman. The vaguer the story, the more
frightening the imaginary creature. For some, he hides in the closet,
like the monsters of Monsters, Inc., waiting to jump out when the lights
go off. For many, he hides under the bed—again, like some of the
monsters of Monsters, Inc. For others, he might bear the face of the
latest serial killer or, sadly, a hurtful relative.

In Discworld, there is more than one bogeyman. We talked about
Discworld’s first bogeyman earlier. But other bogeymen, for instance,
Mr. Schleppel (Reaper Man), Shlimazel (Hogfather), and Shlitzen (Feet of
Clay) exist, too. (Note the pattern of the bogeymen names.) Throwing a
blanket over them creates in them a sense of “existential uncertainty,”
as Pratchett describes in Feet of Clay and Hogfather. In other words,
they’re not sure they exist. If only we could do that with bills.

 

 

Imagine having the power to cause personifications to pop into
existence. What would your fears or hopes bring into existence?
Hopefully, you won’t suffer the fate of Peachy, whose belief in the
Scissor Man leads him to … the twilight zone.

It’s a Small World After All

“Look, he’s six inches high and lives in a mushroom,” snarled Rincewind.
“Of course he’s a bloody gnome.”¹⁰⁵

A TINY BIT OF DISCWORLD

When Lemuel Gulliver, the sailor in Jonathan Swift’s classic, Gulliver’s
Travels, was shipwrecked in Lilliput, he learned that the world was
indeed small, for the land was filled with tiny people about six inches
high (Lilliputians). Although normal-size back home, Gulliver was a
giant to them.

Tiny people can also be found in Discworld. And we don’t mean really
teensy like Lucas, who was shrunk to ant size in The Ant Bully, or the
kids or adults in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and its sequels. We mean the
four- to six-inch variety—possibly even a little smaller. They are the
gnomes, Pictsies, fairies, and imps. Don’t be a hater or an
underestimater because they’re small. If you were involved in a
role-playing game and wanted some characters with power, you might do
well to have some of these tiny titans on your side. Check out their
stats.

GNOME ON THE RANGE

If you read Terry Brooks’s Shannara series, you probably have a
different take on gnomes than you would from Gnomes by Wil Huygen and
illustrated by Rien Poortvliet, the Harry Potter series, The Time-Life
Encyclopedia of Things that Never Were, or Phantastes (George
MacDonald), or in old video games like The Sims: Bustin’ Out, or if you
checked out those found in gardens all across the world. In Gnomes, you
find little old men about fifteen centimeters high (nearly six
inches—the size of the Death of Rats, by the way) with long white beards
and red pointed hats. (There are female gnomes as well. Unlike Discworld
dwarfs, they don’t have beards.) This is the concept of gnomes that many
people have. Perhaps these are the creatures depicted in Tiffany’s book,
The Goode Childe’s Booke of Faerie Tales (The Wee Free Men). But in the
Shannara series, gnomes are bigger.

Gnomes aren’t the same as leprechauns—the little green men of Irish
folklore who supposedly know where gold is and often make shoes—or
toy-making Christmas elves or the other kind of elves that make shoes
also. Gnomes come from the folklore of a number of countries, including
Germany, Switzerland, and France. Supposedly, they’re helpful to humans,
unlike some other fairy-tale folk (e.g., goblins and ogres). (In the
Shannara series, they’re anything but helpful, seeing as how they prefer
to fraternize with the enemy of good.)

In Discworld, gnomes are about the same height as those described in
Gnomes, judging by Wee Mad Arthur—the rat-catching precursor to the Nac
Mac Feegle Buggy Swires—one of the City Watch’s finest, who is described
as “a mile high in pent-up aggression,” ¹⁰⁶ the “Swires” mentioned in
The Light Fantastic, who seem too
good-natured to be Buggy Swires, and the Glingleglingleglingle Fairy—a
gnome in Hogfather.

Wee Mad Arthur is like a more cynical, tougher version of the Borrowers
from Mary Norton’s classic children’s series of the same name. Instead
of matchboxes and thimbles, he “borrows” rats he finds lying around. He
may be small, but he’s got skills.

And Buggy Swires … like Wee Mad Arthur, he’s little but mean—not someone
you’d want to cross if you’re a perpetrator or an animal predator like a
mountain lion.

In classic fairy tales, gnomes are bigger in size. They’re more like
dwarfs—the earth dwellers (which is what their name means in Latin) who
guard a treasure hoard. (In the Harry Potter series, goblins perform
this function at Gringott’s Wizard Bank. There are garden gnomes in the
series, however.) Think about Ruggedo the Nome (“gnome” without the g)
King in The Magic of Oz and other Oz stories by L. Frank Baum. (Or not,
if you wish.)

Pratchett included nomes (again without the g) in The Bromeliad—a series
he wrote for kids. (Truckers, Diggers, and Wings.) In that series, which
takes place in the late twentieth century, we first meet the nomes
living in a store. In Truckers, a group of nomes find a group of garden
gnomes on sale. The nomes aren’t sure what to make of them. If they were
like many people in the States, they would take the nomes and film them
in various spots around the country. Don’t ask us why. It’s just done.

WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A NAC MAC FEEGLE, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICT

Irish playwright J. M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan and the subject of
Finding Neverland, created Tinker Bell, a small, mischievous fairy “no
longer than your hand,”¹⁰⁷ who scatters fairy dust everywhere.
You might also think of her as a pixie, but not like the Cornish pixies
in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (who are stupid and mean) or
the ones in the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer, where every
fairy-tale creature tends to be on the tough side, due to the nature of
the series. Because of Tinker Bell, Wendy and her brothers could fly.

As with everything else, Pratchett sets mythology on its ear. His pixies
are Pictsies, a cross between pixies and Picts—tribal groups (possibly
Aborigines or their descendants) living in northeastern Scotland before
Scotland was … well, Scotland. The Picts were invaded by the Romans, the
Gaels, and later, the Vikings. “Pict” means “painted” and probably
refers to tattoos sported by some. (Bet you’re thinking of Braveheart
right now.) Although their history still remains somewhat shrouded in
mystery, the Picts are known for their elaborately carved stones and
brooches and their kings. If you happen to have read The Bridei
Chronicles by Juliet Marillier, starting with The Dark Mirror, you read
about the Picts and the kingdom of Fortriu, which only exists now as
part of history.

According to Marillier’s Web site, the Romans saw the Picts as “tiny,
dark people who darted under stones for concealment.”¹⁰⁸ Not exactly a
PC description you’d want to add to a travel brochure. We can’t help
wondering whether this fanciful view inspired Pratchett in the creation
of his Pictsies—the Nac Mac Feegles or the Wee Free Men. The Feegles
have skin almost blue with tattoos, wear kilts, have red hair, and talk
in a dialect reminiscent of Scottish. They’re literally a family—a large
family, since a kelda, the female leader of the clan, can have hundreds
of children. They’re like ants in a way, if ants could get drunk and
liked to fight. But they mirror an ant’s ability to lift objects far
bigger and heavier than they are. And they can get in and out of
impossible places.

You can see echoes of the Picts’ struggle for survival in the Feegles’
battles with the invading Fairy Queen and her dromes (for more about
them, see chapter 12 of this book) and grimhounds (see chapter 13) in
The Wee Free Men, the hiver (A Hat Full of Sky), and the bogles
(Wintersmith; we call them boggles or boggarts). Through it all, they
seem to enjoy themselves. They’re like the men of Rohan who sing in
battle in Return of the King (the book). And why shouldn’t the Feegles
feel relaxed about the fight? They’re dead, after all—or so they
believe.

Everyone probably has their favorite Feegle. We’re partial to Daft
Wullie, “Big Man” Rob Anybody, and
Not-as-Big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-Bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock. At a book
signing in Naperville, Illinois, in 2006, Pratchett confessed to a
partiality for Daft Wullie, the brother of Rob Anybody—a name that’s a
job description, if anything. Maybe that’s why Daft Wullie gets the best
lines. The other Feegle names like Awf’ly Wee Billy Bigchin and Slightly
Mad Angus are extremely descriptive as well. The female Feegles—the clan
leaders—have normal names (Jeannie, Fion), and the most common sense,
according to them.

It’s fitting that the females are the leaders, since kings of the Picts
supposedly succeeded to the throne based on their mothers’ family line.
Tiffany Aching is a temporary kelda after the death of the kelda in The
Wee Free Men, until she surrenders the position by avoiding marrying Rob
Anybody (to their mutual relief).

FEROCIOUS FAIRIES

Of course, Discworld has to have fairies as well. After all, the Fairy
Queen has to have subjects. The fairies are the elves (see chapters 5
and chapter 12). They’re part of the Fairyland ambience. And they’re not
nice; they’re annoying like mosquitoes and just as intent on blood.
There must be something about having an address in Fairyland that causes
a bad attitude.

Fairies have the ability to change their size, which is why we’re
mentioning them in this chapter. Although smaller than the Feegles,
their cruel intent makes up for any height lack. The wasp-size ones with
dragonfly wings that Tiffany and the Feegles encounter aren’t your
Tinker Bells, or the colorful and delightful, but mischievous flower
fairies Anodos encounters in Phantastes (George MacDonald), or the
human-size and hot fairies Finvarra and Midir in The Hunter’s Moon (O.
R. Melling), who also are mischievous. Discworld fairies are closer to
the goblin-fairies who chase Anodos, and would make Brian Froud’s Bad
Faeries list for sure. Thankfully, they’re defeated by poetry, just as
the goblins were in George MacDonald’s The Princess and the Goblin.

IMP-POSSIBLE

If you read The Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis, which features a
correspondence between the demon Screwtape and his nephew, Wormwood; or
Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory’s Obsidian Trilogy (and plan to read
the follow-up books to that series), you probably have a different
concept of imps than those found in Discworld; Princess Mononoke—the
groundbreaking 1999 movie by Hayao Miyazaki—or other anime features
(e.g., Howl’s Moving Castle—also by Miyazaki); or other fantasy books
such as Jim Butcher’s Dresden Files. In Discworld, imps are tolerated
rather than feared or loathed. Although they’re still considered demons,
they’re servants, like golems. They run the Dis-organizers and
iconographs. How small are they? Small enough to fit in an organizer
that fits in Vimes’s pocket. Although many of them don’t have names,
some do (e.g., Sidney and Rodney—picture-painting imps).

Maybe the imp-in-the-box setup sounds familiar if you’re into
thermodynamics. Back in chapter 3, we talked about the second law of
thermodynamics. To refresh your memory: “The total entropy of any
isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over
time, approaching a maximum value.”¹⁰⁹ Back in the day—1867 to be
exact—a physicist named James Clerk Maxwell came up with a theory that
apparently violated the second law of thermodynamics. Suppose, Maxwell
says, there was a demon guarding a small trapdoor between two connected
boxes (box 1 and box 2) or a box divided in half (halves 1 and 2), both
boxes or halves of which are filled with gas. If a molecule from box
1/half 1 moving faster than the ones in box 2/half 2 was allowed into
box 2/half 2, well, the second law of thermodynamics would technically
be broken. Why? Because the average speed and temperature of the
molecules in the second box or half will have increased while decreasing
in the first.

Imps even differ in concept from the dhlangs—the evil spirits Lobsang
and Lu-Tze discuss in Thief of Time—the pure evil (an oxymoron if ever
there was one) kind. But according to Susan Sto Helit, dhlangs are, as
Pratchett describes, a “substition”—something people don’t really
believe in, unlike a superstition. But the dhlangs, we learn, are the
Auditors. How fitting.

That concludes our little look at “Little” Discworld. If “It’s a Small
World After All” is running through your mind right now, well, don’t
blame us.

Home of the Brave

It, uh, seems to me that what you need is a hero.

—Hercules in the 1997 Disney movie Hercules, written and codirected by
Ron Clements

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

DO THE RIGHT THING?

You know the hero or heroine (especially a superhero or superheroine) is
about to enter the scene or perform a heroic deed just by the way the
music swells. You know—lots of clear, noble-sounding horns.
Dun-dun-dun-dun! Like the musical version of Ta-da! or Voilà! or Eureka!

The world of literature (including movies) has a heaping helping of
heroes, heroes who fit the archetype described by Christopher Vogler as
“someone who is willing to sacrifice his own needs on behalf of others,
like a shepherd who will sacrifice to protect and serve his flock.”¹¹⁰
Risk and sacrifice are expected behaviors of the
hero. It’s part of the “Code”—but not the code referred to in The
Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Pratchett refers to
the Code in The Last Hero.

You remember those heroic moments long after you close the book or leave
the movie theater: Sydney Carton’s “far, far better” act of giving his
life in place of Charles Darnay, the man who looks like him in Dickens’s
A Tale of Two Cities. Luke Skywalker taking the one-in-a-million shot to
blow up the Death Star in Star Wars: A New Hope. Neo fully realizing
that he is “the One” in the first Matrix. Trinity’s amazing leap off a
building and through a doorway in the same movie. Peter Parker saying,
“Who am I? I’m Spider-Man,” at the end of the first Spider-Man movie.
Bruce Wayne as Batman gliding across the city at the end of Batman
Begins. They’re heroes larger than life, like the ultimate heroes from
Greek mythology—Hercules/Herakles, Achilles, Jason, and Odysseus.

But what about Moist von Lipwig (Going Postal), Windle Poons (Reaper
Man), or Roland de Chumsfanleigh (Wintersmith)? Or, for that matter,
what about Adora Belle Dearheart, the chain-smoking golem advocate in
Going Postal or Renata Flitworth, the elderly farm owner whom Death, as
Bill Door, romances in Reaper Man? They don’t look anything like your
typical hero.

In Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, Terry Brooks’s The Sword of
Shannara (volume 1 of that series), and countless other epic fantasies,
you meet an unlikely hero—the one you never expect to save the day.
Discworld is full of the most unlikely savers of the day you’ll ever
find.

So, how do you spot the hero or heroine?

Follow the liver pills.

If you saw Troy, Braveheart, or 300, you saw a bunch of buff, amazingly
heroic types (and some wimps like Paris). But in The
Light Fantastic, up pops Cohen the Barbarian, who makes return visits in
Interesting Times and The Last Hero, with his Silver Horde. Cohen is
like Conan and Genghis Khan, with his conquering, takeno-prisoners
panache. Cohen and Company have been heroes for many, many decades. They
may be as old as the hills, but they’re still bold enough to conquer an
army and take on the gods of Discworld. And they seem to have no trouble
finding willing women. Guess they’re the geriatric James Bonds of their
day.

With The Last Hero, we can’t help thinking of Cocoon, the 1985 movie in
which a group of retirees goes on a last adventure. But the Silver
Horde, which includes Vena the Raven-Haired, are a little misguided in
their efforts and have to be steered back by one of the true heroes of
the story—Carrot. More on him later.

And then there’s Windle Poons, the wizard who doesn’t let his one
hundred and thirtieth birthday or death stop him from becoming a hero.
It’s only fitting that his adventure take place in the same book (Reaper
Man) as that of feisty Mrs. Flitworth, who risks her life to help the
old Death defeat the new Death after the old Death (the one we know and
love) is fired by the Auditors, who are living proof of the Peter
Principle.

Even his fellow wizards discount Windle. After all, Windle is supposed
to be dead. But as a zombie, Windle becomes an unlikely hero, one who
has to help the other wizards and lead a ragtag group of “Fresh
Starters”—Reg Shoe’s support group for the undead—to victory against the
parasitic life force threatening Ankh-Morpork. Helping save human lives
is something you never expect a zombie to do.

Look for the uniform.

By this we don’t mean the Watch. Yes, they’re heroic. (Well, some of
them are. We talked all about Vimes in chapter 2. We’ll talk about
Carrot and Angua in a minute.) But we’re talking about the average
joe like Maladict, Polly Perks, Igor, Lofty, Tonker, and the rest of the
“men” of the Tenth Foot Light Infantry (the Ins-and-Outs) under the
command of Sergeant Jackrum (Monstrous Regiment)—the kind who sacrifice
their lives to run off to fight a war.

Polly is half-Fa Mulan, half-Rosalind (see chapter 5) in that she takes
a man’s name and garb to join the regiment (à la Mulan), but not his
place (à la Rosalind, who impersonated a man, but did not assume the
identity of someone else in the story). Instead, she joins up to search
for her brother. As it turns out, there are a number of “Rosalinds” in
the regiment. Unlike Joan of Arc, who saw war as a holy cause, Polly is
a realist who doesn’t really fight in the name of the god Nuggan or the
Duchess—the semireligious figure of the book. She fights for the
Duchess—the inn her family owns.

Look for the sword.

Although each member of the Watch carries a sword (standard equipment
according to Men at Arms), not every member is a hero. A hero needs a
sword. As Rob Anybody says in Wintersmith, “Who ever heard o’ a Hero
wi’oot a sword?”¹¹¹ You’ll find a sword in many fantasy epics—Minneyar
(Memory Year), Sorrow, and Thorn—three lost swords used to fight evil
(Tad Williams); the famed sword of Jerle Shannara in the Shannara
series; the Sword of Truth that only the Seeker of Truth can wield
(Terry Goodkind); Narsil/Andúril in Lord of the Rings; Godric
Gryffindor’s sword (J. K. Rowling); and the grandfather of epic
swords—Excalibur.

Captain Carrot fits the hidden king archetype because of his kingly
bearing, parentage, and the heirloom sword he brings with him when he
joins the Watch. We talked about that a bit in chapter 1. Now consider
other hidden kings, such as Aragorn in Lord of the Rings and Arthur—men
whose swords also have legacies.

Because Carrot follows the hero’s code closer than the Silver Horde in
The Last Hero (a title that always reminds us of Last Action Hero—the
1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie), he is able to save the day, along
with Rincewind, the reluctant volunteer on the mission, and Leonard of
Quirm.

Awkward, not-quite-a-man Roland, the son of the baron, takes up the
sword in Wintersmith. (He’s probably sixteen at this point.) We talked
about him in chapter 1. He’s the hero called in by Granny Weatherwax to
help save the day. But since this is a Pratchett creation, the sword he
wields to victory isn’t the one he brings from home, but one from his
vivid imagination—one that really works. Sort of like playing air guitar
or Guitar Hero—only with a sword.

Never underestimate a woman.

Heroines aren’t only found in the Lancre witch and Tiffany Aching books.
There’s Adora Belle Dearheart, golem advocate. Moist von Lipwig calls
her “Spike,” while her brother goes for the more affectionate “Killer.”
Sweet. She’s not a Mary Jane Watson—tough, but in need of rescuing in
every movie. She’s more along the lines of a Rose Tyler (played by
Billie Piper on the Doctor Who TV series), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher)
or Rachel, Katie Holmes’s character in Batman Begins. Yes, these
characters occasionally had to be rescued. But Rose had to rescue the
Doctor occasionally and help save the world on practically every show.
Rachel knew how to wield a Taser or a gun when a mugger threatened or
Scarecrow and a vicious mob tried to harm a child. And Princess Leia had
fighting skills. (The book series goes into her story more.)

Adora Belle’s weapon of choice is a pair of well-sharpened stilettos,
which she operates like Dirty Harry, the magnum-toting homicide
detective (Harry Callahan) played by Clint Eastwood in the 1971 film of
the same name, whose words she parodies in Going Postal.

Speaking of weapons, Conina is a weapon herself, thanks to the
genes she inherited from her dad, Cohen the Barbarian. (Her mother was
Bethan, a woman Cohen met in The Light Fantastic. She’s no shrinking
violet, either.) She’s a warrior, able to handle weapons along the lines
of a warrior like Shu Lien, Michelle Yeoh’s character in Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon—the Oscar winner for best foreign language film in
2000—or Ziyi Zhang’s character in the same movie—Jen, the vicious
disciple of Jade Fox, a vengeful woman.

And then there’s Lady Myria LeJean, the Auditor turned human, who fights
against her own beings. She’s also known as Unity. The concept of an
enemy becoming an ally is one you see played out in books and movies. We
can’t help thinking of the Terminator who killed humans in the first
movie, but sacrificed himself for the greater good in Terminator 2.
Guess reprogramming helps. Also, there’s something about tasting
humanity for the first time, which causes some to see the light. The
last unicorn, after becoming a human and experiencing human love in The
Last Unicorn, found humanity difficult to give up. (But that doesn’t
mean she didn’t give it up.)

But getting back to Lady LeJean, the pseudonym she takes upon taking on
flesh, the human experience is simply too much to bear, as she discovers
simply by eating chocolate. Maybe that’s why she decides to go out with
a bang as Thelma and Louise did in the 1991 movie that bears their
names. Perhaps if a large vat of chocolate had been available, Thelma
and Louise would’ve jumped into that instead of going off that cliff.

And how about that Sybil Ramkin Vimes—the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork?
She’s like socialite Veronica Vreeland in the old Batman animated
series, in that she has a high social status and deeply cares about
animals. Those animals just happen to be swamp dragons. But she’s unlike
Veronica, in that she’s humble rather than bored and spoiled. She is
there when the biggest dragon of all—the draco nobilis—attacks (Guards!
Guards!). It’s what brings Vimes and her together. (Some people prefer
Internet dating services in their quest for a love connection.) And in
The Fifth Elephant, she keeps her head
when threatened by kidnappers, captured by werewolves, and bullied by
politically minded dwarfs. It’s hard to keep a good woman down.

Speaking of not keeping a good woman down, here we’ve gotta give props
to Cheery Littlebottom, the dwarf who comes out of the closet, if you
will, by admitting that she is a female. She’s the Kay
Scarpetta/Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) of the Watch and
tremblingly places herself in the danger zone when necessary.

Don’t worry. We’re not leaving out Angua, the werewolf on the Watch. She
may look like a helpless female à la Conina and many other heroines in
fantasy fiction (such as Kahlan Amnell in Terry Goodkind’s Sword of
Truth series). But she’s not the type you’d want to meet in a dark alley
or even a lighted one. And like Conina and Kahlan, she frightens most
men. Like Vivian, the werewolf main character in Blood and Chocolate,
she accepts without any existential arguments the fact that she is a
werewolf, and can choose to avoid hunting humans, except in her capacity
as a member of the Watch.

And there’s Ludmilla, another werewolf and daughter of the medium Mrs.
Cake, who with Windle Poons helps save the city in Reaper Man. Doreen
Winkings is another comrade in the fight against the parasitic life
force. While Ludmilla’s existence as a werewolf is denied by her mother,
Doreen is in denial about her own status. She insists that she’s a
vampire simply because she married one. Thankfully, there is such a
thing as therapy.

Don’t discount a kid.

In some Steven Spielberg films and Stephen King novels, kids and teens
help save the day. That’s par for the course in juvenile fiction and
young adult fiction but is not usual in adult fiction. But in Discworld,
you can take your pick among kid or teen rescuers. We’ve already talked
about Tiffany Aching and Roland de Chums-fanleigh. There’s also Nijel
the Destroyer, the painfully thin hero
wannabe who falls for Conina in Sourcery. Nijel may think being a hero
is something you have to read about, but he tries like Keith and
Malicia, who help defeat the rat king in The Amazing Maurice and His
Educated Rodents. And then there are Coin and Lobsang, who act to
destroy Discworld but then help save it once they’re in their right
minds. And who could forget Twyla and Gawain, Susan Sto Helit’s charges
who stand up to the menacing Teatime in Hogfather? Although they aren’t
full-fledged members of the hall of heroes, perhaps they will be
someday, having had Susan as a nanny.

Many adults tend to underestimate or patronize kids, which Pratchett
shows in a number of Discworld books. The wizards learn the hard way
that underestimating Coin is the act of a fool. Lobsang also is measured
and found wanting until his connection to the personification of Time is
discovered. No one makes that mistake twice.

Aim for the assassin.

In Day of the Jackal, the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth, the assassin
(the jackal) earned the grudging respect of the police detective who
tracked him. In The Fifth Elephant, don’t look for warm fuzzies between
Vimes and Inigo Skimmer, an assassin and a member of the ambassadorial
staff. Vimes only tolerates him. Yet, like Moist von Lipwig is for the
Post Office in Going Postal, Inigo’s the right man for the right job: to
help school Vimes on Uberwald political protocol, as well as to
safeguard Vimes and the others. Being an assassin certainly helps in an
area as tough as Uberwald, especially if one has spy work to do. But
like his namesake in William Goldman’s The Princess Bride (Inigo Montoya
the swordsman), he runs afoul of someone truly evil. Montoya had a
better outcome.

Pay attention to Wordes.

No, that’s not a typo. Journalist William de Worde—a man who shares
Terry Pratchett’s former profession—shows the power of the press to
effect change. Oh, and annoy people as well, to which Commander Vimes
and many others can attest. With the help of Gunilla Goodmountain,
Sacharissa Crisplock (his “Girl Friday”), and black ribboner Otto
Chriek, de Worde in The Truth exposes yet another nefarious plot aimed
at deposing Vetinari—a plot with a Man in the Iron Mask twist. And like
other journalists covering wars, de Worde heads for the hot
spot—Borogravia in Monstrous Regiment . His reporting there helps expose
the truth about the war.

De Worde is like crusading real-life journalists Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein, who, in All the President’s Men, wrote about their
experiences covering the Watergate scandal during the 1970s, and
fictional journalists such as Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief (John
Grisham) and the Lone Gunmen from The X-Files and the Lone Gunmen TV
series, whose search for the truth helped save lives but also ended
careers. Life’s all about hard choices. Speaking of hard choices …

Trust a con man.

One of the most unlikely heroes of Discworld has to be Moist von Lipwig,
who makes a living bilking others out of their hard-earned cash. (For
shame!) But he’s the perfect man to outcon the ultimate con artist
Reacher Gilt, whose management of the Grand Trunk costs lives. (See next
chapter for more on him.) Unlike the Joker, who smugly asked, “Who do
you trust?,” in the 1989 Tim Burton-directed Batman, when Moist says,
“Trust me,” you can’t help doing so without fear of losing your shirt.

Countless graphic novels, books, and movies prove that we love a good
hero story and sometimes even an antihero story. In Discworld, you can
be sure to find both.

Who’s Wanted and Why: The Villains, Stooges, and Thugs of Discworld

IN THE DISCWORLD SCHOOL OF VILLAINY

If you make the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List, you know you’ve
done something really wrong—something beyond simply being late with
library books and DVDs or dumping your boyfriend or girlfriend without a
good explanation (although that ranks right up there with kidnapping and
terrorism in the opinions of some).

It should be of no surprise to anyone that international terrorists head
the list, followed by kidnappers and murderers. But if a most-wanted
list were made for sci-fi/fantasy or spy fiction villains and betrayers,
it would include the usual suspects: Darth Vader. Darth Maul. Darken
Rahl. (Hey, that rhymes.) Darth Sidious. He Who Must Not Be Named
(Voldemort) and his Death Eaters. Chired Anigrel and the seriously
twisted demon queen Savilla (Obsidian Trilogy). Smaug. The Borg. The
Daleks and Cybermen (Doctor Who). The Vogons (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy). Dracula. The Forsaken and Shai’tan. Sauron. Saruman. Orcs
and trollocs and goblins
(oh my!). The Joker. Venom. Ras Al Ghul. Dr. Doom. The White Witch of
Narnia. Blofeld. Goldfinger. SPECTRE. Rosa Klebb. Gustav Graves. Le
Chiffre. Prince Humperdinck. Count Rugen. Islington. Vandemar and Croup.
King Galbatorix. Barry the evil mastermind (My Super Ex-Girlfriend). The
sky’s the limit for sci-fi /fantasy or spy fiction villains and
betrayers.

Some villains in fiction are easily spotted, because they’re the
snarling, hysterical kind who burst into Snidley Whiplash laughter
(“Nyeah-ha-ha” or “Ha-ha-ha-ha!”) at the drop of a hat and croon over
their plans to take over the world. (Boris Badenov, anyone?) Terry
Pratchett even makes fun of that notion with the notes from the villain
of Maskerade—the Opera Ghost (Ahahahahaha! Ahahahaha! Ahahahaha!
BEWARE!!!!! Yrs sincerely The Opera Ghost¹¹²) and through comments made
by Dark Lord Harry Dread and his posse, for whom villainy is a
legitimate hazard of the hero’s quest, one that Cohen the Barbarian and
the Silver Horde accept.

Villains are what drive the hero(ine) to up and at ’em. The most
memorable villains aren’t prone to maniacal laughter or spittle-spewing
diatribes. They get quietly biz-ay in their scheduled attempts to take
over the world. After all, they don’t believe they’re being villainous.
They do what they do because they believe they’re right. It’s all a
matter of perspective.

In Discworld, Pratchett will sometimes throw a curve in regard to the
villain. You might start off thinking that someone or something is evil
(such as the dragon in Guards! Guards!) and wind up scratching your head
at the end of the book. Much of the time, however, the villains are as
plain as the nose on your face (unless you happen to be Voldemort in the
movie version of Goblet of Fire, in which case you’re lacking a nose of
sorts).

Yes, the Discworld villains are a special breed—front-runners in what we
call the Discworld School of Villainy—those who could
teach other fictional villains a thing or two about villainy. Before we
get into the enrollees, here’s a handy list of prerequisites for anyone
interested in villainy as a profession. You will need:

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] A good plan or at least a compelling one,
since good has nothing to do with it

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] A will to succeed no matter what the cost

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] An ego the size of Texas, Alaska, or the
continent of Asia

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] A secret weapon

[e9781429934886_img_8728.gif] A broken moral compass

DISC-CLAIMERS:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk. Please note also that even
though Jeremy Clockson helped the Auditors to destroy Discworld, he
can’t be considered a villain, because he probably was not in his right
mind at the time (more probably the left). Plus, since he is also
Lobsang Ludd and helped save Discworld, one act cancels the other.

THE VILLAINS

Human Creeps

There’s a whole slew of ’em: Deacon Vorbis the Omnian Exquisitor (Small
Gods); Carcer (Night Watch); Reacher Gilt (Going Postal); Lupine Wonse,
a.k.a. the Grand Supreme Master of the Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon
Night (Guards! Guards!); Captain Findthee Swing of the Unmentionables
(Night Watch); Duke Felmet and the Duchess (Wyrd Sisters; see also
chapter 5 of this book); Jonathan Teatime (Hogfather); Mr. Salzella the
Opera Ghost (Maskerade); and even the genteel Lord de Worde (The Truth),
just to name a few. They’re like roaches or mice—they breed in just the
right atmosphere. They live and die by their code of beliefs. Those who
dare to stand in their way don’t stand for long.

 

Gilt-edged. With an eyepatch and a cockatoo on the shoulder, Reacher
Gilt may look like a stereotypical pirate à la Long John Silver
(Treasure Island), but he’s never foolish or charmingly drunk like
Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. He’s more
of a business pirate with the success of real-life
early-nineteenth-century gentleman pirate Jean Lafitte; the panache of
Captain James Hook (Peter Pan); and the ruthlessness of Gordon Gekko,
the corporate raider in Wall Street, the 1987 movie starring Michael
Douglas (“Greed is good”), or Captain Barbossa and the squid-faced Davy
Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

Con man Moist von Lipwig even admires the flimflam of Gilt, whose antics
go beyond those of a con artist like Harold Hill in The Music Man.
Gilt’s not small-time like the guys who hustle people in three-card
monte games. He’s strictly a big-time gambler who fervently believes in
“winner take all.” That’s the pirate’s way.

 

The City Watch’s Most Wanted. In the City Watch series, you find plenty
of villains. After all, the job of a City watchperson is to catch
criminals. And what better place to find a criminal than a big city like
Ankh-Morpork? This is where you find your psychotic killers, such as
Carcer (Night Watch), and your assassins, such as Edward d’Eath and Dr.
Cruces (Men at Arms), whose purpose goes beyond the assassins’ code.

Some criminals, like Dr. Cruces, sound so reasonable, you almost want to
invite them to dinner to look at their brochures. (“Yes, I understand
now why you’re willing to kill anyone, including the Patrician, who
stands in your way of putting the rightful king back on his throne. How
can I donate to your cause?”) But others, like the torturous,
calipers-carrying Captain Findthee Swing (he of the rat’s eyes), are
more insidious, like Darth Sidious, the emperor in the Star Wars series
of movies. Swing is like Toht, the Nazi torturer in Raiders of the Lost
Ark, in that he tortures and maims because he loves to do it. And he
hires people just like him to carry
out some of his tasks—others bearing the uniform of authority. (For more
on stooges and thugs, see “The Stooges and Thugs”.) As with Wolfgang,
death is a far better choice, in Vimes’s opinion, than his continuing to
walk the earth. You have to wonder what a good dose of Zoloft or even
Thorazine would have accomplished in Swing’s life.

Lupine Wonse is another villain with a
get-rid-of-the-Patrician-and-get-the-rightful-king-on-the-throne agenda.
He’s of the maniacal laughter caliber of criminal, driven to the edge of
madness by the noble dragon he summons.

Carcer, however, starts on the edge of insanity and keeps on going. He’s
a Jack the Ripper brand of serial killer—another person Vimes would
rather see dead than alive. Vimes barely restrains himself from making
that happen.

But among the most villainous in Ankh-Morpork—at least in Vimes’s
opinion—are the politicians—the ones on the right side of the law; the
ones he can’t prosecute, no matter how hard he tries. (Lords Rust,
Downey, and Selachii—take note.) Many would agree.

 

Twisted Terrors. Jonathan Teatime, or Teh-ah-tim-eh as he prefers, the
twisted assassin of Hogfather, has the same sort of joy the Swing
displays in his work. Even Lord Downey, the head of the assassins and a
man with “no actual morals,”¹¹³ finds him repugnant. But that doesn’t
stop Downey from suggesting him as a possible assassin to do away with
the Hogfather.

Deacon Vorbis, as we mentioned in chapter 4, exudes a kind of rational
evil. He doesn’t get hysterical or foam at the mouth. Watch the master
at work. Vorbis calmly places the tortoise god Om on his back in the hot
sun so that Om will die. Later, he hands someone a harpoon to kill a
porpoise. Now that’s evil. But to Brutha, the
hapless devotee of Om, Vorbis is villainous because he has no real
belief in Om. That is Vorbis’s downfall.

And what of Lord de Worde in The Truth? What a guy. Like Dr. Cruces and
other villains, he plots to replace Vetinari. He belongs to the same Icy
Fathers League as Lycaelon Tavadon, in Mercedes Lackey’s Obsidian
Trilogy, or Darth Vader—someone who could betray his son at the drop of
a hat and not consider anything wrong with that. Worde also is just as
prone to look down on the “lesser races” as is Tavadon. Don’t look for
any speeches from either of them on Father’s or Friendship Day.

Nonhuman or Undead Creeps

The Auditors of the Universe. They may be just gray cloaks (until they
take on human flesh, as they do in Thief of Time), but the Auditors are
a plague on humanity. Orderliness in the universe is their passion.
Unfortunately, humans are too disorderly, in their opinion. And Death is
a continual nuisance to them.

The Auditors are petty bureaucrats, with their penchant for rules and
having things done their way. (Perhaps you’re thinking of the DMV or
some other civic office right now.) They are the “rat king” (see next
section) of the universe with their collective mind-speak and avoidance
of the first person. Think Big Brother (1984 by George Orwell) is bad?
They watch the human drama, not unlike the black-robed Auditor in Samuel
Beckett’s play Not I. They’re so lacking in imagination that the only
names they can come up with after taking on flesh are those of colors
(Mr. White, Mr. Orange).

When they’re not trying to replace Death (Reaper Man), destroy Discworld
(Thief of Time), or arrange for the elimination of the Hogfather and
other personifications (Hogfather), we’re not exactly sure what the
Auditors do. Sweep stars, maybe? Tidy drawers?

 

The Undead and Fairyland Creeps. Angua’s brother, Wolfgang (The Fifth
Elephant), is in good company with the de Magpyr family of vampires
(Carpe Jugulum), the Dragon King of Arms (an old vampire in Feet of
Clay), the Fairy Queen (The Wee Free Men; Lords and Ladies), and Mr.
Slant, the zombie lawyer. In most cases, they’re respectable but
villainous. They’re the kind who send others to do their dirty work.
(Well, Wolfgang does his own dirty work.)

Slant works for such human creeps as Reacher Gilt, Lord de Worde, and
Lord Downey. You can usually find him weaseling people out of trouble or
hiring such thugs as Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip (see “The Stooges and Thugs,”
page 172). He’s like a walking episode of Law and Order (insert the
subtitle of your favorite spinoff), where the criminals sometimes go
scot-free.

While Angua’s von Uberwald clan (the baron and baroness) enjoys the
power and prestige of the werewolf in Uberwald, Wolfgang thinks only of
being at the top of the food chain. Even a vampire like Lady
Margolotta—who has some Godfather tendencies, in Vimes’s
estimation—considers him to be a monster. Ironic, isn’t it? He’s like
the worst of the Bond villains—completely mental.

Back in Ankh-Morpork, the Dragon King of Arms is not only a snob, but a
meddler in politics. In Feet of Clay, he’s content to work in the
shadows, putting the person of his choice on the throne of Ankh-Morpork,
in the vein of Dr. Cruces and the guild leaders. He has an ancient
malevolence on par with many of the vampires in Anne Rice’s Vampire
Chronicles and the Volturi in Stephenie Meyer’s New Moon. That’s why
he’s considered the real villain, rather than the murdering golem. After
all, the golem is an ignorant pawn made by other golems. But the Dragon
King of Arms just screams “megalomaniac.” And anyone who tries to kill
Vimes is just wrong in our book. (For more on the Dragon King of Arms,
read chapter 15.)

The Fairy Queen, like other treacherous queens in literature,
especially the queen in the Snow White fairy tale and the Evil Queen of
The 10th Kingdom, wants a world to control—the default wish list of the
villain as well as that of the Brain of Pinky and the Brain—and has many
elves to do her bidding. She’s beautiful. She’s deadly. She’s
undoubtedly insane. But she’s pitiable, as Tiffany Aching discovers in
The Wee Free Men. After all, isn’t she just wookin’ pa nub?

 

Creepy Animals and Insects. Many fantasy series (Anne McCaffrey’s Pern
series, Christopher Paolini’s Inheritance series, a number of series by
Mercedes Lackey) feature the bond between a human and a dragon. For the
most part, this is a good thing. Not so in Discworld. The summoned noble
dragon of Guards! Guards! acts the part of the wily, but vicious
dragon—more on the Smaug end of the spectrum than on the lovable Saphira
(Eragon), Ancaladar (To Light a Candle), or Ruth (The White Dragon) end.
After all, quite a few deaths take place at her “hands” and she has a
hoard like Smaug. Also, she has a mental link with Wonse and twists his
strings like a maniacal puppet master. But then there’s the matter of
her culinary needs—the usual diet of the marauding dragons. Hint: Lady
Sybil Ramkin fits the profile. (In contrast, Ancaladar eats cattle.) Yet
all of that changes when the dragon meets little Errol. She wanders off
like a lovesick puppy—like the dragon in the first Shrek.

And let us not forget Spider, the rat king of the rat catchers in
Pratchett’s Carnegie Medal-winning book, The Amazing Maurice and His
Educated Rodents. Spider is really eight rats operating with one mind,
thanks to their tails being tied together. Humans are the target of
Spider’s wrath. (We get no respect.)

The idea of creating rat kings by tying rats together by the tail didn’t
originate with Pratchett. There are folktales based on attempts by
humans to join rats together. And a museum (Mauritianum) in Altenburg,
Thuringia, Germany, has the actual mummified remains of a rat king.
(Ugh.)

Speaking of small, vicious animals, who could forget Big Fido, a small
white poodle who just happens to be the crazed leader of dogs in Men at
Arms? (You might be thinking of All Dogs Go to Heaven right about now.
Or maybe that’s just us.) He tries to off Angua and Gaspode—the talking
mongrel. Big Fido believes dogs are superior to all animals (sort of
like master-race thinking). It is only a matter of time before he
amasses a following large enough to take over the city. Unfortunately,
his time runs out.

 

Evil Entities. The Summoning Dark in Thud! and the hiver in A Hat Full
of Sky are the “rat kings” of the supernatural world—a conglomerate of
minds acting as one mind. These entities are considered villainous,
since they tend to take over the minds of people—like the wizard
Sensibility Bustle and Vimes. But the hiver seems, well, pitiable almost
with its plaintive request to die. Still, no one thinks, Wow, it would
be great if the hiver would stop by for a long visit. Even Jeannie, the
kelda who is jealous of Tiffany, pities Tiffany when the hiver gets on
her trail.

The Summoning Dark, on the other hand, is a demonic entity made up of
the desire for revenge. It flourishes in the heightened atmosphere of
Koom Valley as it tries to use Vimes in its quest to destroy. It’s like
something out of The Exorcist franchise of movies. Nasty. Approach with
caution.

And then there are the entities that are named by indefinite pronouns,
such as Them (Equal Rites) and Others (Moving Pictures). Like the Fairy
Queen and her elves, their mission (and they’ve decided to accept it) is
to take over the world. Them, a.k.a. the Shadow creatures, come from the
Dungeon Dimension as do the Others (a.k.a. Things). There goes the
neighborhood … .

Magical Human Creeps

There’s nothing worse than a villain with magical powers. Think:
Voldemort. That’s why an Ipslore the Red, who nearly succeeds in
destroying the Disc, is a particular nuisance even after he’s dead,
thanks to having his essence in the staff given to Coin. He’s like a
demonic spirit who possesses a person and uses him or her as a puppet.
And the evil vizier Abrim causes a mage war that doesn’t help, either.
As Pratchett mentions in Pyramids, “There is no such thing as a good
Grand Vizier. A predilection to cackle and plot is apparently part of
the job.”¹¹⁴ So Abrim is just doing his part to carry on the tradition.

But consider the case of Lilith de Tempscire (a.k.a. Lily Weather-wax),
the fairy godmother and Granny’s “good” sister in Witches Abroad. Is
Lily Weatherwax evil? Well, she makes harmful choices and resorts to
murder. She also tries to force the Cinderella of the story—Ella—to
marry a frog, all for the sake of a happy ending. She’s not tragically
misunderstood as Elphaba, the so-called Wicked Witch of the West (a
tweaked character of L. Frank Baum) is, in Gregory Maguire’s Wicked. And
on par with villains everywhere, she believes that she’s the “good
one”—the one whose actions are for the sake of humanity.

Lilith is an allusion to Lilith, the mythical first wife of Adam,
mentioned in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis. In
that book Lilith is the White Witch, Jadis. There’s a reference to
Lilith in The Alphabet of Ben-Sira.

THE STOOGES AND THUGS

Isn’t it funny how there’s always a stooge for hire whenever a
megalomaniac seeks to take over the world? Unlike the Three
Stooges from the old TV show (and countless movies—okay, they really can
be counted), these stooges are usually tireless wreckers of humanity or
just out for the money, like the pirates of the Black Pearl. But the
ways of stooges make for entertaining reading.

Don’t you wonder what goes through the stooge’s mind when the plan comes
up?

 

Megalomaniac: I’m going to use this virus to kill billions of people.
You will assist me.

Stooge: Cool!

Megalomaniac: We’ll all perish! Every single one of us! Even you!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Stooge: Yeah! Woo hoo!

 

Obviously a screw is loose somewhere. You don’t have to have
intelligence to be a criminal stooge. Having brawn and a willingness to
hurt others are two good prerequisites. That’s why Teatime uses
Chickenwire, Banjo Lilywhite, Medium Dave Lilywhite, Peachy, and Catseye
to help carry out the plan to off the Hogfather. (When we think of Banjo
and Medium Dave, we can’t help thinking of the counting song “Green Grow
the Rushes, O,” which has the lines “Two, two, the lily-white
boys,/Clothèd all in green, Ho.”¹¹⁵)

Although he doesn’t fit the stooge mold (i.e., unintelligent),
student-wizard Sideney helps with the Hogfather plan, to make extra
money. But those who follow Dark Lord Harry Dread (The Last
Hero)—namely, such henchmen as Slime, Armpit, Butcher, Gak, and a troll
that continually says, “Dat’s me”—do.

For Lupine Wonse, there are the Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon Night,
who include Brother Fingers, Brother Doorkeeper, Brother Plasterer, and
others. For Lily Weather-wax, there’s the Duc, who’s
really a frog, and the snake women, who are really snakes, to help her
carry out her nefarious plans. (For more about the Duc and the snake
women, see chapter 13.)

Even if the stooges have some intelligence (like the board members of
the Grand Trunk Company in Going Postal), the villain has to be able to
outthink them and even dispose of them when they become a nuisance. He
or she wouldn’t be a villain if he/she was sentimental, even about a
stooge.

Greed, misplaced nationalism, or religious ideals is also a motivator
for the stooge. That’s why in The Fifth Elephant, we find that Dee, the
king’s “ideas taster,” is used by the werewolves, rather than the
originator of the plan. That’s why Deacon Cusp helps Deacon Vorbis.

Another sort of stooge can be found in The Wee Free Men—the dromes. They
are the dreamweavers, and we don’t mean the 1975 song by Gary Wright nor
do we mean the Dreamweavers of Trudi Canavan’s Priestess of the
White—although Canavan’s dreamweavers can send dreams. They’re golems of
a sort—gray, walking gingerbread men much larger than the tiny
gingerbread man of the Shrek movies (but smaller than the big
gingerbread man in Shrek 2) and certainly malevolent. Dromes are akin to
Morpheus (see chapter 9), in that they provide dreams. But the Feegles
compare dromes to spiders for their ability to weave dreams like webs to
trap their next meal. In a way, they’re like big, bloated Shelob in The
Two Towers and the other giant spiders in The Hobbit.

As for your thugs, well, there’s Chrysophrase, the extortionist troll
thug (Coalface is the right-hand stooge of Chrysophrase). Although
Chrysophrase is an employer and a club owner akin to a mob boss, he’s
still a thug. Who else but a thug would try to bribe Vimes (see Thud!)?

And who could forget the “fun-loving,” elves in Lords and Ladies—the
full-size models—or the wasp-size ones (see chapter 10)? These aren’t
your happy Keebler elves, who sing and make cookies, or the beautiful,
wise Lord of the Rings or Obsidian Trilogy elves. Like
Teatime, these elves are predatory and vicious, the kind who smile as
they kill like the werewolves who like to play “the game” in The Fifth
Elephant. They love to hunt others for sport—a plot element seen in
other stories as well.

And then there are the thugs for hire: art appreciator Mr. Tulip and the
brains of the outfit—Mr. Pin in The Truth—figure heavily in the plot to
get rid of Vetinari (plot #6,000; everyone tries to get rid of Vetinari
or Vimes). You can’t help but think of Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, the polite
thugs in Diamonds Are Forever. And of course, there’s Mr. Gryle, the
banshee thug employed by Reacher Gilt in Going Postal.

And let us not forget the thugs in uniform—corrupt watchmen, a term
that’s almost a redundancy in Ankh-Morpork. There’s Captain “Mayonnaise”
Quirke (Men at Arms, Night Watch), Sergeant Knock (Night Watch), and the
rest of Captain Swing’s sadistic Unmentionables—the SS of Ankh-Morpork.

Like the villains, thugs and stooges usually come to a bad end unless
they agree to betray their bosses, in which case they probably will come
to an end anyway … just like this chapter.

Les Animaux

Animal minds are simple, and therefore sharp … . The whole panoply of
the universe has been neatly expressed to them as things to (a) mate
with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks.

—Equal Rites¹¹⁶

Maybe we won’t catch you ordering Charlotte’s Web or any other cute
animal story (Flicka or Lassie, anyone?) through Netflix. Maybe Animal
Farm, George Orwell’s searing indictment of Russian-style communism, or
Brian Jacques’s Redwall series with its Lord of the Rings–epic style of
animals is more your speed. You know—where animals behave as people and
even wield a sword and other weapons.

While a series like Artemis Fowl may be “Die Hard with fairies”
(according to its author), Animal Farm is Doctor Zhivago with animals.
So, what is Discworld? We consider it Les Misérables with animals. Les
Animaux, if you will.

GIVE US YOUR POOR, YOUR TIRED, AND YOUR WRETCHED

Victor Hugo’s classic story of poverty and redemption might seem like a
far cry from the daily life of a talking dog named Gaspode or an
extremely smelly, old wirehaired terrier named Wuffles—the pride and joy
of Lord Vetinari. But think of Gaspode as Jean Valjean, the beleaguered
hero of Les Misérables, whose crime of stealing bread to feed his family
nets him the unwavering persecution of Inspector Javert. Think of
Wuffles as Gavroche, the kid who rats out Javert. (Remember, Wuffles is
the one who exposes Charlie as the fake Vetinari, thus helping foil the
plan of Mr. Tulip and Mr. Pin.)

Think of Gavin, the wolf who runs with a pack of wolves in The Fifth
Elephant, as Eponine Thénardier, a young girl in love with Marius
Pontmercy, a revolutionary, and dies to save him. We thought of Eponine
because of the love triangle. If you saw the play Les Mis, you know that
Marius loves Cosette, Jean Valjean’s daughter. Well, there’s the
Angua-Carrot-Gavin triangle. What Gavin’s relationship is to Angua
before she arrives in Ankh-Morpork, we can only guess. (And we try not
to think too deeply about that.)

Consider also, the tragic life of Chubby, the stolen dragon in Men at
Arms who … well … explodes. Can’t you see echoes of the ill-used Fantine
who tragically dies in Les Mis?

Now think of Dangerous Beans, Peaches, and especially Darktan of The
Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents as the students at the barrier
fighting in the revolution. Darktan, of course, is Enjolras—the leader
of the student rebels. Can’t you just hear the music swelling? (“Do You
Hear the People Sing?”)

WE’RE FULL OF HOT AIR

Okay. Maybe we’re full of hot air and you would prefer us to get to
stuff like Pet Sematary, the 1983 Stephen King book turned into a movie,
where buried pets and people come back to life and turn evil. (All
right, all right. Maybe you didn’t see that one.) Greebo, Nanny Ogg’s
pet cat, would probably have a starring role. Or how about Amazonian
strawberry poison dart frogs? They’re not in Discworld. We’re just
mentioning them because we think they’re cool.

Maybe you won’t think a comparison to Les Mis so far-fetched if you
recall the barricades built all over Ankh-Morpork in Night Watch and the
songs the flag-waving rebels sing, an allusion to the song of the rebel
students in Les Mis—“Do You Hear the People Sing?”

But we digress. Getting back to Pratchett’s Animal Kingdom, the closest
animal you’ll find to the heroic Lassie (the famous collie) or Rin Tin
Tin (a series of trained German shepherds who acted in the movies during
the 1920s and 1930s—a time when maybe your grandmother wasn’t even
alive) ideal is a dog named Laddie the Wonder Dog in Moving Pictures.
He’s like Lassie and Rin Tin Tin except he was almost designed by Nature
to be in moving pictures—he even barks photogenically! But while he
helps save the day (Good boy!), he has an almost pathological need to be
affirmed.

In Discworld, you won’t find a load of heroic animals that seem as if
they’re self-cleaning. Instead, you find animals full of hot, smelly
air, such as the swamp dragons at the Ankh-Morpork Sunshine Sanctuary
for Sick Dragons started by Sybil Ramkin Vimes. Pratchett talks all
about swamp dragons in The Last Hero and other places, so we won’t go
into that much. What we can tell you is that they’re not like the
dragons you find in the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey (and Todd
McCaffrey, her coauthor son), the Dragon Jousters series by Mercedes
Lackey, the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini, or any of the
hundreds of other series with dragons.

And Gaspode is sort of an anti-Lassie—tough talking and street-wise; not
a puppet of “the Man” like Laddie. (If Joe Pesci could play a dog, he
could probably play Gaspode.) Oh, sure, he helps save the day in Men at
Arms, The Truth, Moving Pictures, and The Fifth Elephant. And he’s
briefly known as Gaspode the Wonder Dog in Moving Pictures. But you’ve
probably never seen Lassie as filthy as Gaspode. And Lassie, alas, only
barks, no matter how many times Timmy asks, “What is it, girl?” (And the
gender thing is another issue.)

And then there’s the matter of Wuffles—a sixteen-year-old dog who likes
to bite people. Not exactly Rin Tin Tin. Yet Wuffles is a beloved pet
just as Greebo is and Gaspode was briefly. But in Discworld, pets are no
more “owned” than people are—at least the smart ones aren’t.

Of Rats and Men

Martin and his father, Luke (guess Luke can’t use the Darth Vader line,
“Luke, I am your father”), are your epic-style heroes of Redwall. No
question about that. You don’t get a name like Martin the Warrior or
Luke the Warrior for knitting sweaters. They’re part of the tradition of
heroic mice, one you find in the Newbery award-winning book, Mrs. Frisby
and the Rats of NIMH by Robert C. O’Brien and The Rescuers by Margery
Sharp. And then there are rats like Ripfang, the pirate, who are the
opposite—nasty, mean—the manner of many rats in fiction. (Many, but not
all.)

Discworld is rat, rather than mice, country. There are the Death of Rats
(see chapter 8), Dangerous Beans, Darktan, and Hamnpork. (And there’s
the ratlike Nobby.) They’re in the Justin sphere of heroic animals,
Justin being the kindly, heroic rat in Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.
They’re proof that the most unlikely being (e.g., hobbits) can save the
day.

Like the rats of NIMH, the Discworld rats suddenly discover that they’re
cleverer than others of their species, thanks to eating
garbage at Unseen University (also the site of Gaspode’s change). The
NIMH rats gained their intelligence through being experimented upon.
Maurice gained his through, well, eating a magically enhanced rat. You
are what you eat.

Running with the Wolves

Down through the ages, wolves have gotten the shaft in literature, what
with Aesop’s fables, Maugrim in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,
and all. Pratchett only partially rectifies that with his inclusion of
wolves and werewolves. Some are good, like Lupine the “mostly” wolf
werewolf in Reaper Man. Some are bad—werewolf-movie bad. We talked about
them in chapter 4. These aren’t your “gender-confused” wolves à la the
Shrek movies.

Gavin—all wolf, not a werewolf—is the typical alpha male—reeking of
“competent power,” as Pratchett describes in The Fifth Elephant. (As
opposed to the wolf Eats Wrong Meat, who probably just reeks.) The
wolves of Gavin’s pack in The Fifth Elephant have a social order akin to
that of the wolves that raised Mowgli in The Jungle Book by Rudyard
Kipling, or the wolves in Jean Craighead George’s award-winning series
about an Inuit girl who lives with a pack of wolves. Although the
Discworld wolves probably wouldn’t raise a human child, they’re willing
to tolerate humans and even snack on them, as Angua warns Carrot in The
Fifth Elephant when he threatens to underestimate them. They’re very
intelligent animals and even have a system of passing on information
that’s just as effective as the clacks.

Cats “You” Later

Whether or not you’re a cat lover, you can find plenty of cats in
fantasy—at least in kids’ fantasy; for example, Erin Hunter’s Warriors
series featuring warring factions of cats.

In Discworld, you’ll find cats with a Pratchett twist. In the
Carnegie medal-winning book The Amazing Maurice and His Educated
Rodents, Maurice is a street-smart cat with a plan. He’s the Discworld
version of Thomas O’Malley, the alley cat in Disney’s The Aristocats.
Maurice could probably out-con Moist von Lipwig, who is a con artist
supreme. He subscribes to the talking animal school of which Gaspode is
a charter member, thanks to the influence of Unseen University (and on
Maurice’s part, a judicious diet of rats).

In many fiction stories, cats are the province of witches. Some are used
as familiars. Nanny’s battle-scarred cat Greebo is a little too
familiar. He’s not like Hermione’s cat Crookshanks in the Harry Potter
series, being of a pillaging personality. But even he gets a comeuppance
when Granny gains a kitten (You) in Wintersmith.

Even Death has a soft spot for cats, as we mentioned in chapter 8. But
it’s doubtful that even he would like Ratbag, the family cat of the
Achings. We’re introduced to Ratbag in The Wee Free Men. He belongs to
the nasty pet cats school of which Si and Am, the sinuous Siamese cats
owned (if a cat can be owned) by Aunt Sarah in Lady and the Tramp, are
members. (Even Greebo, as nefarious as he seems, is more lovable.)

Sisterhood of the Snakes

What fictional wild kingdom could be complete without snakes? But like
the wolves, snakes have a bad rep, thanks to a certain snake in the
Garden of Eden. In the Harry Potter series, you know that Voldemort, who
can talk to snakes, has a huge snake named Nagini. And, of course,
there’s the python Kaa in Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. Even though
Kaa helps rescue Mowgli at one point (mainly so he can have a few
monkeys for a snack), he’s still viewed as sneaky. Not content with just
one snake, Kipling adds three more—Nag and Nagaina, two nasty cobras,
and Karait, another poisonous snake, all of which encounter the mongoose
Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (in the short story of the same name in The Jungle
Book).

In Discworld you find the “iridescent women”¹¹⁷ also known as the
Sisters in Witches Abroad. Granny Weatherwax spots them as the snakes
they really are. You might call them a Sisterhood of the Snakes, like
the Brotherhood of the Wolf. With the pair of them, we couldn’t help
thinking of Si and Am, who created havoc in their household. But unlike
those cats, these sisters meet the “mongoose” that is Magrat, who goes
all “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi” on them (if you’ll pardon our Rudyard Kipling).

A talking snake makes an appearance in Sourcery, when Rincewind is cast
into a snake pit—usually the fate of fantasy heroes, even would-be ones
like Rincewind. (Think of the snake pit into which Indiana Jones falls
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.) And lastly, there’s a rumor that Vetinari
has a snake pit in which prisoners are thrown. But that’s-s-s probably
just a rumor.

Hungry, Hungry Hippos

If you saw Fantasia (the first one, from 1940), you know that Disney’s
“Dance of the Hours” (composed by Amilcare Ponchielli) featured dancing
hippos. Très chic. In Discworld, hippos play an important part as well,
thanks to Roderick and Keith (Feet of Clay) —heraldic hippos of
Ankh-Morpork who also appear on a stamp (Going Postal). Only in
Discworld … . And to think some people prefer lions or dragons on their
coats of arms.

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore

The Corvidae species of birds, of which ravens and crows figure
prominently, are seldom birds people in stories want to have around.
Isn’t it always the evil wizards who have a crow hanging from their
shoulders or use crows to do their bidding (Saruman)? Even in Edgar
Allan Poe’s most famous poem, the raven is a figure of mystery. But
Pratchett, as usual, takes even an archetypal harbinger of doom and has
fun with it. Quoth does come with death, since he is the self-proclaimed
mouthpiece and noble steed of the Death of Rats and seems fixated on
eyeballs. But at least he works for the heroes (the Death of Rats,
Susan).

If you happen to read The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, you read
of another Quoth—Kvothe to be exact. But he isn’t a raven.

The Dogs of War

By this we mean the grimhounds from The Wee Free Men, rather than the
1981 flick directed by John Irvin (based on the book by Frederick
Forsyth). This makes the huge phosphorous-dusted hound in The Hound of
the Baskervilles (Arthur Conan Doyle) look like something out of
Scooby-Doo. Come to think of it, that hound business was a precursor to
the unmaskings in Scooby-Doo. But we digress … . Getting back to the
grimhounds, maybe in your mind you picture the most vicious dog you can
ever imagine—massive, snarling, a super-size junkyard dog with a
hangover. The grimhounds have a resemblance to the hound in Doyle’s
masterwork, with their “eyes of fire,”¹¹⁸ massive build, and black fur.
But the ghostly grimhounds’ flaming eyes are the real thing, unlike
those of the hound in Doyle’s book. And their orange eyebrows? To die
for.

The grimhounds are so fearsome, they get an honorable mention in Going
Postal as one of the items you shouldn’t ask about. Don’t believe us?
Look at chapter 2 of that book.

Amped-up Amphibians

In many fairy tales, frogs or toads talk and turn out to be princes or
some other titled person in disguise. There’s “The Frog Prince” (major
clue there) of Grimm’s Complete Fairy Tales, “The Princess and the Frog”
in The Door in the Hedge (Robin McKinley), and Gogu the faithful frog
friend (guess what he really is?) in Wildwood Dancing (Juliet
Marillier). Unlike the master of Toad Hall in The Wind in the Willows,
the toad in The Wee Free Men wasn’t always a toad. He isn’t a prince,
however—he’s a lawyer. Well, we won’t touch that one. You can insert
your own joke. But another amphibian hits the royalty circuit—the frog
Duc of Witches Abroad. Too bad he’s a pawn of Lily Weatherwax and meets
up with a zombie on a quest for revenge.

Staggering About

The hunting of the white stag has been the key to an adventure in or out
of Faerie in many a story. Think of the ethereal White Stag the
Pevensies discover in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which leads
them out of Narnia. Pwyll, son of Dyyed, a prince in one of the stories
of the Mabinogion, tries to steal a stag from Arawn, a King of
Annwvyn—one of the kings of the Otherworld—and winds up having to serve
him as punishment for his impertinence. Robin McKinley carries on the
tradition in her short story “The Hunting of the Hind,” in The Door in
the Hedge, by showing a hunt that nearly kills a prince.

The stag Tiffany sees in The Wee Free Men isn’t graceful or ethereal.
It’s a wild animal that happens to be part of the nightmarish, wintry
landscape of Fairyland like the Bumblebee women (the big women with the
little wings). It’s also a signal to Tiffany that she’s not in Kansas
anymore.

Unintelligent Unicorns

We’ll end this chapter with unicorns. Picture a unicorn running blithely
through a forest or sniffing buttercups. That’s their usual posture in
books. Pratchett and Mercedes Lackey (well, in her 500 Kingdoms series,
at least) have a similar idea in that the unicorns of their worlds are
rather unintelligent, vapid even. In Lords and Ladies, the unicorn is a
wild beast that can’t talk and doesn’t seem to want to heal anything,
but instead kills like a cornered animal. This is contrary to the way
unicorns are usually portrayed in fantasy—you know, as majestic, magical
talking beasts dripping with wisdom, which kill only when threatened by
evil beings. They would prefer to heal, rather than kill. Like elves,
they’re piercingly beautiful and mysterious. Think of the female
unicorn—you know, the unnamed one (except when she’s given a fake
name—Lady Amalthea) who searched for other unicorns in The Last Unicorn
by Peter S. Beagle (the novel and screenplay) or the one foolish
Princess Lily dares to touch to the detriment of the world in Legend,
the old Tom Cruise movie from 1985. But in Discworld, you don’t want to
get too close to one. And you can’t, unless you’re like Granny
Weatherwax and certainly not Nanny Ogg. (And the answer to that riddle
is … )

In Obsidian Trilogy, the unicorns Shalkan and Calmeren have cloven
hooves and a deerlike appearance, as does the unicorn in The Last
Unicorn. What we know about the unicorn in Lords and Ladies is that he
is huge and heavy like a horse, rather than deerlike.

Hmm. Maybe we can make a case for The Sound of Music, instead of Les
Mis. You know how the Sound of Music song goes, “Do—a deer?” Picture the
unicorn … .

Okay. Maybe not.

It’s Magic

Oh ho, ho, it’s magic, you know
Never believe it’s not so.¹¹⁹

EIGHT WONDERS OF DISCWORLD

There were seven wonders of the ancient world: the Great Pyramid in
Giza, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus (Olympia), the Hanging
Gardens in Babylon, the Mausoleum of Maussollos, the Colossus of Rhodes,
and the Lighthouse/Pharos of Alexandria. They were monoliths to human
ingenuity. Yet only one exists today—the Great Pyramid.

Imagine what it was like to see those wonders. Seeing anything amazing
always begs the question, “How’d they do that?”

A place like Discworld is beyond one of the wonders of the world,
because it is magical and magic is the very stuff of the Disc—part of
the fabric of daily life. And isn’t magic the reason why we read
fantasy—the wonder of it all? So let’s take a sightseeing tour of
Discworld to see the eight magic wonders of that world. Why only eight?
As we said before, eight is an important number in Discworld. Better
bring a camera. You don’t want to miss these shots.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk. Although we picked the
following, you may have a different idea of the magic wonders of
Discworld. Also, their order does not indicate order of importance.

1. The Chalk

The Chalk? you may balk. You may have expected us to say something like
Fairyland, the Fairy Queen’s realm, since Tiffany Aching takes a journey
through it in The Wee Free Men. But Fairyland is part of the Otherworld,
which tries to intrude upon Tiffany’s world in The Wee Free Men. We’ll
get to that in a minute. Meanwhile, we picked the Chalk because at first
glance it might seem like an ordinary region akin to a quaint English
farming community. But consider the fact that Miss Tick talked about the
impossibility of growing a witch on chalk. However, the Chalk not only
produced Tiffany, but Sarah Aching (Granny Aching) as well.

In “Cult Classic,” an essay in Meditations on Middle-Earth, Pratchett
remarked that the land was very much a character in The Lord of the
Rings. He could tell that by the loving details Tolkien added to make
the setting prominent. In The Wee Free Men, Pratchett takes that aspect
a step further by making the Chalk actually rise up against the Fairy
Queen. Like we said, the Chalk is a magical wonder.

2. The Dancers

We’re probably back in your good graces with this selection. The
Dancers, a ring of stones up in the Ramtops, figure heavily in Lords and
Ladies. It’s like Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, or the
Ring of Brodgar in Orkney, Scotland—the kind of Neolithic trilithons in
existence for thousands of years; a place where stories start and
mysteries abound. You can find stone formations like this all around the
United Kingdom. Legends are built around such places.

We can’t help thinking of Celtic mythology, particularly the
Mabinogion—the myths of Wales—which contains stories like “Pwyll son of
Dyyed,” “Branwen the daughter of Llyr,” “Manawyddan the son of Llyr,”
and “Math the son of Mathonwy.” In these stories, white stags run about,
hunted by Welsh kings, and magical wars happen. You know, the usual
Otherworld happenings.

In Discworld, the Dancers are a gateway to Fairyland, which is a
nightmare place, as The Wee Free Men clearly shows. (We have to wonder
if the Dancers are the trilithons Tiffany sees at a distance from the
Feegles’ mound in The Wee Free Men.)

Trilithons such as the Dancers are also “weather computers” operated by
druids in the days before Doppler radar, as we learn in Lords and Ladies
and The Light Fantastic. Belafon, the druid and “computer hardware
consultant”¹²⁰ in The Light Fantastic, operates a piece of rock
“software.” This is fitting, since the real-life Druids were known to
frequent stone circles.

3. Holy Wood

Holy Wood is the Hollywood of Discworld captured in Moving Pictures,
where movie magic happens literally. But like most of the seven wonders
of the ancient world, this is a place you can’t visit anymore. It’s
buried under tons of rubble, like Pompeii in the aftermath of Mount
Vesuvius’s eruption in A.D. 79 or the fall of the mythical cities of
Atlantis or Númenor in Tolkien’s trilogy. Like most places with a thin
line between reality and the “twilight zone” of Faerie (the fairy
world), what you see is sometimes difficult to believe.

This background look at the Discworld “clicks” is all about the silent
movie era, which began just before the turn of the last century and lost
steam in 1929. During this era, such actresses as Theda Bara, Clara Bow,
and Mary Pickford, and actors such as Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Charlie
Chaplin, and Buster Keaton reigned supreme. But since Moving Pictures is
an homage, you can find allusions to several different movie genres as
well as to silent and “talkie” movies, such as Gone with the Wind
(Pratchett’s Blown Away), Lassie, Conan the Barbarian (Pratchett’s Cohen
the Barbarian), The Gold Rush (Pratchett’s The Golde Rushe), The Gold
Diggers of 1933 (Pratchett’s The Golde Diggers of 1457), The Third Man
(Pratchett’s The Third Gnome), The Fog, Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman, King
Kong, Valley of the Dolls (Pratchett’s Valley of the Trolls), Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs, and others.

But beyond the movie magic is the horror of the Chaos-causing “Others”
who want to take over Holy Wood and the world. See, that’s what happens
when the line between reality and the nightmarish Otherworld is crossed
by the unwary (The Grudge/Grudge 2 or any other horror film). Sadly,
many places around the Disc are gateways to the Dungeon Dimension.

The Others are not to be confused with the Chaos-causing “Them” of Equal
Rites—another group out to take over the world or even the Chaos-causing
“Them” that Nanny Ogg uses as a euphemism for the Lords and Ladies (the
elves) in Lords and Ladies.

4. Jason Ogg’s Smithy

A much happier place is Jason Ogg’s smithy. Jason Ogg is part of the
legion of fairy-tale blacksmith/farriers. Amazing things can happen at a
blacksmith’s forge. In Smith of Wooton Major, by J. R. R. Tolkien, a boy
who swallows a fairy star tucked away in a slice of cake later becomes a
blacksmith of incredible skill and a traveler in the land of Faery. In
Spindle’s End by Robin McKinley, Narl is the
fairy prince turned blacksmith—nearly a physical impossibility since
fairies can’t stand the touch of iron. The Brothers Grimm included some
stories involving blacksmiths, namely “The Three Brothers,” in which one
brother, a blacksmith/farrier, is so skilled at his trade, he can shoe
horses even while they were running. In “The Master-Smith,” ¹²¹ a
folktale from one of the collections of Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and
Jørgen Moe (see chapter 1), a blacksmith makes a deal like the one Jabez
Stone (a character in “The Devil and Daniel Webster”) makes with the
devil (who is sometimes known as Death in some versions of the tale) to
become the best blacksmith (and farrier) of all. Although he can’t
duplicate the wonders he sees a stranger perform at the forge, he is
given three wishes from the stranger (who is possibly God and travels
with Saint Peter) to help him trick the devil, and keeps his soul.

As Pratchett mentions in Equal Rites, “Any halfway competent blacksmith
has more than a nodding acquaintance with magic, or at least likes to
think he has.”¹²² Jason Ogg may not be the magic practitioner that
wizards are or his mother, Gytha Ogg, is. But, as we learn in Lords and
Ladies, he can shoe anything—magic in itself. Unlike the master-smith of
that story, Jason doesn’t try to trick Death. He instead keeps to the
code of being the best at anything. And being the best means you have to
keep working at the trade of which you’re the best.

5. Fourecks

Remember The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle (and the movie)—the South
American country where dinosaurs still walked the Earth in a
pre–Jurassic Park way? (Not to be confused with The Lost World by
Michael Crichton, where dinosaurs still walk the
Earth in a post–Jurassic Park way.) And how about The Island of Dr.
Moreau by Jules Verne—where a mad scientist goes gene-splicing crazy by
making animal-human hybrids? And then there’s Lost Horizon by James
Hilton (and the movie) where two men find a Tibetan
lamasery—Shangri-La—after crash landing in the Himalayas. And last but
not least, there’s the ultimate castaway story: Robinson Crusoe by
Daniel Defoe, which inspired the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks and a
volleyball named Wilson.

Fourecks, the so-called “last continent” of Discworld, is a lost world
in transition, part Shangri-La, part Crocodile Dundee (G’day, mate),
part Island of Dr. Moreau and Robinson Crusoe with a touch of Aztec
history and South Pacific, thanks to wizard and housekeeper castaways
from Ankh-Morpork. Mrs. Whitlow can’t seem to wash those men right out
of her hair, but goes for island wear with a flair. The minor god
encountered by the wizards is the Dr. Moreau who makes creatures that
evolve. Alas, the wizards’ utopia crumbles at the first sign of an
argument and danger. But there are no T. rexes, sadly, or
lamaseries—just a version of Unseen University (BU instead of UU). It’s
not Shangri-La, but it’s home.

6. The Library of Unseen University

If you checked out those Librarian movies on cable (The Librarian: Quest
for the Spear; The Librarian: Return to King Solomon’s Mines), you saw a
librarian in a more active state than those at your local branch, thus
proving that a library can hold wonders beyond those in books.

The library at Unseen University is one of the most magical and
dangerous places on the Disc, thanks to L-space and such magical books
as The Summoning of Dragons by Tubal de Malachite, which is a point of
contention in Guards! Guards! and Necrotelicomnicon—an evil book by
Achmed the Mad, a Klatchian Necromancer.
Supposedly, every book ever written or yet to be written appears in this
library. (We wonder if this book is there.) In L-space, creatures such
as the Kickstool crabs and the Thesaurus loiter. The Librarian is the
steward of this realm and one who handles the books like a lion tamer.

We can’t help thinking of Merlin in The Sword in the Stone, with his
magical library of books, again some of which hadn’t yet been written.
The Beast in Robin McKinley’s novel Beauty, a retelling of the Beauty
and the Beast story, has a similar impossible library.

7. The Post Office of Ankh-Morpork

A post office isn’t exactly what you would call a place of magic, not in
our world anyway, where years seem to pass while you wait in line and
the check’s always in the mail. (Maybe that is magic.) But magic happens
at the Post Office of Ankh-Morpork. And we’re not just talking about the
sorting engine created by Bloody Stupid Johnson (see chapter 19). We
mean the mystical link between the Postmaster, Moist von Lipwig, and the
mail. He can hear the letters speak. (But “can he hear the letters sing”
à la Les Mis?)

Moist von Lipwig is no Henry Chinaski, the disgruntled postal clerk in
Post Office, an autobiographical novel by German writer Charles
Bukowski; yet they share the same desire to get out of Dodge. But
Pratchett adds a touch of mythology with Moist’s Hermes-like gold getup,
not to mention the visions Moist sees of the Post Office of the past.
Kind of reminds us of the ghosts Jack Torrance saw in the Overlook Hotel
in The Shining, the 1977 novel by Stephen King, which came out in film
form in 1980 and as a miniseries in 1997. Of course, Jack was going
crazy when he saw the ghosts, and wound up trying to kill his family.
But it brings up a point about atmosphere. Just as being in the hotel
changed Jack for the worse, the Post Office helps change Moist for the
better. Now, that’s magic.

8. The Pyramid of Djelibeybi

You don’t have to hop on a plane and head to Egypt to visit a great
pyramid—not if you read Pyramids. It’s fitting that one of the magical
wonders of Discworld is also a pyramid—the Great Pyramid that Teppic
feels coerced to have built for his late father. (Not to be confused
with the Great Pyramid of Tsort, which is an allusion to the Great
Pyramid at Giza.) Teppic’s pyramid is the pyramid to end all
pyramids—and to end the world, while it’s at it.

Constructing a pyramid back in ancient times normally required thousands
of workers and many years to complete. Case in point, the pyramid at
Giza might have taken a workforce of possibly 100,000-300,000 people ten
to twenty years to build. (Historians aren’t really sure about the
numbers.) But the pyramid for King Teppicymon XXVII is assigned to be
completed in three months with just a fraction of that workforce. How is
that even possible? “Pyramid energy,” Euclidean geometry, and temporal
displacement—the perks of a world of magic. And this pyramid can do what
the pyramid at Giza can do—make a whole country disappear without the
aid of a volcano.

 

 

There you have it—the eight great magical wonders of Discworld. And no
travel arrangements were necessary. Perhaps these wonders will stick
around longer than the Colossus of Rhodes.

A Few Words About Footnotes

A nother magical wonder of Discworld are the tiny notes you find at the
bottom of many of the Discworld novels. If you’ve slogged through a high
school or college research paper, perhaps you thought you’d die if you
had to write another footnote, let alone look at one. Footnotes are not
usually the most interesting items on a printed page.¹²³ But the
footnotes strewn throughout the Discworld novels are among the funniest
footnotes you can find in books. If you miss them, you miss key
information and vital back-story.

Pratchett’s not the only author who has fun with footnotes. Jasper
Fforde, the writer of the Tuesday Next and Nursery Crime series, goes
wild with his. Sometimes characters converse through his footnotes!
Susanna Clarke, the writer of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, also
uses footnotes to help tell the story of the history of magic in
England.

But getting back to Discworld, where else but in the footnotes can you
find the hysterical story of Glod (Witches Abroad), the philosophy of Ly
Tin Wheedle (Mort), or the résumé of Mrs. Marietta Cosmopolite (a former
seamstress, but not a “seamstress,” if you know what we mean) as Moving
Pictures describes? But then, you probably already knew that.

A Hierarchy of Power

Power at a point. That’s what Tacticus said.
And here it’s the one right on the end of Ahmed’s crossbow.

—Vimes to Lord Rust in Jingo¹²⁴

Power. People die for it, vie for it, lie for it. Books are written
about it: How to Win Friends and Influence People—the Dale Carnegie
classic. The 48 Laws of Power (Robert Greene). Power vs. Force: The
Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior (David R. Hawkins). Get Anyone to
Do Anything: Never Feel Powerless Again (David J. Lieberman). We use
PowerPoint on our PowerBooks and take power walks and naps.

If you’re a student of history, you’re well aware that back in the
sixteenth century, philosopher and statesman Niccolò di Bernardo dei
Machiavelli wrote a treatise on power called The Prince.¹²⁵ One doesn’t
have to be a prince to be a mover and a shaker in a town. We looked for
ways his advice seemed to be played out or ignored in Discworld.

DISC-CLAIMER:

Plot spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.

ANKH-MORPORK

A prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win
love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared
whilst he is not hated.

—From The Prince, chapter XVII “Concerning Cruelty and Clemency, and
Whether It Is Better to Be Loved than Feared”

The View from Vetinari’s Desk

Ankh-Morpork—the New York, London, or Shanghai of Discworld—is the
largest city on the Disc. It is the City that Works—a nickname Chicago
bears in our world. (Get it? Chicago Bears? We’re still trying on the
puns.) It is a city where Patricians seldom come in names other than
Vetinari. Oh sure, there have been Patricians before Lord Havelock
Vetinari came to power (Crazy Lord Snapcase, a.k.a. Psychoneurotic
Snapcase; Giggling Lord Smince). But now that he has the position, he’s
managed to hold on to the reigns of power pretty tightly, even after
several assassination or impeachment attempts by nobles and guild
leaders such as Lords Downey (head of the assassins), Selachii, and
Rust. But Vetinari’s the one who established the guild system in the
first place, with its thieves, assassins, alchemists, beggars,
clockmakers, “seamstresses,” and so on. And his training as an assassin
makes him a leader almost impossible to get rid of. Just what the doctor
ordered for Ankh-Morpork.

Vetinari is the Denethor of Ankh-Morpork, a steward who does not sit on
the throne of the city. Not that he would want to anyway,
since it is wood covered in gold foil, as he reveals to Carrot in Men at
Arms. Although he is not loved, he inspires fear the Machiavellian way.
Any genuine despot would do the same thing. His life seems to reflect a
principle found in chapter VIII of The Prince: “A prince ought to live
amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances,
whether of good or evil, shall make him change.”

The way he handles Moist von Lipwig, the con man-turned-Postmaster in
Going Postal—by dangling freedom in front of him and taking it
away—seems to reflect a chapter 5 principle: “He who becomes master of a
city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be
destroyed by it.” In other words, you can allow freedom, but only so far
as you can control it. Vetinari keeps Moist and Vimes on a long leash,
but a leash nevertheless.

Capable Carrot

Carrot Ironfoundersson, Captain of the City Watch and Vimes’s right-hand
man (or right-hand dwarf, according to Carrot), might be that
long-awaited king and thus the most powerful man in the city, but he
refuses to be other than a watchman for the time being. Yet he has the
charisma to unite people, as Vimes and Angua notice several times. He
lives out the chapter VIII principle—the one about not changing. But how
about chapter XVII, the one we mentioned earlier concerning the
inspiration of fear or love? In that same chapter, Machiavelli remarks:
“Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than
feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to
be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person.”¹²⁶
Carrot somehow manages to inspire both.

Vimes Invested

Vimes, as the duke of Ankh-Morpork, is the second most powerful man in
the city, to the chagrin of the nobility. His rank is that of a knight
with the title “Sir” like Paul McCartney, Elton John, Sean Connery, and
… but, sorry, not Terry Pratchett (he is an Officer of the Order of the
British Empire, however). Vimes chafes at being known as “Vetinari’s
terrier.” But he knows which way the power wind blows. And it usually
blows Vetinari’s way.

Within any power structure, a clear chain of command is helpful. So the
chain of command in Ankh-Morpork would go like this:

[e9781429934886_i0028.jpg]

But if you add the Watch, which Commander Vimes heads, the chain goes
like this: (See diagram on the following page.)

In Feet of Clay, Vimes describes himself as an advocate of the people.
He seems to live by a principle found in chapter IX (“Concerning a Civil
Principality”) of The Prince: “[O]ne cannot by fair dealing, and without
injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people,
for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter
wishing to oppress, whilst the former only desire not to be
oppressed.”¹²⁷ While Vimes does not ignore the faults of the people, he
at least knows that, like sheep, they need a shepherd.

[e9781429934886_i0029.jpg]

Dealing with Dragons

Vimes’s belief is in direct opposition to that of the Dragon King of
Arms, who hopes to put a noble puppet on the throne and be the power
behind the throne. Machiavelli could probably take lessons from the
Dragon King, who plays the political game like a chess grand master.
Don’t like the pieces you have? Substitute new ones—those who will do
your bidding. The Dragon King’s “chess board” consist of the books of
family heritage, which he uses to his advantage. This fits with
Machiavelli’s suggestion that a prince study the art of war, described
in chapter 14 of The Prince. With all wars, even those fought behind
closed doors rather than on the battlefield, strategy counts.

The actions of the noble dragon of Guards! Guards! however, seem to
embody a principle found in chapter VIII (“Concerning Those Who Have
Obtained a Principality by Wickedness”): “[I]n seizing a state, the
usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is
necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one
stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily.”¹²⁸ She’s also a firm
advocate of crushing freedom, as Lupine Wonse learned the hard way.

Moist Makes the Most of Matters

And now on to that other branch of civil service: the Post Office. Due
to his crimes, Moist von Lipwig has the reins of power firmly thrust
into his hands by Vetinari. It is either that or be executed. By the end
of Going Postal, he’s not only the Postmaster, but also the head of the
Grand Trunk—the clacks company. Since we’ll have to wait and see how he
does as the head of both (perhaps Making Money, the next installment of
his story published in October 2007, explains that), we can only suggest
this advice from The Prince, taken from chapter VI (“Concerning New
Principalities Which Are Acquired by One’s Own Arms and Ability”): “A
wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to
imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not
equal theirs, at least it will savour of it.”

By the way, the Post Office hierarchy goes like this (Moist’s
perspective):

But from Miss Maccalariat’s perspective, it goes like this:

[e9781429934886_i0030.jpg]

[e9781429934886_i0031.jpg]

Get Rid of Ridcully?

We talked about Mustrum Ridcully, the archchancellor of Unseen
University, in chapter 7. Ridcully is yet another leader who has
maintained power for quite some time, despite attempts to murder
him—murder being the way to gain another level in wizarding circles. The
position of archchancellor of old embodied a principle of Machiavelli
from chapter VII of The Prince (“Concerning New Principalities Which Are
Acquired Either by the Arms of Others or by Good Fortune”): “Those who
solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have
little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop.” How true. Ridcully
seems to buck that tradition. Guess it pays to keep a loaded crossbow
handy.

Dabble Like Dibbler?

A man with his own sort of power around Ankh-Morpork (and other places
it seems) is Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler—the persistent purveyor of the
sausage-in-a-buns that a person eats to his detriment. He is also an
agent to some as well as a former movie mogul, having taken over from
Thomas Silverfish in Moving Pictures.
You know what happens to that career and the groups he manages in Soul
Music. Is he a success? A failure? Although he may seem “to follow the
paths beaten by great men”—the chapter VI principle we mentioned
earlier—no one would say that Dibbler’s abilities savor of greatness.
They savor of someone trying to rip you off.

Keeping Company with Chrysophrase

Speaking of ripping people off, there’s thug “prince” Chrysophrase, who
wears a suit and engages in such activities as money lending at
300-percent interest (the mark of a loan shark) and extortion. He is
chairman of the Silicon Anti-Defamation League—the troll watchdog
committee. No one can deny that Chrysophrase has power. Whether you love
or hate him, he’s a true Machiavellian devotée, one who lives out the
chapter VIII principle we mentioned earlier (“A prince ought to live
amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances,
whether of good or evil, shall make him change”) and others. Unlike
Dibbler, he is a “success” in Ankh-Morpork—an accepted hazard of life in
a corrupt city.

Shine On

Mr. Shine claims to be “the indisputable king of the trolls,”¹²⁹ as we
learn in Thud! But instead of being a rock like shale, Mr. Shine is a
diamond, but more than a “diamond in the rough”—the description for
Aladdin in the movie Aladdin. Diamond trolls become kings. Cream rises
to the top, apparently. But war follows in the wake of the rise of the
diamond troll.

A good chess player studies his or her opponent and learns to anticipate
the opponent’s moves. Mr. Shine studies the dwarfs—the
enemies of the trolls. How does he do this? By playing the strategy game
Thud. This fits with Machiavelli’s notion that “to exercise the
intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions
of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war”
(chapter XIV: “That Which Concerns a Prince on the Subject of the Art of
War”).

LANCRE

Kings and Barons and Witches, Oh My

With Lancre being a principality, the king is where the buck stops.
Verence II, the former fool, is the king of Lancre as of Wyrd Sisters,
with Magrat as his queen in Lords and Ladies. Their word is law (unless
some vampires happen to take over the castle, as in Carpe Jugulum). But
the real power in Lancre, even with vampires around, belongs to the
witches, especially to Granny Weatherwax (see chapter 6), the top witch
in Lancre, a title her close friend and associate Nanny Ogg does not
dispute. So any king worth his salt would get the witches on his side,
as the second Verence does in Wyrd Sisters. (This is a lesson Duke
Felmet fails.)

The witches, like the wizards, adhere to the “a cat can look at a king”
principle. While they may call him “Your Majesty,” they still do as they
please, except when someone foolishly tries to lock them in a dungeon.

Granny is a textbook example of the Machiavellian principle concerning
being feared rather than loved. Having a witch’s hat is the key to
power, as Granny reminds Tiffany Aching as well as any reader of any
book Granny happens to be in.

According to Lords and Ladies, the chain of command in Lancre goes like
this:

[e9781429934886_i0032.jpg]

¹³⁰ But we think the chain of command goes like this even if witches
claim not to meddle:

[e9781429934886_i0033.jpg]

THE CHALK

In Tiffany’s farming community, the Chalk, the baron is supposedly top
man under the king. But the real power belongs to Granny Aching, which
still continues after her death. Even the baron seeks
Granny Aching for wisdom. Now that’s power. And Tiffany is able to
access that power—the power of the land—in The Wee Free Men. With
Tiffany as the only witch around, she assumes the reins of authority,
upon Granny’s death.

[e9781429934886_i0034.jpg]

So in The Wee Free Men, the chain of command is something like this:

In Wintersmith, we learn that in the baron’s home, Roland’s aunts
(Danuta and Araminta) rule with an iron fist while the baron is ill,
thus adhering to the curtailing of freedom principle in The Prince. They
are not successful at cowing Roland, who is a reader of books by
tactical titan General Tacticus and knows all of the secret passages in
his home. Again, we’ll have to wait and see how Roland shapes up as a
leader. Thanks to his hero training, courtesy of the Feegles, we think
he’ll do just fine.

UBERWALD

Those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that
they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune
has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others
have laid before they became princes, they must lay afterwards.

—From The Prince, chapter VII, “Concerning New Principalities Which Are
Acquired Either by the Arms of Others or by Good Fortune”

Uberwald is the place for politickin’ and power-grabbin’, as Pratchett
reveals in The Fifth Elephant. Different factions—vampires, werewolves,
and dwarfs—scramble up the totem pole of power. In Shmaltzberg, the
newly crowned Low King, Rhys Rhysson, exudes more political savvy than a
popular favorite, Albrecht Albrechtson (an allusion to Alberich in the
Ring Cycle—see the end of chapter 5). Judging by the way he (and that
pronoun is debatable by the end of the book) handles Dee and
Albrechtson, he embodies to a degree the principle from The Prince’s
chapter VII quoted earlier, even though his election to the throne is
not unexpected.

The first task the Low King takes to establish a good foundation is to
establish the authenticity of the Scone of Stone, the scone upon which
all Low Kings sit when crowned. Although the scone was made in
Ankh-Morpork, Rhysson manipulates his political rival into
authenticating the scone. A good move.

The true queen of Machiavellian principles in Uberwald is Lady
Margolotta, the vampire who is the Dragon King and Vetinari’s equal in
political genius. As she explains to Vimes, “Politics is more
interesting than blood.”¹³¹ Her shenanigans are like chess moves in a
way, as she moves one piece here (Wolfgang) and another there (Vimes),
but never puts herself—the queen—in check.

When we first meet her in The Fifth Elephant, she’s studying Twurps’
Peerage—the who’s who of Ankh-Morpork—to find out who Vetinari might
send as a delegate. This is the same chapter XIV Prince principle that
Mr. Shine and the Dragon King’s tactics show.

DJELIBEYBI AND BOROGRAVIA

The prince … ought to make himself the head and defender of his powerful
neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful
amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself
shall, by any accident, get a footing there.

—From The Prince, chapter 3, “Concerning Mixed Principalities”

 

Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people
ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only
ask not to be oppressed by him.

—From The Prince, chapter 9 “Concerning a Civil Principality”

In Djelibeybi in Klatch, a pharaohlike king rules in the manner of
Egyptian pharoahs in our world. In Pyramids, Teppic (actually Pteppic)
ascends to the throne after the death of his father. Before abdicating
the throne in favor of his half-sister Ptraci, he even has a dream like
the pharaoh of the Bible—a dream of seven fat cows and seven thin ones
(Genesis 41:17-24)—a dream that seems to come with the job of being the
king. With the kingdom squarely between Ephebe and Tsort, Djelibeybi is
in a perfect spot to influence the political arena of either country.
But as Teppic learns, the first Machiavellian principle described in
this section is firmly in place within the foreign policy of Djelibeybi.
In short, keep each country happy and believing you support them, but
keep them out of your land.

During his travels, Teppic learns about the Ephebian culture: that they
have an elected Tyrant as a leader and are a democracy (or “mocracy” as
Teppic describes it), rather than a monarchy—an idea he hopes does not
catch on.

Both principles above can be seen in Monstrous Regiment, in Borogravia
to be exact, a duchy like Luxembourg ruled by a duke and duchess or,
rather, the Duchess who is believed dead. Borogravia is a country
usually at war with its neighbors. During the war with Zlobenia, Vimes,
as the duke of Ankh-Morpork, winds up in
Borogravia (sent by Vetinari) to “bring things to a ‘satisfactory’
conclusion”¹³² after the Borogravians destroy several clacks towers.
That’s Ankh-Morpork’s way of sticking its fingers in every political pie
as well as demonstrating the first principle above (act supportive, but
make sure no one gets into power that you can’t control). If that means
keeping out Prince Heinrich, the ruler of Zlobenia, well, so be it.

Vimes’s attempts to assess the political climate and end the hostilities
involve curtailing Borogravia’s “freedom” to continue the war with
Zlobenia. But after meeting Polly Perks and her regiment, Vimes learns
what Prince Heinrich fails to learn: to ask the people what they want.

According to Machiavelli, a principality is composed of two groups: the
nobles and the people. A ruler who governs by the will of the nobles
winds up alienating the people. A usurper attempting to take over an
area would do well to avoid alienating the people. Prince Heinrich, take
note.

OTHER HELPFUL POWER PRINCIPLES

To rise in the political sphere, it helps to be an assassin. Vetinari
and Teppic both trained as assassins. In Discworld, being an assassin is
a profession for a gentleman, particularly an upwardly mobile gentleman.
It certainly helps Teppic kill off a pyramid. And it usually helps one
move up the wizard ladder.

 

The view is great from behind the scenes. Carrot, like Lady Margolotta,
knows how to act behind the scenes. Carrot gains Vimes’s social standing
(duke, commander) and has thus far eluded the grasp of those who would
force him to ascend to the throne of
Ankh-Morpork. Lady Margolotta, as we’ve already mentioned, is adept at
moving pawns.

 

Never count on werewolves to get ahead. Dee tries to play the game of
politics and loses badly, having been duped by werewolves. (Isn’t that
always the way?) Even Angua knows that werewolves cannot always be
trusted.

 

Never cross Vetinari or Mustrum Ridcully. They have a strange way of not
dying. Ridcully, usually armed to the teeth even when going to bed,
foils all would-be assassins. And Vetinari is almost immortal in the way
that he refuses to die.

 

Avoid scheming against your employer. Mort, Death’s one-time apprentice,
tries by sparing the life of a princess and thus making “ripples in
reality”¹³³ as everyone in Discworld winds up doing. Alas, that is not
the way to get ahead in a job. He winds up dueling with Death. By the
same token, Lupine Wonse, Vetinari’s secretary in Guards! Guards!, is
less than loyal to his boss when he schemes to depose Vetinari and put a
stooge king on the throne. Wonse winds up DOA.

Albert, the wizard who would prefer to be immortal than die a wizard on
earth, learns the true value of getting ahead: suck up to Death.

 

Never borrow money from Chrysophrase or hire Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler.
In fact, you’re better off not talking to either of them.

Why the Watch Works

A constable was empowered to apprehend “all loose, idle and disorderly
Persons whom he shall find disturbing the public Peace, or whom he shall
have just

Cause to suspect of any evil Designs.”

—The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829¹³⁴

TEN O’CLOCK AND ALL’S WELL?

If you’ve read the City Watch miniseries (Guards! Guards!, Men at Arms,
Feet of Clay, Jingo, The Fifth Element, Night Watch, Thud!) within the
Discworld series, maybe you consider the watchmen the few, the proud,
but ultimately, the inept—a far cry from the forensics experts of CSI
(and its thousands of spin-offs) or other law enforcement agents in Law
and Order (another show with multiple spin-offs). But that’s not so far
from reality, particularly in England and Australia in the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries!

Before 1674, depending on where you were—within the sprawling metropolis
of London or the country—you would probably find the same amateur,
unskilled form of peacekeeping taking place since the Middle Ages. But
after 1674, the duty of keeping the peace fell
upon the shoulders of the justice of the peace—the magistrates. In
country settings, this was probably the largest landowner in the area.
Justices were part of a larger Commission of Peace body. But untrained
constables did the legwork of keeping the peace. After all, there was no
police force as such with rules in place. And the constables were men
from the area who rotated the duty.

The justice of the peace had the authority to hold a trial and carry out
a judgment. Depending on the offense, the sentenced person might be
whipped, placed in the stocks, or fined. Needless to say, justice wasn’t
always served.

In London, justices weren’t the wealthy landowners. They were the
tradesmen—also known as “trading justices”—who received a fee every time
a criminal was brought before them. So, some “administered justice,” as
often as possible—sometimes by inventing reasons to have people brought
before them.

Also, in many of the parishes of London, watchmen were on patrol from
9:00 P.M. until sunrise. Some parishes also hired thief takers—bounty
hunters like Stephanie Plum of Janet Evanovich’s series—some of whom
were thieves themselves (unlike Stephanie Plum)! Before the passing of
the Watch Acts, watchmen were selected from the homeowners in the area
and served for a year. They could question individuals out on the
streets at that hour (“Up to no good? Push off home, you!”), but
couldn’t do much about stopping crime. Also, they were part-timers. They
rotated with men who, like them, had other employment. And there’s
something about not getting paid that puts a damper on one’s enthusiasm.

Constables, during the daytime, had more authority to question and
detain minor criminals. But, alas, they were few and could do little to
deter major criminals—like those of the Carcer (Night Watch) variety.

When Charles I allowed for watchmen to be hired, the low salary kept
away more qualified applicants. Many watchmen were
poor or poorly chosen. Picture a frail, elderly man holding a stick and
a lantern. There’s something about the sight that doesn’t ensure
confidence in the justice system. Unfortunately, many also were corrupt
(like Quirke or Sergeant Knock in Night Watch) and unskilled. (Bet
you’re thinking of Fred Colon and Nobby Nobbs right about now … . )

So, two brothers (half brothers really)—Henry and John Fielding—set out
to set up a system of policing the city and its environs. Their dream
began because Henry Fielding decided not to be the kind of trading
justice he observed. Instead, thanks to his training as a journalist and
a lawyer, he wanted to reform the office of magistrate and the laws
concerning the poor. Having set up his magistrate’s office at Bow
Street, Henry also established a criminal law journal in the
mid-eighteenth century. So, in a way, he was like William de Worde, the
journalist in The Truth and Monstrous Regiment. Henry’s journal later
became known as the Police Gazette.

The advent of the Bow Street Runners—thief takers used by Henry and
later John, who were rewarded due to the criminals they
apprehended—helped in the later establishment of a regular police force.
But during their lifetimes, the brothers could not get the government to
agree on the necessity of having a regularly employed police force.
John’s plan for expanding the role of the Bow Street Runners was
continually thwarted.

THE POLICE: EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE … I’LL BE WATCHING YOU

In the nineteenth century, the Watch Acts (particularly, the
Metropolitan Police Act of 1829) were passed, allowing a tax to be
levied to hire full-time watchmen. Sadly, it took the deaths of eleven
people and the injury of five hundred (the Peterloo massacre of 1819),
after an altercation between soldiers and unarmed civilians at a
protest rally, for the government to see the need for a better-trained
peacekeeping unit. These were London’s first police officers—a group
which Sir Robert Peel, the home secretary at the time (the Vetinari of
his day), helped set up. Richard Mayne and Charles Rowan, the first
joint police commissioners in the formation of the police, are
predecessors in a way of Commander Sam Vimes and Carrot Ironfoundersson.
Ex-soldier Rowan (the Vimes), who was older than Mayne and had military
training, was considered slightly more senior in rank. Mayne, like
Carrot, had a strong sense of civic duty as well as knowledge of the
law.

No longer would these peacekeepers be called watchmen. They would be
patrolmen. But they earned a nickname as well—bobbies, after Sir Robert
Peel. The first police—a group of about three thousand—wore uniforms and
patrolled like Ankh-Morpork’s watchmen.

At the time this book is published, Vimes’s counterpart in the
Metropolitan Police Service is Sir Ian Blair, a man who rose in the
ranks just like Vimes, from constable to commissioner.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYMENT

In Men at Arms, Vimes is forced to bend with the times by hiring
practices represented by significant segments of the population (e.g., a
werewolf, a dwarf, a gnome, and a troll—most of whom moved up the
promotion ladder faster than Nobby). However, as you know, Vimes draws
the line at hiring vampires until forced to do so in Thud! when Sally
(Salacia Deloresista Amanita Trigestatra Zeldana Malifee … von
Humpeding—vampires have incredibly long names) comes on the scene.

The City Watch hiring practices mirror the Race Relations Act 1976 and
the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in Great Britain (acts of Parliament),
as well as such U.S. laws as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and its subsequent amendments and Title 42. Read for yourself:

British Law

Part II: Discrimination in the Employment Field

Discrimination by employers …

(1) It is unlawful for a person, in relation to employment by him at an
establishment in Great Britain, to discriminate against another—

(a) in the arrangements he makes for the purpose of determining who
should be offered that employment; or

(b) in the terms on which he offers him that employment; or

(c) by refusing or deliberately omitting to offer him that employment.

Race Relations Act 1976, 1976 CHAPTER 74¹³⁵

 

U. S. Law

SEC. 2000e-2. [Section 703]

(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—

(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of
such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or

(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for
employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any
individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352) (Title
VII)¹³⁶

In Britain, the Race Relations Acts were passed starting in 1965. But
further revisions were needed, making necessary the Race Relations
Acts of 1968, 1976, and the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Third
time’s the charm, apparently.

Lately, however, with affirmative action under fire in the United
States, reverse discrimination cases have had their day in court in some
states, with demands for the end of quota-hiring systems, especially in
regard to promotions on the force. It will be interesting to see whether
the hiring quotas will come under fire in Discworld as well.

In the meantime, the Watch keeps on ticking.

Ripped from the Headlines?

I f you watch the original Law and Order and its trillions of spin-offs,
you know that their cases are “ripped from today’s headlines.” In other
words, they mirror many real-life cases.

While the news hasn’t featured any golem or werewolf killings (at least
to our knowledge), there have been real-life criminals who could have
served as inspiration for the criminals the Watch tries to apprehend.
For instance, such serial killers as Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, and
John Wayne Gacy were the “bogeymen” who haunted police just as
double-murderer Carcer has haunted the Watch.

Although there have been serial killers who killed more people, Jack the
Ripper remains larger than life because he was never caught or
identified, unlike Carcer. He (and police aren’t entirely sure that only
one person was involved) operated in Whitechapel in 1888, killing five
prostitutes (possibly more; again, the police
aren’t sure of the number) in a grisly way that gained him his nickname.

These real-life killers helped spawn such twisted fictional serial
killers as “Buffalo Bill” of The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris
(the book; the 1991 movie screenplay was by Ted Tally).

Time Waits for No One

GOT THE TIME?

If you were in, say, Armethalieh in Mercedes Lackey/James Mallory’s
Obsidian Trilogy series, you’d measure time by bells (“See you in half a
bell, dude”), specific days (Light’s Day), or by wars and epochs (the
time of Great Queen Vielissiar Farcarinon; the Great War). In other
fantasy series, time is regulated in a similar way (the Third age of
Middle-earth and the calendar according to the “Shire-reckoning” of
Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings).

In our world, we measure time by ages and eras (Ice Age, Napoleonic era,
Victorian era), the Gregorian calendar (rather than the Julian calendar
named after Julius Caesar), B.C.-A.D. demarcations (thanks to Venerable
Bede, an eighth-century monk scholar who first used A.D.), and by how
long we have to wait in line at Starbucks or the grocery store (“That
took ages!”).

In Discworld, there’s a hodgepodge of ways to measure time.

Calendars and Almanacs

Societies of our world have differing calendars (Gregorian, Hindu,
Chinese, Japanese) in which the names of months or even the number of
days in a month vary. But in a place like Discworld, where centuries and
years are marked by animals, food items, or inexplicable terms (the
Century of the Fruitbat, the Year of the Intimidating Porpoise, Century
of the Anchovy, the Year of the Impromptu Stoat, Third Ning of the
Shaving of the Goat), and the months have such names as Grune, Ick,
Spune, and Offle, you’ve got to expect some weirdness.

The naming of years and centuries in Discworld reminds us of the Chinese
calendar, a calendar with a sixty-year cycle based on the moon phases,
the sun, and conjunctions of planets. As you know, in China the years
follow a cycle of animal names (year of the dragon, year of the ox).
You’ve probably seen a chart of them on a placemat wherever you go for
dim sum. And although some of us born in years like the year of the rat
could wish that the year bore the name of a cooler animal (such as the
year of the tiger), it certainly beats being born in the Year of the
Impromptu Stoat.

Terms like the Third Ning, although made-up, remind us of the different
dynasties in the history of China—part of the era/epochbased way of
measuring time.

You probably know a year in Discworld can last for eight hundred days
and runs through eight seasons, rather than the usual four. (If you
don’t know, you do now.) Imagine what you’d do with all of that time.
Take two summer vacations?

Almanacs also record the moon phases. Poor Richard’s Almanack, developed
by Benjamin Franklin, lists the times of sun and moon risings and
planetary configurations. In Discworld (especially the Chalk and the
Ramtops), an annual almanac called the Almanack And
Book Of Dayes (Equal Rites, Lords and Ladies, The Wee Free Men) is used
to gauge the weather and serves as bathroom tissue. Quite handy.

Holidays and Special Days

Our holidays and special days tell us a lot about who we are as a people
and what we believe in. We celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa,
Martin Luther King Day, Kasmir Pulaski Day (a Chicago holiday), New
Year’s, Groundhog Day, Valentine’s Day, and hold events like Oktoberfest
and elections. In Discworld, they also celebrate New Year’s, along with
such holidays as Hogswatch, Soul Cake Tuesday, and Fat Lunchtime—like
Fat Tuesday in our world. And then there are Troll New Year, Chase
Whiskers Day, and Sektoberfest, a two-week event involving a beer
festival, like Oktoberfest. Pratchett describes these and other holidays
in Terry Pratchett’s Discworld Collector’s Edition 2005 Calendar and
Discworld’s Ankh-Morpork City Watch Diary.

In Discworld, certain rituals help mark the seasons, holidays, and such
special occasions as weddings. There’s the Morris dance, which comes
from the traditions of the British Isles. In our world, the Morris is
danced at the beginning of spring and summer. It’s been around since at
least the fifteenth century. Seven dancers, usually male, wear white
clothes, bells, and clogs. In Wintersmith, the usual Morris dance occurs
in May, to usher in the summer; and in Reaper Man, it ushers in the
spring. As we mentioned in chapter 5, Jason Ogg and Lancre Morris men
gather to dance for the king’s wedding on Midsummer’s Eve. But then
there’s the Dark Morris—a Pratchett creation. Danced without bells, it
ushers in the winter in Wintersmith.

The Time of Your Life

Another way of measuring time is by the lifetimer—the hourglass that
measures a life. Death carries one for each person he visits who is
about to die. The lifetimer is a symbol of the mortality of man. As the
Romans would say, “Memento mori”—“Remember that you are mortal.” This is
reminiscent of the grim reminder of mortality in Genesis 3:19, “For dust
you are and to dust you will return” (New International Version). But
the lifetimer used by Wen the Eternally Surprised (for more on him, keep
reading) in Thief of Time grants time to the person to whom it is given.

The Discworld Time Lords: The Monks of History

If you’re a fan of the Doctor Who TV series, one that has been around
since the 1960s, you know that the Doctor is a Time Lord from
Gallifrey—someone able to travel back and forth through time. He’s the
last of his kind. So, why’d we bring him up? Because of the Monks of
History in Discworld. They are time lords, in a way—the ones who monitor
and shape time. Their existence is top secret. But the people of
Discworld feel the effects of their constant vigilance. (Maybe you’re
thinking of the Men in Black right about now … )

In the creation of the Monks of History, you can find a hint of Eastern
religions. There’s the great Lu-Tze the Sweeper, a follower of the Way
of Mrs. Marietta Cosmopolite and master of déjà fu—using time as a
weapon, rather than, say, kung fu. Lu-Tze, who appears in Night Watch,
Thief of Time, and Small Gods, reminds us of Zen master Lao-tzu, writer
of Tao Te Ching, and blind Master Po, the Shaolin monk who trained Kwai
Chang Caine in the 1970s TV series Kung Fu.

Other members of the order include Marco Soto—the monk who finds
promising novice Lobsang Ludd; the Master of Novices; the Abbot (with
his “circular aging,” a phrase meaning reincarnation); chief acolyte
Rinpo; and Qu, a monk inventor/weapons master like Q in the James Bond
series.

Instead of a TARDIS (the Doctor’s police box/time travel machine—a
sentient machine the initials of which stand for “Time and Relative
Dimension(s) in Space”), a time machine à la H. G. Wells, or a souped-up
DeLorean used by Dr. Emmett Brown in Back to the Future, the monks’ mode
of time travel is the portable procrastinator, which slices time. (More
on them in chapter 19.) As they slice, the monks get to Zimmerman
Valley, a time-slicing state that can’t simply be calculated by a
velocity formula like:

[e9781429934886_i0035.jpg]

With Zimmerman, we can’t help thinking of a cross between Silicon Valley
and Dean Zimmerman, a Rutgers professor who wrote a paper with the
heading “Defending an ‘A-theory’ of Time,” which we saw on the Internet.
Undoubtedly a coincidence.

Perhaps it’s only fitting that Wen the Eternally Surprised, founder of
the Monks of History, and the personification of Time are the parents of
Lobsang Ludd. It takes time to make time.

On the monastery grounds, you find the Mandala, sands showing the
currents of time. This concept didn’t originate with Pratchett.
According to Hindu beliefs, the Mandala is a sand graph of the universe,
one used for purposes of contemplation. We would prefer to contemplate a
box of Thin Mints and a stretch of white sand in Jamaica. But that’s
just us. (For more on the Mandala, see chapter 19.)

But Is It … Art?

STATE OF THE ART

Years ago (okay, I will admit it was during the early 1980s; yes, I’m
that old) during my senior year at Northwestern, I [Linda] took a
drawing class taught by late Chicago artist Ed Paschke, one of the
professors at NU. In between sessions involving sketching unclothed
models—sessions I giggled through—our class took a tour of some of the
north side art galleries in Chicago. In one gallery, a young man proudly
exhibited his sculpture (I’m not sure what else to call it) to his
adoring public, one of whom apparently was his patroness, a tiny elderly
woman in a fur coat who looked as if she dripped money.

His sculpture consisted of a paint roller standing in a paint tray. He’d
set the roller on fire. Why, I don’t know. For the effect, maybe? While
it burned merrily, his patroness beamed. I could only gawk and wonder,
Is that … art? He seemed to think so. I wondered how much his patroness
had shelled out for him to create that … thing, or how much (if
anything) he would charge for it. Judging by a nearby wall
filled with other pieces of … art consisting of three large sticks
nailed together in varying criss-cross shapes and bearing price tags in
the hundreds of dollars, I would guess a great deal of money.

The question But is it art? comes up a lot in the Discworld novels.
After all, numerous art pieces adorn the museum that is Discworld. Mr.
Tulip, one of the thugs hired by the zombie lawyer, Mr. Slant, on behalf
of Lord de Worde (for more about them, see chapter 12) provides a lesson
in Discworld art appreciation in The Truth. I’ve taken some of his
advice, and that of other art connoisseurs to heart, to explore the
state of the arts in Discworld.

 

Check out the brush strokes. I’ve never been to the Musée du Louvre—the
home of some of the most well-known pieces of art in the world, so I
have to rely on the witness of others, not to mention a viewing of The
Da Vinci Code. During a trip to Paris in the mid-1990s, my older brother
Chris and sister-in-law Lisa stood in a really long line at the Louvre
to see Leonardo’s Mona Lisa. They told me they were impressed by the
sheer age of the painting. (They didn’t bring back a T-shirt, though.)

The Mona Ogg, painted by Leonard of Quirm, is, of course, a parody of
the Mona Lisa, with artist/engineer Leonard acting as the Leonardo da
Vinci of Discworld. If you’ve seen the cover of The Art of the
Discworld, you’ve seen the Mona Ogg, which supposedly was inspired by a
young Nanny Ogg. But Woman Holding Ferret by Leonard of Quirm is an
allusion to Leonardo’s Lady with an Ermine, painted in 1485. (Speaking
of Leonardo, The Koom Valley Codex mentioned in Thud! is an allusion to
The Da Vinci Code.)

Theme-wise, Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze by Caravati
(an allusion to Italian Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio
perhaps?) reminds me of the ballerina pictures by Impressionist
painter/sculptor Edgar Degas, including Three Ballet
Dancers, One with Dark Crimson Waist, and Three Dancers in Violet Tutus.
Of course, Caravaggio was known for paintings with such simple
descriptive names as Boy Bitten by a Lizard and Boy with a Basket of
Fruit. Charming.

The Battle of Ar-Gash by Blitzt (like blitz) seems to be a parody of
Leonardo da Vinci’s Battle of Anghiari (1503-6). The Battle of Koom
Valley by Methodia Rascal, a huge painting that hangs in the Royal Art
Museum in Ankh-Morpork in Thud!, is reminiscent either of of paintings
by Jan Matejko, a nineteenth-century Polish painter known for battle
scenes such as the Battle of Grunwald, or an eighteenth-century American
artist John Trumbull who, like Matejko, was known for military figures
and battle scenes, including the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of
Princeton, The Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, or The Death of
General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Trumbull worked during the
time of the American Revolution and later.

Waggon Stuck in River by Sir Robert Cuspidor reminds me of the Haywain
triptych by Hieronymus Bosch in 1500-15. Whether it was actually
inspired by Bosch’s work is anybody’s guess.

Man with Big Fig Leaf by Mauvaise reminds me of the fig-leaf controversy
surrounding works by the famed Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo
di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (Michelangelo to his friends). Daniele
Ricciarelli (a.k.a. Daniele da Volterra), a painter and sculptor,
painted a fig leaf over a certain part of the male anatomy in
Michelangelo’s fresco The Last Judgment during a time when nudity in
paintings was considered a no-no.

 

Watch out for fakes. In the 1966 movie How to Steal a Million, starring
Audrey Hepburn, Peter O’Toole, and Charles Boyer, Audrey played Nicole,
the beleaguered daughter of an art forger (Charles Bonnet, played by
Hugh Griffith) who paints like van Gogh and had a father who sculpted in
the style of Benvenuto Cellini—the sixteenth-century sculptor/painter
known for his
Perseus sculpture and his Diana of Fontainebleau bronze figure. The
conflict begins when Charles sells his “Cellini” Venus—which was made by
his father—to a museum, claiming to be an art collector. Audrey
convinces O’Toole’s character—Simon Dermott—to help her break into the
museum to steal it, to avoid having her father revealed as a forger.

The Cellini of Discworld might be Scolpini—a sculptor mentioned during
Mr. Tulip’s art discussion in The Truth. We don’t actually see
Scolpini’s work, but we’re told how to spot a real one and the fact that
anyone could steal the piece Tulip views. Shades of the plot to How to
Steal a Million.

Remember the Chicago art gallery pieces mentioned earlier—the twigs and
the paint roller? In Thud! two pieces by Daniellarina Pouter brought
back memories for me: Don’t Talk to Me About Mondays, which looks like a
pile of rags, and Freedom—a stake with a nail in it. Beauty is indeed in
the eye of the beholder.

 

Pay attention. Leonardo da Vinci’s studies on the perception of the
human eye and the effects of light changed the way that painters viewed
their craft. He paid attention to the design of the human body and took
into account what the eye really sees: how much color close up and at a
distance; how the form/shape of the eye (with all of its parts) affects
its overall function, particularly in gauging the proportions of an
object. This helps a painter correctly depict limbs on people in
paintings. Foreshortening happens when the artist doesn’t take into
account what his or her eye is really seeing.

We can’t really see a painting like Three Large Pink Women and One Piece
of Gauze unless an artist like Paul Kidby draws it, so it’s hard to
gauge whether the artist, like Leonardo da Vinci, is a student of the
eye’s form and function. Thief of Time does reveal that The Battle of
Ar-Gash by Blitzt features a striking use of light. Perhaps Leonardo
would have been pleased.

 

What’s music to some is only so much noise to others. Let’s turn now to
the world of music—an art form as varied in Discworld as it is in our
world. Classical—Doinov’s Prelude in G is mentioned in Maskerade, and
Überwald Winter, an opera the Wintersmith loves, in Wintersmith;
pop—“music with rocks in” is described in Soul Music . There’s ethnic
music—“Gold, Gold, Gold,” a dwarf refrain (Feet of Clay); and bawdy
comic songs—“The Hedgehog Song.” And then there are the songs with a
patriotic twist, such as “Carry Me Away from Old Ankh-Morpork,” “I Fear
I’m Going Back to Ankh-Morpork,” and “We Can Rule You Wholesale”—the
Ankh-Morpork civic anthem. Music to stir your soul and conscience.

Everyone in Discworld has an opinion about music. In Soul Music, which
details the musical career of Imp y Celyn—a.k.a. Buddy Holly (an obvious
allusion)—the question is whether music with rocks in is a legitimate
form of expression. (According to the Guild of Musicians, the answer is
no, unless they can profit by it.) Well, it is an issue that causes a
lot of trouble for Discworldians. This subject has been long debated,
since the early days of rock, back when the real Buddy Holly was alive,
and continues even today with regard to rap.

And of course, Granny has an opinion every time Nanny tries to sing “The
Hedgehog Song.” (See Witches Abroad.) Is it art? Is “The Hokey Pokey”?
It all depends on what you like.

The same argument can be made for the Discworld series. Some may balk at
the parodies and puns. “But is it art?” they ask. If you’re reading this
book, we think you know the answer to that question already.

Terry Pratchett: Titan of Technomancy

Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the
machine of war with the sword and the spear
and the iron fist of the orc.

—Saruman in The Two Towers¹³⁷

GADGETS AND WIDGETS

Buzz through a novel by Michael Crichton, Tom Clancy, or Clive Cussler
and you’ll usually find enough gizmos to run or destroy a small planet.
These are your techno-thriller writers. But would you place Terry
Pratchett in that group? You would if you read the Discworld novels
closely enough. They’re all about the gadgets.

Technology shows the advancement of a civilization. Some would argue
that it also shows its imminent destruction and separates the haves from
the have-nots. Whatever the case may be, technology reveals where we are
at as a society.

So, what about Discworld? Who would’ve thought that a world without
computers or TV, and with watchmen patrolling with bells, would have any
kind of technology? But it does. There’s enough technology to almost
rival a Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton novel. No, we’re not drunk. Think
of The Flintstones, the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the 1960s, which
featured a prehistoric setting but technology akin to the 1960s—hence
the car run “through the courtesy of Fred’s two feet” as the closing
song of each episode goes. In Discworld, technology is what Pratchett
calls technomancy.

First, let’s look at some of the inventors.

Inventors

Many of us take for granted the labor-saving devices we have, such as
the computer, the DVD, the microwave, Ginsu knives, or that thing you
throw in the microwave that helps you hang and cook bacon. (You know.
That thing.) But they all came from the brain of someone—sometimes the
kid just down the street or in your own home, the one who dreams of
winning the science fair. Henry Ford, Benjamin Franklin, Mary Phelps
Jacob, George Washington Carver, Sara Goode, Thomas Alva Edison,
Leonardo da Vinci, and many others left a legacy of innovation.
Discworld has several inventors, the most well known of which are
Leonard of Quirm and Bergholt Stuttley (Bloody Stupid) Johnson. Judging
by Johnson’s inventions, his nickname seems apt.

 

Leonard of Quirm. Leonard da Quirm or Leonard of Quirm is the Leonardo
da Vinci of Discworld. Naturally. He’s a gentle genius with an amazing
knack for inventing killing machines, including the gonne (Men at Arms)
and flying machines, such as a flappingwing-flying-device (Men at Arms)
reminiscent of the ones Leonardo da Vinci (see sidebar here) and
Daedalus (the artist/inventor
from Greek mythology) invented. Alas, he’s terrible at naming them. He’s
so dangerous, he has to be locked up in the Patrician’s Palace for the
good of humanity.

 

Bergholt Stuttley (Bloody Stupid) Johnson. Johnson, an inventor and
landscape gardener, parodies Lancelot (Capability) Brown, the renowned
eighteenth-century British landscape gardener whose parks decorated
England. Although Johnson doesn’t actually appear in any of the
Discworld books, being dead and all, his legacy is described. He has a
kind of genius, too—a genius for errors. In other words, he’s
IN-capable. (Ha, ha!) His inventions, for instance the sorting engine in
Going Postal, turn out flawed but still brilliant in other ways.
Although this machine was designed to sort mail, it winds up affecting
the space-time continuum. Not something you’d want at your local post
office—or maybe you would.

 

 

Okay, with that said, let’s get on with the stuff.

Communication Pieces

The clacks. Whenever they’re not queuing up at the Post Office, sending
pigeons, or consulting Mrs. Cake’s crystal ball, the Discworldians send
messages to one another via the clacks—a variation on the telegraph and
also the semaphore (optical telegraph) network, which has been in place
in our world for, oh, a couple hundred years, especially in France,
thanks to semaphore stations set up by French engineer Claude Chappe
back in the late eighteenth century.

If you read Going Postal, you know that Adora Belle Dear-heart’s father,
Robert, is the one who helps develop the clacks
and the Grand Trunk. Unfortunately, he is rooked out of the company by
embezzlers and Reacher Gilt. (More on Gilt in chapter 12 .)

The clacks system also involves c-mail like the Internet’s e-mail. How?
We’re not sure. It just does.

 

Speaking tubes. In the Hogfather, Lord Downey makes use of a speaking
tube. In this phoneless era, this is undoubtedly the receiver
/microphone to an intercom such as those of the late nineteenth
century—the kind used to communicate from one room to the
next—cutting-edge technology back in the day. (You can see these in use
sometimes in old TV shows.) Sometimes you had to blow into them (or at
least people thought you had to) for sound to carry through. Even today,
with technology so much more advanced, you still see people blowing into
microphones and asking, “Is this thing on?”

 

Dis-organizers/PDAs and Iconographs. Vimes has a number of organizers,
or Dis-organizers as they are referred to, Dis being an allusion to the
name of a city in Dante’s Divine Comedy. Unlike the organizers before
PDAs such as Palm Pilots and BlackBerry products came on the scene,
Vimes’s Dis-organizers are powered by tiny imps. (More about them in
chapter 10.) He starts off with the fifteenfunction imp-powered
Dis-organizer—a gift from Sybil (Feet of Clay). In Thud! Vimes gets the
Dis-Organizer Mark Five, the
Gooseberry[e9781429934886_img_8482.gif]—another imp-powered product. We
don’t have to tell you that this is an allusion to the BlackBerry and
iPod/iTunes (Pratchett’s iHUM[e9781429934886_img_8482.gif]). But we did.

As for the iconographs—the magic cameras of Discworld that Pratchett
made up—the imps run them as if they were computer chips. Like
iconography, which involves the painting of religious icons, the
iconograph involves recording images by painting instead
of recording them on film. If you’ve seen The Flintstones, you know this
is the way of many of that series’ labor-saving devices. Wilma’s camera
might simply be a bird painstakingly pecking a picture on a small piece
of marble.

Timepieces

As we mentioned in chapter 17, the monks of history use procrastinators.
These devices store and release time. Many are stationary, but some are
portable. They differ from the time machine used by the Time Traveller
in H. G. Wells’s 1895 novel The Time Machine, or the DeLorean, the 1980s
car that runs on plutonium in the Back to the Future trilogy, in that
you can’t program it to go to a specific time or place and appear there
instantly. Using portable procrastinators enables Lobsang and Lu-Tze to
travel around Ankh-Morpork once time had stopped. Handy when you want to
avoid traffic.

Another innovative timepiece is the great glass clock Jeremy Clockson
builds in Thief of Time. It uses crystals and the cosmic quantum tick
(Newton’s tick of the universe) to measure time. But because it also
destroys the universe (you see now why Jeremy has an Igor working for
him), we can’t see the marketable value of such a timepiece. A Rolex is
preferable.

Qu, the inventing monk who is an allusion to the Q of the James Bond
series, talks about yet another timepiece—an exploding Mandala. The
Mandala—“colored chaos” as Pratchett refers to it in Thief of Time¹³⁸—is
a roomful of sand, but not one in which you’d set a toddler to play.
These are the sands of the universe according to Hindu beliefs—thus far
more potent than the sands of
the timekeepers Death uses. Exploding Mandala is exploding sand—sort of
like having time blow up in your face.

Other Magical Items

The wizards have their hands in the technological stew with the
omniscope (Going Postal)—a magical mirror—and Hex, a “thinking” machine
Ponder Stibbons monitors, which controls thaumarhythms. With Hex, we
can’t help thinking of the old-fashioned computers of the 1950s and
1960s—the ones that used to take up a whole room and spit out keypunch
cards. Gone are those days, since the invention of the personal
computer. He also reminds us of K9, the robot dog who was a rolling
fount of information in the Doctor Who series.

The magic mirror is a staple of fairy tales. Consider the “mirror,
mirror on the wall” of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and new tales
such as Fairest by Gail Carson Levine. Lily Weatherwax uses mirror magic
in Witches Abroad, just as the Evil Queen did in The 10th Kingdom.

WEAPONS AND WARFARE

If you saw any of the Lord of the Rings movies, you saw some of the
weapons or machinery ancient civilizations might have used in times of
war (the trebuchet, bows and arrows, the crossbow, the battering ram,
the sword). Fancy.

If you’re a Clancy aficionado, you’re used to major machines of war,
such as tanks, guns, fancy ammo, chilling chemical weapons, and nukes
aplenty. Well, a whole arsenal of weapons is mentioned throughout the
Discworld series, especially in the City Watch books. After all, the
watchpeople come armed with a truncheon, sword, and a crossbow.

Many of the weapons used by the Watch were developed by
Burleigh and Stronginthearm. Of course, when we read about Burleigh and
Stronginthearm, we thought immediately of Smith & Wesson, the famous
U.S. gun manufacturing company founded by Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson
back in 1852. Burleigh and Stronginthearm make the Discworld weapons of
choice—crossbows such as the ominous Streetsweeper or the Shureshotte
Five mentioned in Jingo. If Dirty Harry, the magnum-carrying police
officer popularized in the 1970s by Clint Eastwood, existed in this
series, he would probably carry either one of those or the Locksley
Reflex 7 crossbow (reminiscent of Robin Hood’s name—the Earl of
Locksley), also mentioned in Jingo.

On an armory visit in Men at Arms (a very appropriate title), Nobby
Nobbs finds several “toys,” which include the glaive, a siege crossbow,
and a morningstar. If you’re up on medieval weapons, you know that a
glaive is a pole weapon—a blade with a single edge attached to a pole. A
morningstar is a macelike club with spikes. Handy for crowd control. The
“‘Meteor’ Automated Throwing Star Hurler” is, of course, an allusion to
the throwing stars or hira shuriken that ninjas use—thin-bladed metal
stars.

We already mentioned the gonne—Leonard of Quirm’s weapon of destruction.
There are other weapons: the clong-clong, dakka, the pika, and the uppsi
of the Dojo of the Tenth Djim mentioned in Thief of Time. The
clong-clong could be nunchaku or nunchucks—the two sticks chained or
roped together. The pika could either be an allusion to the pike—the
spearlike medieval weapon—or one like the feathered spear wielded by Shu
Lien in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The uppsi could be a throwing
star, while the dakka stick could be a tonfa—a wooden shaft about two
feet long with a handle. Usually a person wielding the tonfa has a pair.
Or they could all be made up by Pratchett. He does that, y’know.

Of course, chocolate proves to be the best weapon of all, one
used against the seemingly invincible Auditors in Thief of Time. It also
beats depression, too. It may not be high tech, but it gets our vote for
best weapon.

The Inventive Mind of Leonardo da Vinci

The constituent parts of nature are finite, but the works that the eye
commands of the hands are infinite.

—Leonardo da Vinci¹³⁹

It pays to have keen observation. While Leonardo is known for lacking a
university education, he made up for it by an irrepressible curiosity.
Could a man fly like Daedalus and Icarus? Sure. All you need is the
right design and a grip on aerodynamics. Thus Leonardo created a hang
glider of sorts that hundreds of years later was built and flown. He
called it an uccello—a great bird.

He also had a grasp of engineering and the value of a good pulley
system. They would’ve loved him at Home Depot. Like his Discworld
namesake, Leonardo had a few weapons and other war toys in his creative
arsenal, namely the tank, a giant crossbow, and the steampowered cannon,
as well as an apparatus for breathing underwater. Many of these were
created under the patronage of the Duke of Urbino. Ironically, Leonardo
was against war.

Yet others are also credited in the history of the cannon and the
creation of gunpowder before the tenth century. Some form of gunpowder,
or at least saltpeter, was in use in China, along with the
precursor to the cannon. Exactly who came up with the ultimate formula
for gunpowder is debatable. Thirteenth-century Franciscan friar and
philosopher Roger Bacon, whose genius Leonardo admired, had a recipe.
And a German monk named Berthold Schwarz may also have invented a type
of cannon. Still, you have to give props to the maestro of the
Renaissance—Leonardo da Vinci.

In the Real World

Maybe by now you’re wondering just as we are what would happen if the
Discworld characters were suddenly sucked into the vortex of
reality/game show TV in our world (with Terry Pratchett’s approval, of
course)? Which characters would last on Survivor or Survivorman? Amazing
Race? American Idol? Project Runway ? The Bachelor? The Apprentice? Are
You Smarter than a Fifth Grader? DIY shows like the ones you see on HGTV
or TLC? Based on the books of the Discworld series, we can only guess.

First, the contestants …

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

You already know about Survivor—the CBS show that drops ordinary people
like us on remote locations and leaves them to … survive. And you
probably watch Survivorman—the Science Channel’s ultimate Robinson
Crusoe experience with its one-guy-no-cameracrew approach—too.

Due to their against-all-odds survival on Fourecks (or XXXX if you
prefer) in The Last Continent, Mustrum Ridcully, the profs of Unseen
University (the Dean, the Senior Wrangler, the Lecturer in Recent Runes,
etc.) and their refined housekeeper, Mrs. Whitlow, would make a
formidable team on Survivor. We’ll call them Team UU, since we don’t
know the Survivor site (we don’t make those up) and can’t think of a
clever tribal name to go with an island location we don’t know. The
wizards have the benefit of magic. Mrs. Whitlow … has the benefit of
being Mrs. Whitlow. Unfortunately, the wizards tend to argue, so we
would expect any alliances to end by the second week. As the weeks
progress, we expect Team UU to whittle down to Ridcully and Mrs. Whitlow
for sure, due to Ridcully’s tenacious grasp on life. And since Ridcully
is a gentleman and a little afraid of Mrs. Whitlow, we expect Mrs.
Whitlow to be the lone survivor of that team.

Meanwhile, Rincewind and the Luggage (Team Coward) would make powerful
allies. And since the Luggage, that sapient pearwood box of menace,
could swallow the other contestants one by one, they would be
unstoppable! Yeah! But Rincewind has a tendency to leave the Luggage
behind. So, there goes that alliance before it even gets off the ground.

Vimes and Colon (Blue Team) would make an excellent team due to their
ability to survive murderous werewolves and golems in The Fifth Elephant
and Feet of Clay, respectively. But since both are family men, expect
neither to show up at the Survivor drop site—not if Sybil Vimes and
Colon’s wife have anything to say on the subject.

The team to beat is Rincewind, Conina, and Nijel (Team Wunderkind),
based on their team-up in Sourcery, in which they survive the mage war.
With a deadly weapon like Conina, the daughter of Cohen the Barbarian,
there’s no way they could lose, unless the Luggage is involved and it’s
ticked off by someone. But since Conina and Nijel don’t enter the
Dungeon Dimension and
Rincewind does, we wouldn’t expect them to out-survive Rincewind.

Of course, the nature of a TV show like Survivor means that only one
person can survive. That means we’re down to Mrs. Whitlow and Rincewind
for the final match. Since Rincewind has survived everything that
Pratchett has thrown at him, well, he’s the evident favorite, one who
would out-survive even Mrs. Whitlow.

Because of his involuntary survival skills, we could see Rincewind acing
Survivorman as well. Again, we’re not drunk. Rincewind could give Les
Stroud a run for his money. Because he makes the trip to Fourecks as
well as survive in the Dungeon Dimension and other extremely hostile
environments, we would back Rincewind to win, hands down. Of course, in
a hand-to-hand combat, Les Stroud could beat Rincewind easily. So could
Greebo, Nanny Ogg’s villainous cat. But Rincewind is the original
Survivorman.

A Race Against Time

The Amazing Race pits team after team on a race across designated
locations around the world, with embarrassing side games thrown in
involving plowing, pulling, or carrying large or slippery objects for
our viewing pleasure. We don’t have to tell you who would be an
incredible match-up for that show. Okay, you convinced us. We’ll tell.
Our dream teams: Rincewind, Two-flower, and the Luggage (team 1);
Granny, Nanny, and Magrat (team 2); and Nobby Nobbs, Sergeant Colon,
Lord Vetinari, and Leonard of Quirm (team 3).

Since Twoflower has an amazing ability to find danger everywhere as we
learn in The Color of Magic, The Light Fantastic, and Interesting Times,
this would be a race not only against time but for survival as well. But
we can almost predict that his team would be locked in a Turkish prison
somewhere and would be eliminated within the first twenty-four hours.

Leonard of Quirm, Nobby, Colon, and Lord Vetinari travel to Al Khali, a
city in Klatch, in Leonard’s Going-Under-the-Water-Safely Device,
otherwise known as a submarine (Jingo). Because they play nicely
together in that city, they would make a great team. But since Nobby and
Colon usually try to avoid dangerous travel, we would expect their team
to be eliminated early on, especially since Vetinari is too busy running
Ankh-Morpork and Leonard is virtually a prisoner.

Because Granny, Nanny, and Magrat are able to successfully turn back
time in Wyrd Sisters, we would expect them to win this game easily.
Plus, they’ve got those handy broomsticks to travel on.

Fit for Fashion?

Bravo’s Project Runway provides a would-be fashion designer a chance to
hit the big time. Although we’re not 100 percent positive, we wonder if
someone like Magrat Garlick, who is known for her interesting fashion
sense, would be a good contestant. Although Granny Weatherwax and Nanny
Ogg routinely mock her outfits, Magrat still soldiers on.

For their work in dressing Magrat in Witches Abroad, we also would
nominate Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax as contestants. After all, they
have magic at their disposal, although Granny probably wouldn’t use it.
And Granny’s got that withering stare that’s just perfect for sessions
with haughty judges. But since neither really cares deeply about
fashion, well, we would expect a few stern lectures from the industry
judges on fashion à la that of Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) to Andy
Sachs (Anne Hathaway) in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada.

We’d also nominate the fifth-level wizard Spelter in Sourcery, who rigs
up a fake archchancellor hat with lace and Ankhstones for Coin. Quite
fetching.

A Star Is Born

We would kill to see someone like Agnes Nitt, Nanny Ogg, Sybil Vimes, or
any of the Nac Mac Feegles on American Idol. Agnes sings arias in
Maskerade and has an amazing voice. But is she the pop star that
everyone is looking for? Probably not, as Maskerade proves when
Christine is chosen for the “visible” lead in the operas, instead of
Agnes. Well, Agnes could still sing the songs while the other
contestants lip-synched.

Nanny Ogg, who is fond of songs like “The Hedgehog Song,” would be a
favorite because of her cheerful personality. But she’d get voted off
within minutes by Simon, Randy, and Paula. Ditto Sybil. She can sing
“The Ransom Song” from the opera Bloodaxe and Ironhammer (The Fifth
Elephant). But does that have a beat America wants to dance to? More
than likely, no.

The Feegles would provide many moments of entertainment early on, being
fond of singing while inebriated. But we’re fairly certain that, at the
last moment, Christine would make an appearance and place far higher
than anyone else in Discworld, even if she’s not listed as a contestant.

An Apt Apprentice

Since the witches of Discworld have the apprentice thing down pat,
getting on a show like The Apprentice is a natural segue. And since most
of the witches are industrious, they might stick around for a while.
However, in the category of “plays nicely with others” (okay, there is
no category on the show like that; we would call this “being a team
player”), many of the witches would not pass muster since they barely
tolerate each other. Still, with magic at their disposal (if magic
traveled through the vortex as well), no one would dare tell any of
them, “You’re fired!”

Instead of Donald Trump, Martha Stewart, or any other celebrity boss,
who is better than Granny Weatherwax to take over the reins? In
Wintersmith, Granny Weatherwax is the one consulted when the question of
who will get Miss Treason’s cottage arises. And since Granny Weatherwax
is the unofficial witch in charge, if she were a contestant on The
Apprentice, she would run the show in no time flat, anyway.

Equally Eligible

Who but Carrot Ironfoundersson would interest an audience (well, a
female audience) on a show like The Bachelor? Some of the female
officers of the Watch (Angua and Sally) would agree. And maybe William
de Worde or Moist von Lipwig (Going Postal) could generate some
interest. But perhaps Sacharissa Cripslock and Adora Belle Dearheart
would object. (Carrot would probably object to being on such a show as
well.)

We’re pretty sure who wouldn’t make the contestant cut. None of the
wizards of Unseen University have the interest to be on this type of
show, unless it was The Bachelorette and Mrs. Whitlow was the star. And
as far as the other watchmen are concerned (Nobby, Detritus, etc.),
well, there’s always next year … .

As for bachelorette shows like The Bachelorette or I Love New York
(insert your own nickname equivalent for the Ankh-Morpork bachelorette
of your choice), we suspect guys would choose such characters as Sally,
Angua, Conina, Adora Belle, Sacharissa, Sally, Tawneee (Nobby’s
girlfriend in Thud!), and others for reasons known only to them.

Smarter than the Average Kid?

The Jeff Foxworthy-hosted Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader? boasts
questions taken from first to fifth grade textbooks and makes
fools out of adults. Seeing as how the average fifth grader has to have
a breadth of knowledge that many Ph.D. candidates might have had a
hundred years ago, we can only suspect that a Renaissance man like
Leonard of Quirm or Ponder Stibbons, the smartest of the Unseen
University profs, would survive only a few questions before being
embarrassed by the average kid.

A friend of ours who recently received a doctorate claimed that she
didn’t know some of the answers to the questions asked on one show. See
what we mean?

Denizens of DIY

If you have a hankering for Home Depot, you probably are a DIYer and hit
HGTV or TLC pretty heavily. These channels are rife with DIY shows where
homeowners watch in horror or stupefied resignation as designers
“improve” their homes. (Okay, not all DIY shows are like this.) See,
these shows are perfect for Leonard of Quirm, Bloody Stupid Johnson, or
Coin, the young sourcerer of Sourcery. Coin’s ability to create things
is unparalleled. Remember how he shows the other wizards the Garden of
Maligree, the last sourcerer? And remember his redecorating scheme for
Unseen University? (Knock down walls. Change the ceilings and flooring.
Give the building a new glass and marble look. Get rid of the library.)
A decorating scheme that bold and controversial is “good TV,” especially
if you are a fan of certain designers on Trading Spaces.

That’s why Bloody Stupid Johnson, with his amazing flair for getting
things wrong, would be the DIY king of any network, if he were actually
“alive” in Discworld and not just a series of posthumous anecdotes.

As for Leonard, well, no door would be closed to a man of his talents.
Not only could he redecorate, he could provide his own artwork as well.

 

 

THE END?

Unlike this book, the Discworld series shows no sign of ending. After
writing this book, we bought the second book involving Moist von Lipwig,
Making Money, and are reading it, hence the lack of information about it
in this book. There is a rumor of another Tiffany Aching book (not sure
when that will be released). How many more Discworld books will the
prolific Mr. Pratchett write? Will there be another Rincewind, City
Watch, or Lancre witch book? We hope so! When you’ve got a jones for
Discworld, there’s no such thing as too many books.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS

 

 

Carrie Pyykkonen is anxiously waiting for a lifetimer that grants extra
time while living in Wheaton, Illinois, with her husband, two children,
four cats (two are visitors), and a dog named Wilfred. She has dabbled
in writing due to Linda’s nagging, volunteers by wearing a long garment
called an alb, and spends a lot of money on animal food. (Please buy
more books so sweet little Samantha can eat.) This is her second book
project that involves talking animals and fantastical creatures for
which she still has no use. She plans on spending more time
photographing her animals in pink dresses and parasols.

 

Linda Washington is a freelance writer living in Carol Stream, Illinois,
who has authored or coauthored thirty-eight books. She still mooches
food from the Pyykkonens on Sundays and keeps adding to her increasingly
large library of nonsense books, DVDs, and music. She became a huge fan
of Terry Pratchett, thanks to (see dedication). She aspires to find the
perfect cookie, own her own flying machine, and flee the newest trend of
her friends, which is to acquire odd pets.

Glares during Pratchett reading are inevitable if they are by a

The legal mystery is another subgenre. But since none of Pratchett’s
City Watch stories take place in a courtroom setting, we left that
subgenre off the list. However, we’re sure Pratchett would put his own
spin on that one as well.
