Hail and Farewell
1953
But of course he was going away, there was nothing else to do, the time
was up, the clock had run out, and he was going very far away indeed.
His suitcase was packed, his shoes were shined, his hair was brushed, he
had expressly washed behind his ears, and it remained only for him to go
down the stairs, out the front door, and up the street to the small-town
station where the train would make a stop for him alone. Then Fox Hill,
Illinois, would be left far off in his past. And he would go on, perhaps
to Iowa, perhaps to Kansas, perhaps even to California; a small boy
twelve years old with a birth certificate in his valise to show he had
been born forty-three years ago.
‘Willie!’ called a voice downstairs.
‘Yes!’ He hoisted his suitcase. In his bureau mirror he saw a face made
of June dandelions and July apples and warm summer-morning milk. There,
as always, was his look of the angel and the innocent, which might
never, in the years of his life, change.
‘Almost time,’ called the woman’s voice.
‘All right!’ And he went down the stairs, grunting and smiling. In the
living-room sat Anna and Steve, their clothes painfully neat.
‘Here I am!’ cried Willie in the parlor door.
Anna looked like she was going to cry. ‘Oh, good Lord, you can’t really
be leaving us, can you, Willie?’
‘People are beginning to talk,’ said Willie quietly. I’ve been here
three years now. But when people begin to talk, I know it’s time to put
on my shoes and buy a railway ticket.’
‘It’s all so strange. I don’t understand. It’s so sudden,’ Anna said.
‘Willie, we’ll miss you.
‘I’ll write you every Christmas, so help me. Don’t you write me.’
Its been a great pleasure and satisfaction, said Steve, sitting
there, his words the wrong size in his mouth. Its a shame it had to
stop. Its a shame you had to tell us about yourself. Its an awful
shame you cant stay on.
Youre the nicest folks I ever had, said Willie, four feet high, in no
need of a shave, the sunlight on his face.
And then Anna did cry. Willie, Willie. And she sat down and looked as
if she wanted to hold him but was afraid to hold him now; she looked at
him with shock and amazement and her hands empty, not knowing what to do
with him now.
Its not easy to go, said Willie. You get used to things. You want to
stay. But it doesnt work. I tried to stay on once after people began to
suspect. “Flow horrible! people said. “All these years, playing with
our innocent children, they said, “and us not guessing! Awful! they
said. And finally I had to just leave town one night. Its not easy. You
know darned well how much I love both of you. Thanks for three swell
years.
They all went to the front door. Willie, wherere you going?
I dont know. I just start traveling. When I see a town that looks
green and nice, I settle in.
Will you ever come back?
Yes, he said earnestly with his high voice. In about twenty years it
should begin to show in my face. When it does, Im going to make a grand
tour of all the mothers and fathers Ive ever had.
They stood on the cool summer porch, reluctant to say the last words.
Steve was looking steadily at an elm tree. How many other folksve you
stayed with, Willie? How many adoptions?
Willie figured it, pleasantly enough. I guess its about five towns and
five couples and over twenty years gone by since I started my tour.
Well, we cant holler, said Steve. Better tove had a son thirty-six
months than none whatever.
Well, said Willie, and kissed Anna quickly, seized at his luggage, and
was gone up the street in the green noon light, under the trees, a very
young boy indeed, not looking back, running steadily.
he The boys were playing on the green park diamond when came by. He
stood a little while among the oak-tree shadows, watching them hurl the
white, snowy baseball into the warm summer air, saw the baseball shadow
fly like a dark bird over the grass, saw their hands open in mouths to
catch this swift piece of summer that now seemed most especially
important to hold on to. The boys voices yelled. The ball lit on the
grass near Willie.
Carrying the ball toward from under the shade trees, he thought of the
last three years now spent to the penny, and the five years before that,
and so on down the line to the year when he was really eleven and twelve
and fourteen and the voices saying: Whats wrong with Willie, missus?
Mrs. B., is Willie late a-growing? Willie, you smokin cigars
lately? The echoes died in summer light and color. His mothers voice:
~Willies twenty-one today! And a thousand voices saying: Come back,
son, when youre fifteen; then maybe well give you a job.
l-le stared at the baseball in his trembling hand, as if it were his
life, an interminable ball of years strung around and around and around,
but always leading back to his twelfth birthday. He heard the kids
walking toward him; he felt them blot out the sun, and they were older,
standing around him.
Willie! Where you goin? They kicked his suitcase.
How tall they stood in the sun. In the last few months it seemed the sun
had passed a hand above their heads, and they were golden toffee pulled
by an immense gravity to the sky, thirteen, fourteen years old, looking
down upon Willie, smiling, but already beginning to neglect him. It had
started four months ago:
~Choose up sides! Who wants Willie?
Aw, Willies too little; we dont play with “kids.
And they raced ahead of him, drawn by the moon and the sun and the
turning seasons of leaf and wind, and lie was twelve years old and not
of them any more. And the other voices beginning again on the old, the
dreadfully familiar, the cool refrain: Better feed that boy vitamins,
Steve. Anna, does shortness run in your family? And the cold fist
knocking at your heart again and knowing that the roots would have to be
pulled up again after so many good years with the “folks.
Willie, where you goin?
He jerked his head. He was back among the towering, shadowing boys who
milled around him like giants at a drinking fountain bending down.
Goin a few days visitin a cousin of mine.
Oh. There was a day, a year ago, when they would have cared very much
indeed. But now there was only curiosity for his luggage, their
enchantment with trains and trips and far places.
How about a game? said Willie.
They looked doubtful, but, considering the circumstances, nodded. lie
dropped his bag and ran out; the white baseball was up in the sun, away
to their burning white figures in the far meadow, up in the sun again,
rushing, life coming and going in a pattern. Here, there! Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Hanlon, Creek Bend, Wisconsin, 1932, the first couple, the first
year! Here, there! Henry and Alice Boltz, Limeville, Iowa, 1935! The
baseball flying. The Smiths, the Eatons, the Robinsons! 1939! 1945!
Husband and wife, husband and wife, husband and wife, no children, no
children! A knock on this door, a knock on that.
Pardon me. My name is William. I wonder if A sandwich? Come in, sit
down. Where you from, son?
The sandwich, a tall glass of cold milk, the smiling, the nodding, the
comfort able, leisurely talking.
Son, you look like you been traveling. You run off from somewhere?
No.
Boy, are you an orphan?
Another glass of milk.
We always wanted kids. It never worked out. Never knew why. One of
those things. Well, well. fts getting late, son. Dont you think you
better hit for home?
Got no home.
A boy like you? Not dry behind the ears? Your motherll be worried.
Got no borne and no folks anywhere in the world. I wonder if  I wonder
 could I sleep here tonight?
Well, now, son, I dont just know. We never considered taking in  
said the husband.
We got chicken for supper tonight, said the wife, enough for extras,
enough for company…
And the years turning and flying away, the voices, and the faces, and
the people, and always the same first conversations. The voice of Emily
Robinson, in her rocking chair, in summernight darkness, the last night
he stayed with her, the night she discovered his secret, her voice
saying:
I look at all the little childrens faces going by. And I sometimes
think. What a shame, what a shame, that all these flowers have to be
cut, all these bright fires have to be put out. What a shame these, all
of these you see in schools or running by, have to get tall and
unsightly and wrinkle and turn gray or get bald, and finally, all bone
and wheeze, be dead and buried off away. When I hear them laugh I cant
believe theyll ever go the road Im going. Yet here they come! I still
remember Wordsworths poem:
When all at once I saw a crowd, A host of golden daffodils; Beside the
lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. Thats
how I think of children, cruel as they sometimes are, mean as I know
they can be, but not yet showing the meanness around their eyes or in
their eyes, not yet full of tiredness. Theyre so eager for everything!
I guess thats what I miss most in older folks, the eagerness gone nine
times out of ten, the freshness gone, so much of the drive and life down
the drain. I like to watch school let out each day. Its like someone
threw a bunch of flowers out of the school front doors. How does it
feel, Willie? How does it feel to be young forever? To look like a
silver dime new from the mint? Are you happy? Are you as fine as you
seem?
The baseball whizzed from the blue sky, stung his hand like a great pale
insect. Nursing it, he hears his memory say:
1 worked with what I had. After my folks died, after I found I couldnt
get mans work anywhere, I tried carnivals, but they only laughed.
“Son, they said, “youre not a midget, and even if you are, you look
like a boy! We want midgets with midgets laces! Sorry, son, sorry. So I
left home, started out, thinking: What was I? A boy. I looked like a
boy, sounded like a boy, so I might as well goon being a boy. No use
lighting it. No use screaming. So what could I do? What job was handy?
And then one day I saw this man in a restaurant looking at another mans
pictures of his children. “Sure wish I had kids, he said. “Sure wish I
had kids. He kept shaking his head. And me sitting a few seats away
from him, a hamburger in my hands. I sat there, _frozen; _At that very
instant I knew what my job would be for all the rest of my life. There
was work for me, after all. Making lonely people happy. Keeping myself
busy. Playing forever. I knew I had to play forever. Deliver a few
papers, run a few errands, mow a few lawns, maybe. But hard work? No.
All I had to do was be a mothers son and a fathers pride. I turned to
the man down the counter from me. “I beg your pardon, I said. I smiled
at him . .
But, Willie, said Mrs Emily long ago, didnt you ever get lonely?
Didnt you ever want  things  that grown-ups wanted?
I fought that out alone, said Willie. Im a boy, I told myself, Ill
have to live in a boys world, read boys books, play boys games, cut
myself off from everything else. I cant be both. I got to be only one
thing  young. And so I played that way. Oh, it wasnt easy. There were
times He lapsed into silence.
And the family you lived with, they never knew?
No. Telling them would have spoiled everything. I told them I was a
runaway; I let them cheek through official channels, police. Then, when
there was no record, let them put in to adopt me. That was best of all;
as long as they never guessed. But then, after three years, or five
years, they guessed, or a traveling man came through, or a carnival man
saw me, and it was over. It always had to end.
And youre very happy and its nice being a child for over forty
years?
Its a living, as they say; and when you make other people happy, then
youre almost happy too. I got my job to do and I do it.
He threw the baseball one last time and broke the reverie. Then he was
running to seize his luggage. Tom, Bill, Jamie, Bob, Sam  their names
moved on his lips. They were embarrassed at his shaking hands.
After all, Willie, it aint as if youre going to China or Timbuktu. ~
Thats right, isnt it? Willie did not move.
So long, Willie. See you next week!
So long, so long!
And he was walking off with his suitcase again, looking at the trees,
going away from the boys and the street where he had lived, and as he
turned the corner a train whistle screamed, and he began to run.
In the early morning, with the smell of the mist and the cold metal,
with the iron smell of the train around him and a ill night of traveling
shaking his bones and his body, and a smell of the sun beyond the
horizon, he awoke and looked out upon a small town just arising from
sleep. Lights were coming on, soft voices muttered, a red signal bobbed
back and forth, back and forth in the cold air. A porter moved by,
shadow in shadows.
Sir, said Willie.
The porter stopped.
What towns this? whispered the boy in the dark.
Valleyville.
How many people?
Ten thousand. Why? This your stop?
It looks green. Willie gazed out at the cold morning town for a long
time. It looks nice and quiet, said Willie.
Son, said the porter, you know where you going?
Here, said Willie, and got up quietly in the still, cool,
iron-smelling morning, in the train dark, with a rustling arid stir.
I hope you know what youre doing, boy, said the porter.
Yes, sir, said Willie. I know what Im doing. And he was down the
dark aisle, luggage lifted after him by the porter, and out in the
smoking, steaming-cold, beginning-to-lighten morning. He stood looking
tip at the porter arid the black metal train against the few remaining
stars. The train gave a great wailing blast of whistle, the porters
cried out all along the line, the cars jolted, and his special porter
waved and smiled down at the boy there, the small boy there with the big
luggage who shouted up to him, even as the whistle screamed again.
What? shouted the porter, hand cupped to ear.
Wish me luck! cried Millie.
Best of luck, son, called the porter, waving, smiling. Best of luck,
boy!
Thanks, said Willie, in the great sound of the train, in the steam and
roar.
He watched the black train until it was completely gone away and out of
sight. He did not move all the time it was going. He stood quietly, a
small boy twelve years old, on the worn wooden platform, and only after
three entire minutes did he turn at last to face the empty streets
below.
Then, as the sun was rising, he began to walk very fast, so as to keep
warm, down into the new town.
