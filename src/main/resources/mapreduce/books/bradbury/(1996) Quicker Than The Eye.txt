To Donn Albright,
my Golden Retriever,
with love
UNTERDERSEABOAT DOKTOR
The incredible event occurred during my third visit to Gustav Von
Seyfertitz, my foreign psychoanalyst.
I should have guessed at the strange explosion before it came.
After all, my alienist, truly alien, had the coincidental name, Von
Seyfertitz, of the tall, lean, aquiline, menacing, and therefore
beautiful actor who played the high priest in the 1935 film She.
In She, the wondrous villain waved his skeleton fingers, hurled insults,
summoned sulfured flames, destroyed slaves, and knocked the world into
earthquakes.
After that, "At Liberty," he could be seen riding the Hollywood
Boulevard trolley cars as calm as a mummy, as quiet as an unwired
telephone pole.
Where was I? Ah, yes!
It was my third visit to my psychiatrist. He had called that day and
cried, "Douglas, you stupid goddamn son of a bitch, it's time for
beddy-bye!
Beddy-bye was, of course, his couch of pain and humiliation where I lay
writhing in agonies of assumed Jewish guilt and Northern Baptist stress
as he from time to time muttered, "A fruitcake remark!" or "Dumb!" or
"If you ever do that again, I'll kill you!"
As you can see, Gustav Von Seyfertitz was a most
unusual mine specialist. Mine? Yes. Our problems are land mines in our
heads. Step on them! Shock-troop therapy, he once called it, searching
for words. "Blitzkrieg?" I offered.
"Ja!" He grinned his shark grin. "That's it!"
Again, this was my third visit to his strange, metallic-looking room
with a most odd series of locks on a roundish door. Suddenly, as I was
maundering and treading dark waters, I heard his spine stiffen behind
me. He gasped a great death rattle, sucked air, and blew it out in a
yell that curled and bleached my hair:
"Dive! Dive!"
I dove.
Thinking that the room might be struck by a titanic iceberg, I fell, to
scuttle beneath the lion-claw-footed couch.
"Dive!" cried the old man.
"Dive?" I whispered, and looked up.
To see a submarine periscope, all polished brass, slide up to vanish in
the ceiling.
Gustav Von Seyfertitz stood pretending not to notice me, the sweat-oiled
leather couch, or the vanished brass machine. Very calmly, in the
fashion of Conrad Veidt in Casablanca, or Erich Von
like Jack Nicklaus hits a ball? Bamm. A hand grenade!
That was the sound my Germanic friend's boots
made as he knocked them together in a salute Crrrack!
"Gustav Mannerheim Auschlitz Von Seyfertitz Baron Woldstein, at your
service!" He lowered his voice. "Unterderseaboat-"
I thought he might say "Doktor." But:
"Unterderseaboat Captain!"
I scrambled off the floor.
Another crrrack and-The periscope slid calmly down out of the
ceiling, the most beautiful Freudian cigar I had ever seen.
"No!" I gasped.
"Have I ever lied to you?" "Many times!"
"But' '-he shrugged-' 'little white ones.” He stepped to the periscope,
slapped two
handles in place, slammed one eye shut, and crammed the other angrily
against the view piece, turning the periscope in a slow roundabout of
the room, the couch, and me.
"Fire one," he ordered.
I almost heard the torpedo leave its tube. "Fire two!" he said.
And a second soundless and invisible bomb
motored on its way to infinity. Struck midships, I sank to the couch.
"You, you!" I said mindlessly. "It!" I pointed
at the brass machine. "This!" I touched couch. "Why?"
"Sit down," said Von Seyfertitz.
"I am." "Lie down."
"I'd rather not," I said uneasily.
Von Seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye, raked at an
angle, glared at me. It had an uncanny resemblance, in its glassy
coldness, his own fierce hawk's gaze.
His voice, from behind the periscope, echoed. "So you want to know, eh,
how Gustav  Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, suffered to leave the cold
ocean depths, depart his dear North Sea ship, flee his destroyed and
beaten fatherland, to become the Unterderseaboat Doktor-"
"Now that you mention-"
"I never mention! I declare. And my declarations are sea-battle
commands."
"So I noticed . .
"Shut up. Sit back-"
"Not just now . . ." I said uneasily.
His heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket
and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me: a bright, thin
monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg. I
winced. For now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with
cold fire.
"Why the monocle?" I said.
"Idiot! It is to cover my good eye so that neither there eye can see and
my intuition is free to work!”
"Oh," I said.
And he began his monologue. And as he talked I realized his need had
been pent up, capped, years, so he talked on and on, forgetting me.
And it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred. I rose
slowly to my feet as Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz circled, his long, slim
cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air, which read like white Rorschach
blots.
With each implantation of his foot, a word ca out, and then another, in
a sort of plodding grammar. Sometimes he stopped and stood poised with
one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his
tongue and examined. Then the shoe went down, the noun slid forth and
the verb and object in good time.
Until at last, circling, I found myself in a chair stunned, for I saw:
Herr Doktor Von Seyfertitz stretched on his couch, his long spider
fingers laced on his chest.
"It has been no easy thing to come forth on land," he sibilated. "Some
days I was the jellyfish, frozen. Others, the shore-strewn octopi,
at least with tentacles, or the crayfish sucked back into my skull. But
I have built my spine, year on year, and now I walk among the land men
and survive."
He paused to take a trembling breath, then continued:
"I moved in stages from the depths to a houseboat, to a wharf bungalow,
to a shore-tent and then
back to a canal in a city and at last to New York
an island surrounded by water, eh? But where,
where, in all this, I wondered, would a submarine commander find his
place, his work, his mad love and activity?
"It was one afternoon in a building with the world's longest elevator
that it struck me like a hand grenade in the ganglion. Going down, down,
down, other people crushed around me, and the numbers descending and the
floors whizzing by the glass windows, rushing by flicker-flash,
flicker-flash, conscious, subconscious, id, ego-id, life, death, lust,
kill, lust, dark, light, plummeting, falling, ninety, eighty, fifty,
lower depths, high exhilaration, id, ego, id, until this shout blazed
from my raw throat in a great all-accepting, panic-manic shriek:
"'Dive! Dive!'
"I remember," I said.
'Dive!' I screamed so loudly that my fellow passengers, in shock, peed
merrily. Among stunned faces, I stepped out of the lift to find
one-sixteenth of an inch of pee on the floor. 'Have a nice day!' I said,
jubilant with self-discovery, then ran to self-employment, to hang a
shingle and next my periscope, carried from the mutilated, divested,
castrated unterderseaboat all these years. Too stupid to see in it my
psychological future and my final downfall, my beautiful artifact, the
brass genitalia of psychotic research, the Von Seyfertitz Mark Nine
Periscope!"
"That's quite a story," I said.
"Damn right," snorted the alienist, eyes shut.
"And more than half of it true. Did you listen? What have you learned?"
"That more submarine captains should become psychiatrists."
"So? I have often wondered: did Nemo really die when his submarine was
destroyed? Or did he run off to become my great-grandfather and were his
psychological bacteria passed along until I came into the world,
thinking to command the ghostlike mechanisms that haunt the under tides,
to wind up with the fifty-minute vaudeville routine in this sad,
psychotic city?"
I got up and touched the fabulous brass symbol that hung like a
scientific stalactite in mid-ceiling.
"May I look?"
"I wouldn't if I were you." He only half heard me, lying in the midst of
his depression as in a dark cloud.
"It's only a periscope-"
"But a good cigar is a smoke."
I remembered Sigmund Freud's quote about cigars, laughed, and touched
the periscope again.
"Don't!" he said.
"Well, you don't actually use this for anything, do you? It's just a
remembrance of your past, from your last sub, yes?"
"You think that?" He sighed. "Look!"
I hesitated, then pasted one eye to the viewer, shut the other, and
cried:
"Oh, Jesus!"
"I warned you!" said Von Seyfertitz.
For they were there.
Enough nightmares to paper a thousand cinema screens. Enough phantoms to
haunt ten thousand castle walls. Enough panics to shake forty cities
into ruin.
My God, I thought, he could sell the film rights to this worldwide!
The first psychological kaleidoscope in history.
And in the instant another thought came: how much of that stuff in there
is me? Or Von Seyfertitz? Or both? Are these strange shapes my
maundering daymares, sneezed out in the past weeks? When I talked, eyes
shut, did my mouth spray invisible founts of small beasts which, caught
in the periscope chambers, grew outsize? Like the microscopic photos of
those germs that hide in eyebrows and pores, magnified a million times
to become elephants on Scientific American covers? Are these images from
other lost souls trapped on that couch and caught in the submarine
device, or leftovers from my eyelashes and psyche?
"It's worth millions!" I cried. "Do you know what this is!?"
"Collected spiders, Gila monsters, trips to the Moon without gossamer
wings, iguanas, toads out of bad sisters' mouths, diamonds out of good
fairies ears, crippled shadow dancers from Bali, cut-string puppets from
Geppetto's attic, little-boy statues that pee white wine, sexual trapeze
performers' alley-oop, obscene finger-pantomimes, evil clown faces,
gargoyles that talk when it rains and whisper when the wind rises,
basement bins
full of poisoned honey, dragonflies that sew every fourteen-year-old's
orifices to keep them neat until they rip the sutures, aged eighteen.
Towers with mad witches, garrets with mummies for lumber-"
He ran out of steam.
"You get the general drift."
"Nuts," I said. "You're bored. I could get you a five-million-dollar
deal with Amalgamated Fruit-cakes Inc. And the Sigmund F. Dreamboats,
split three ways!"
"You don't understand," said Von Seyfertitz. "I am keeping myself busy,
busy, so I won't remember all the people I torpedoed, sank, drowned
mid-Atlantic in 1944. I am not in the Amalgamated Fruitcake Cinema
business. I only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails,
cleaning earwax, and erasing inkblots from odd bean-bags like you. If I
stop, I will fly apart. That periscope contains all and everything I
have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans,
cashews, and almonds. By staring at them I lose my own terrible life
lost in the tides. If you won my periscope in some shoddy fly-by-night
Hollywood strip poker, I would sink three times in my waterbed, never to
be seen again. Have I shown you my waterbed? Three times as large as any
pool. I do eighty laps asleep each night. Some-times forty when I catnap
noons. To answer your million fold offer, no."
And suddenly he shivered all over. His hands clutched at his heart.
"My God!" he shouted.
Too late, he was realizing he had let me step into his mind and life.
Now he was on his feet between me and the periscope, staring at it and
me, as if we were both terrors.
"You saw nothing in that! Nothing at all!”
"I did!"
"You lie! How could you be such a liar? Do you know what would happen if
this got out, if you ran around making accusations-?
"My God," he raved on, "If the world knew, if someone said' '-His words
gummed shut in his mouth as if he were tasting the truth of what he
said, as if he saw me for the first time and I was a gun fired full in
his face. "I would be... laughed out of the city. Such a goddamn
ridiculous . . . hey, wait a minute. You!"
It was as if he had slipped a devil mask over his face. His eyes grew
wide. His mouth gaped.
I examined his face and saw murder. I sidled toward the door.
"You wouldn't say anything to anyone?” he said.
“No”
"How come you suddenly know everything about me?"
"You told me!"
"Yes," he admitted, dazed, looking around for a weapon. "Wait."
"if you don't mind," I said, "I'd rather not.” And I was out the door
and down the hall, my knees jumping to knock my jaw.
"Come back!" cried Von Seyfertitz, behind me. "I must kill you!"
"I was afraid of that!"
I reached the elevator first and by a miracle it flung wide its doors
when I banged the Down button. I jumped in.
"Say good-bye!" cried Von Seyfertitz, raising his fist as if it held a
bomb.
"Good-bye!" I said. The doors slammed.
I did not see Von Seyfertitz again for a year.
Meanwhile, I dined out often, not without guilt, telling friends, and
strangers on street corners, of my collision with a submarine commander
become phrenologist (he who feels your skull to count the beans).
So with my giving one shake of the ripe fruit tree, nuts fell. Overnight
they brimmed the Baron's lap to flood his bank account. His Grand Slam
will be recalled at century's end: appearances on Phil Donahue, Oprah
Winfrey, and Gerarldo in one single cyclonic afternoon, with
interchangeable hyperboles, positive-negative-positive every hour. There
were Von Seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine
periscope sold at the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. With the
super inducement of a half-million dollars, he force-fed and easily sold
a bad book. Duplicates of the animalcules, lurks, and curious critters
trapped in his brass viewer arose in pop-up coloring books, paste-on
tattoos, and inkpad rubberstamp nightmares at Beasts-R-Us.
I had hoped that all this would cause him to forgive and forget. No.
One noon a year and a month later, my doorbell rang and there stood
Gustav Von Seyfertitz, F Baron Woldstein, tears streaming down his
cheeks.
"How come I didn't kill you that day?” he mourned.
"You didn't catch me," I said.
"Oh, ja. That was it."
I looked into the old man's rain-washed, tear-ravened face and said,
"Who died?"
"Me. Or is it I? Ah, to hell with it: me. You see before you," he
grieved, "a creature who suffers from the Rumpelstiltskin Syndrome!"
"Rumpel-"
"-stiltskin! Two halves with a rip from chin to fly. Yank my forelock,
go ahead! Watch me fall apart at the seam. Like zipping a psychotic
zipper, I fall, two Herr Doktor Admirals for the sick price of one. And
which is the Doktor who heals and which the sellout best-seller Admiral?
It takes two mirrors to tell. Not to mention the smoke!"
He stopped and looked around, holding his head together with his hands.
"Can you see the crack? Am I splitting again to become this crazy sailor
who desires richness and fame, being sieved through the hands of crazed
ladies with ruptured libidos? Suffering fish, I call them! But take
their money, spit, spend! You should have such a year. Don’t laugh."
  “I’m not laughing."
"Then cheer up while I finish. Can I lie down? Is that a couch? Too
short. What do I do with my legs?"
"Sit sidesaddle."
Von Seyfertitz laid himself out with his legs draped over one side.
"Hey, not bad. Sit behind. Don't look over my shoulder. Avert your gaze.
Neither smirk nor pull long faces as I get out the crazy-glue and paste
Rumpel back with Stiltskin, the name of my next book, God help me. Damn
you to hell, you and your damned periscope!”
"Not mine. Yours. You wanted me to discover it that day. I suppose you
had been whispering Dive, Dive, for years to patients, half asleep. But
you couldn't resist the loudest scream ever: Dive! That was your captain
speaking, wanting fame and money enough to chock a horse show."
"God," murmured Von Seyfertitz, "How I hate it when you're honest.
Feeling better already. How much do I owe you?"
He arose.
"Now we go kill the monsters instead of you.”
"Monsters?"
"At my office. If we can get in past the lunatics."
"You have lunatics outside as well as in, now?”
"Have I ever lied to you?"
"Often. But," I added, "little white ones.”
"Come," he said.
We got out of the elevator to be confronted by a long line of
worshippers and supplicants. There
must have been seventy people strung out between the elevator and the
Baron's door, waiting with copies of books by Madame Blavatsky, Krishna
murti, and Shirley MacLaine under their arms. There was a roar like a
suddenly opened furnace door when they saw the Baron. We beat it on the
double and got inside his office before anyone could surge to follow.
"See what you have done to me!" Von Seyfertitz pointed.
The office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling. The desk was
from Napoleon's age an exquisite Empire piece worth at least fifty
thousand dollars. The couch was the best soft leather I had ever seen,
and the two pictures on the wall were originals-a Renoir and a Monet. My
God, millions! I thought.
"Okay," I said. "The beasts, you said. You'll kill them, not me?"
The old man wiped his eyes with the back of one hand, then made a fist.
"Yes!" he cried, stepping up to the fine periscope, which reflected his
face, madly distorted, in its elongated shape. "Like this. Thus and so!"
And before I could prevent, he gave the brass machine a terrific slap
with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another, with both
fists, cursing. Then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of
a spoiled child and throttled and shook it.
I cannot say what I heard in that instant. Perhaps real sounds, perhaps
imagined temblors, like a glacier
 cracking in the spring, or icicles in mid-night. Perhaps it was a sound
like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in
folds of tissue. Maybe I thought I heard a vast breath in sucked, a
cloud dissolving up inside itself. Or did I sense clock machineries spun
so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass
snowflakes?
I put my eye to the periscope.
I looked in upon-
Nothing.
It was just a brass tube with some crystal lenses and a view of an empty
couch.
No more.
I seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a
far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an
unimaginable horizon.
But the couch remained only a couch, and the wall beyond looked back at
me with its great blank face.
Von Seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to
fall on one rusted fist.
"Are they dead?" he whispered.
"Gone."
"Good, they deserved to die. Now I can return to some kind of normal,
sane world."
And with each word his voice fell deeper within his throat, his chest,
his soul, until it, like the vaporous haunts within the
peri-kaleidoscope, melted into silence.
He clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp
of prayer, like one who beseeches God to deliver him from plagues. And
whether he was once again praying for my death, eyes shut, or whether he
simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device, I could
not say.
I only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing. Me
and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this
incredible captain from beneath Nemo's tidal seas.
"Gone," murmured Gustav Von Seyfertitz, Baron Woldstein, whispered for
the last time. "Gone."
That was almost the end.
I went around a month later. The landlord reluctantly let me look over
the premises, mostly because I hinted that I might be renting.
We stood in the middle of the empty room where I could see the dent
marks where the couch had once stood.
I looked up at the ceiling. It was empty.
"What's wrong?" said the landlord. "Didn't they fix it so you can't see?
Damn fool Baron made a damn big hole up into the office above. Rented
that, too, but never used it for anything I knew of. There was just that
big damn hole he left when he went away."
I sighed with relief.
"Nothing left upstairs?"
"Nothing."
I looked up at the perfectly blank ceiling.
"Nice job of repair," I said.
"Thank God," said the landlord.
What, I often wonder, ever happened to Gustav Von Seyfertitz? Did he
move to Vienna, to take up residence, perhaps, in or near dear Sigmund’s
very own address? Does he live in Rio, aerating fellow Unterderseaboat
Captains who can't sleep for seasickness, roiling on their waterbeds
under the shadow of the Andes Cross? Or is he in South Pasadena, within
striking distance of the fruit larder nut farms disguised as film
studios?
I cannot guess.
All I know is that some nights in the year, oh, once or twice, in a deep
sleep I hear this terrible shout, his cry,
"Dive! Dive! Dive!"
And wake to find myself, sweating, far und my bed.
ZAHAROFF/RICHTCR MARK V
In the twilight just before sunrise, it was the most ordinary-looking
building he had seen since the chicken farm of his youth. It stood in
the middle of an empty field full of cricket weeds and cacti, mostly
dust and some neglected footpaths in the half darkness.
Charlie Crowe left the Rolls-Royce engine run-fling at the curb behind
him and babbled going along the shadowed path, leading the way for Rank
Gibson, who glanced back at the gently purring car.
"Shouldn't you-"
"No, no," Charlie Crowe cut in. "No one would steal a Rolls-Royce, now,
would they? How far would they get, to the next corner? Before someone
else stole it from them! Come along!"
"What's the hurry, we've got all morning!"
"That's what you think, chum. We've got-' Charlie Crowe eyed his watch.
"Twenty minutes, maybe fifteen for the fast tour, the coming disaster,
the revelations, the whole bit!"
"Don't talk so fast and slow down, you'll give me a heart attack."
"Save it for breakfast. Here. Put this in your pocket."
Hank Gibson looked at the coupon-green diploma.
"Insurance?"
"On your house, as of yesterday."
"But we don't need-"
"Yes, you do, but don't know it. Sign the duplicate. Here. Can you see?
Here's my flashlight and my pen. Thatsa boy. Give one to me. One for
you-"
"Christ-''
"No swearing. You're all protected now, no matter what. Jig time."
And before he knew it, Hank Gibson was elbow-fetched through a
paint-flaked door inside to yet another locked door, which opened when
Charlie Crowe pointed his electric laser at it. They stepped into-
"An elevator! What's an elevator doing in a shack in an empty lot at
five in the morning-"
"Hush."
The floor sank under them and they traveled what might have been seventy
or eighty feet straight down to where another door whispered aside and
they stepped out into a long hall of a dozen doors on each side with a
few dozen pleasantly glowing lights above. Before he could exclaim
again, Hank Gibson was hustled past these doors that bore the names of
cities and countries.
"Damn," cried Hank Gibson, "I hate being rushed through one god-awful
mystery after an-other. I'm working on a novel and a feature for my
newspaper. I've no time-"
"For the biggest story in the world? Bosh! You and I will write it,
share the profits! You can't resist. Calamities. Chaos. Holocausts !"
"You were always great for hyperbole-"
"Quiet. It's my turn to show and tell." Charlie Crowe displayed his
wristwatch. "We're wasting time. Where do we start?" He waved at the two
dozen shut doors surrounding them with labels marked CONSTANTINOPLE,
MEXICO CITY, LIMA, SAN FRANCISCO on one side.
Eighteen ninety-seven, 1914, 1938, 1963 on the other. Also, a special
door marked HAUSSMANN, 1870.
"Places and dates, dates and places. How in hell should I know why or
how to choose?"
"Don't these cities and dates ring any bells, stir any dust? Peek here.
Glance there. Go on."
Hank Gibson peeked.
To one side, through a glass window on the topmost part of a door marked
1789, he saw:
"Looks like Paris."
"Press the button there under the glass."
Hank Gibson pressed the button.
"Now look!"
Hank Gibson looked.
"My God, Paris. In flames. And there's the guillotine!"
"Correct. Now. Next door. Next window."
Hank Gibson moved and peeked.
"Paris again, by God. Do I press the button?"
"Why not?"
He pressed.
"Jesus, it's still burning. But this time it's 1870. The Commune?"
"Paris fighting Hessians outside the city, Parisians killing
Parisians inside the city. Nothing like the French, eh? Move!"
They reached a third window. Gibson peered.
"Paris. But not burning. There go the taxicabs. I know. Nineteen
sixteen. Paris saved by one thousand Paris taxis carrying troops to fend
off the Germans outside the city!"
"A-One! Next?"
At a fourth window.
"Paris intact. But over here. Dresden? Berlin? London? All destroyed."
"Right. How do you like the three-dimension virtual reality? Superb!
Enough of cities and war. Across the hall. Go down the line. All those
doors with different kinds of devastation."
"Mexico City? I was there once, in '46."
"Press."
Hank Gibson pressed the button.
The city fell, shook, fell.
"The earthquake of '84?"
"Eight-five, to be exact."
"Christ, those poor people. Bad enough they're poor. But thousands
killed, maimed, made poorer. And the government-"
"Not giving a damn. Move."
They stopped at a door marked ARMENIA 1988.
Gibson squinted in, pressed the button.
"Major country, Armenia. Major country-gone."
"Biggest quake in that territory in half a century."
They paused at two more windows: TOKYO, 1932, and SAN
FRANCISCO, 1905. Both whole, entire, intact at first glance. Touch the
button: all fall down!
Gibson turned away, shaken and pale.
"Well?" said his friend Charlie. "What's the sum?"
Gibson stared along the hall to left and right.
"War and Peace? Or Peace destroying itself without War?"
"Touche' !"
"Why are you showing me all this?"
"For your future and mine, untold riches, in-credible revelations,
amazing truths. Andale. Vamoose!"
Charlie Crowe flashed his laser pen at the largest door at the far end
of the hall. The double locks hissed; the door sank away to one side,
revealing a large boardroom with a huge table forty feet in length,
surrounded by twenty leather chairs on each side and something like a
throne, some-what elevated, at the far end.
"Go sit up at the end," said Charlie.
Hank Gibson moved slowly
"Oh, for Christ sake, shake a leg. We've only seven more minutes before
the end of the world."
      "End-?"
"Just joking. Ready?"
Hank Gibson sat. "Fire away."
The table, the chairs, and the room shook.
Gibson leaped up.
"What was that?"
"Nothing." Charlie Crowe checked his watch. "At least not yet. Sit back.
What have you seen?"
Gibson settled in his chair uneasily, grasping the arms. "Damned if I
know. History?"
"Yes, but what kind?"
"War and Peace. Peace and War. Bad Peace, of course. Earthquakes and
fire."
"Admirable. Now, who's responsible for all that destruction, two kinds?"
"What, war? Politicians, I guess. Ethnic mobs. Greed. Jealousy.
Munitions manufacturers. The Krupp works in Germany. Zaharoff, wasn't
that his name? The big munitions king, the grand mullah of all the
warmongers, films of him on the newsreels in cinemas when I was a kid.
Zaharoff?"
"Yes! What about the other side of the hall? The earthquakes."
"God did it."
"Only God? No helpers?"
"How can anyone help an earthquake?"
"Partially. Indirectly. Collaboratively."
"An earthquake is an earthquake. A city just happens to be in its way.
Underfoot."
"Wrong, Hank."
"Wrong!?"
"What if I told you that those cities were not accidentally built there?
What if I told you w had planned to build them there, on purpose, to be
destroyed?"
"Nuts!"
"No, Hank, creative annihilation. We were up to these tricks as far back
as the Tang dynasty earthquakewise on the one hand. Citywise? Paris
1789 warwise."
"We? We? Who's we?"
"Me, Hank, and my cohorts, not in crimson and gold, but good dark cloth
and decent ties and fine architectural school graduates. We did it, Hank
We built the cities so as to tear them down. To knock them apart with
earthquakes or kill their with bombs and war, war and bombs."
"We? We!?"
"In this room or rooms like it, all across the world, men sat in those
chairs on the left and right, with the grand mucky-muck of all
architects there where you sit-"
"Architects!"
"You don't think all of those earthquakes, all of those wars, happened
by mere accident, pure chance? We did it, Hank, the blueprint urban-plan
architects of the world. Not the munitions makers Or politicians, oh, we
used them as puppets, marionettes, useful idiots, but we, the superb
hired city architects, set out to build and then destroy our pets, our
buildings, our cities!"
"For God's sake, how insane! Why?"
"Why? So that every forty, fifty, sixty, ninety years we could start
over with fresh projects, new concepts, renewed jobs, cash on the line
for everyone - blueprinters, planners, craftsmen, builders, stonemasons,
diggers, carpenters, glaziers, gardeners. Knock it all down, start new!"
"You mean you-?"
"Studied where the earthquakes hid, where they might erupt, every seam,
crack, and fault in every territory, stage, land in the world! That's
where we built the cities! Or most of them."
"B.S.! You couldn't do that, you and your planners! People would find
out!"
"They never knew or found out. We met in secret, covered our tracks. A
small klan, a wee band of conspirators in every country in every age.
Like the Masons, eh? Or some Inquisitional Catholic sect? Or an
underground Muslim grot. It doesn't take many or much. And the average
politician, dumb or stupid, took our word for it. This is the site,
here's the very place, plant your capital here, your town there.
Perfectly safe. Until the next quake, eh, Hank?"
"Poppycock!"
"Watch your language!"
"I refuse to believe-"
The room shook. The chairs trembled. Half out of his chair, Hank Gibson
sank back. The color in his face sank, too.
"Two minutes to go," said Charlie Crowe. "Shall I talk fast? Well, you
don't think the destiny of the world would be left to your ordinary
farm-beast politico, do you? Have you ever sat at
a Rotary/Lions lunch with those sweet imbecile Chamber of Commerce
stallions? Sleep an dreams! Would you let the world jog along wit
Zaharoff and his gun-maker-powder experts? Hell no. They only know how
to fire steel and package nitro. So our people, the same people who
built the cities on the earthquake fault lines to ensure new work to
build more cities, we planned the wars, secretly.
"We provoked, guided, steered, influenced the politicians to boil over,
one way or t'other, and Paris and the Terror followed, dogged by
Napoleon, trailed by the Paris Commune in which Haussmann, taking
advantage of the chaos, tore down and rebuilt the City to the madness of
some delight of others. Consider Dresden, London, Tokyo, Hiroshima. We
architects paid cold cash to get Hitler out of jail in 1922! Then we
architect mosquito-pestered the Japanese to invade Manchuria, import
junk iron, antagonize Roosevelt, bomb Pearl Harbor. Sure, the Emperor
approved, sure the Generals knew delight, sure the kamikazes
took off for oblivion, joyously happy. But behind the scenes, we
architects, clapping hands, rubbing palms for the moola, shoved them up!
Not the politicians, not the military, not the arms merchants, but the
sons of Haussmann and the future sons of Frank Lloyd Wright sent them on
there way. Glory hallelujah!"
Hank Gibson exhaled a great gust and sat weighted with an ounce of
information and a ton
of confusion, at the head of this table. He stared down its length.
"There were meetings here-"
"In 1932, 1936, 1939 to fester Tokyo, poison Washington for war. And at
the same time make sure that San Francisco was built in the best way for
a new downfall, and that California cities all up and down the cracks
and seams nursed at the mother fault, San Andreas, so when the Big One
came, it would rain money for forty days."
"Son of a bitch," said Hank Gibson.
"Yes, aren't I? Aren't we?"
"Son of a bitch," Hank Gibson repeated in a whisper. "Man's wars and
God's earthquakes."
"What a collaboration, eh? All done by the secret government, the
government of surprise architects across the world and into the next
century."
The floor shook. The table and the chair and the ceiling did likewise.
"Time?" said Hank Gibson.
Charlie Crowe laughed, glancing at his watch.
''Time. Out!''
They ran for the door, ran down the hall past the doors marked TOKYO and
London and Dresden, past the doors marked 1789 and 1870 and 1940 and
past the doors marked ARMENIA and MEXICO CITY and SAN Francisco and shot
up in the elevator, and along the way, Hank Gibson said:
"Again, why've you told me this?"
"I'm retiring. The others are gone. We won't use this place again. It'll
be gone. Maybe now.
You write the book about all this fabulous stuff, I edit it, we'll grab
the money and run."
"But who'll believe it!?"
"No one. But it's so sensational, everyone will buy. Millions of copies.
And no one will investigate, for they're all guilty, city fathers,
Chambers of Commerce, real estate salesmen, Army generals who thought
they made up and fought their own wars, or made up and built their own
cities! Pompous freaks! Here we are. Out."
They made it out of the elevator and the shack as the next quake came.
Both fell and got up, with nervous laughter.
"Good old California, yes? Is my Rolls still there? Yep. No carjackers.
In!"
With his hand on the Rolls doorframe, Gibson stared over at his friend.
"Does the San Andreas Fault come through this block?"
"You better believe. Wanna go see your home?"
Gibson shut his eyes. "Christ, I'm afraid."
"Take courage from the insurance policy in your coat pocket. Shall we
go?"
"In a moment." Gibson swallowed hard "What will we name our book?"
"What time is it and date?"
Gibson looked at the sun about to rise. "Early Six-thirty. And the date
on my watch reads February fifth."
"Nineteen ninety-four?"
'Six-thirty a.m. February fifth, 1994."
'Then that's the title of our book. Or why not
Zaharoff add Richter for the earthquake Richter scale at
Cal-Tech. Zaharoff/Richter Mark V? Okay?"
"Okay."
The doors slammed. The motor roared.
" Do we go home?" "Go fast. Jesus. Fast." They went.
 Fast.
REMEMBER SASCHA?
Remember? Why, how could they forget? Although they knew him for only a
little while, years later his name would arise and they would smile or
even laugh and reach out to hold hands, remembering.
Sascha. What a tender, witty comrade, what a sly, hidden individual,
what a child of talent; teller of tales, bon vivant, late-night
companion, ever-present illumination on foggy noons.
Sascha!
He, whom they had never seen, to whom they spoke often at three a.m. in
their small bedroom, away from friends who might roll their eyeballs
under their lids, doubting their sanity, hearing his name.
Well, then, who and what was Sascha, and where did they meet or perhaps
only dream him, and who were they?
Quickly: they were Maggie and Douglas Spaulding and they lived by the
loud sea and the
warm sand and the rickety bridges over the almost dead canals of Venice,
California. Though lacking money in the bank or Goodwill furniture in
their tiny two-room apartment, they were incredibly happy. He was a
writer, and she worked to support him while he finished the great
American novel.
Their routine was: she would arrive home each night from downtown Los
Angeles and he would have hamburgers waiting or they would walk down the
beach to eat hot dogs, spend ten or twenty cents in the Penny Arcade, go
home, make love, go to sleep, and repeat the whole wondrous routine the
next night: hot dogs, Penny Arcade, love, sleep, work, etc. It was all
glorious in that year of being very young and in love; therefore it
would go on forever
Until he appeared.
The nameless one. For then he had no name. He had threatened to arrive a
few months after their marriage to destroy their economy and scare off
the novel, but then he had melted away, leaving only his echo of a
threat.
But now the true collision loomed.
One night over a ham omelet with a bottle of cheap red and the
conversation loping quietly, leaning on the card table and promising
each other grander and more ebullient futures, Maggie suddenly said, "I
feel faint."
"What?" said Douglas Spaulding.
"I've felt funny all day. And I was sick, a little bit, this morning."
"Oh, my God." He rose and came around the card table and took her head
in his hands and pressed her brow against his side, and looked down at
the beautiful part in her hair, suddenly smiling.
"Well, now," he said, "don't tell me that Sascha is back?"
"Sascha! Who's that?"
"When he arrives, he'll tell us."
"Where did that name come from?"
"Don't know. It's been in my mind all year."
"Sascha?" She pressed his hands to her cheeks, laughing. "Sascha!"
"Call the doctor tomorrow," he said.
"The doctor says Sascha has moved in for light housekeeping," she said
over the phone the next day.
"Great!" He stopped. "I guess." He considered their bank deposits.
"No. First thoughts count. Great! When do we meet the Martian invader?"
"October. He's infinitesimal now, tiny, I can barely hear his voice. But
now that he has a name, I hear it. He promises to grow, if we take
care."
"The Fabulous Invalid! Shall I stock up on carrots, spinach, broccoli
for what date?"
"Halloween."
"Impossible!"
"True!"
"People will claim we planned him and my vampire book to arrive that
week, things that go bump and cry in the night."
"Oh, Sascha will surely do that! Happy?"
"Frightened, yes, but happy, Lord, yes. Come home, Mrs. Rabbit, and
bring him along!"
It must be explained that Maggie and Douglas Spaulding were best
described as crazed roman-tics. Long before the interior christening of
Sascha, they, loving Laurel and Hardy, had called each other Stan and
Ollie. The machines, the dustbusters and can openers around the
apartment, had names, as did various parts of their anatomy, revealed to
no one.
So Sascha, as an entity, a presence growing toward friendship, was not
unusual. And when he actually began to speak up, they were not
surprised. The gentle demands of their marriage, with love as currency
instead of cash, made it inevitable.
Someday, they said, if they owned a car, it too would be named.
They spoke on that and a dozen score of things late at night. When
hyperventilating about life, they propped themselves up on their pillows
as if the future might happen right now. They waited, anticipating, in
seance, for the silent small offspring to speak his first words before
dawn.
"I love our lives," said Maggie, lying there, "all the games. I hope it
never stops. You're not like other men, who drink beer and talk poker.
Dear God, I wonder, how many other marriages play like us?"
"No one, nowhere. Remember?"
"What?"
He lay back to trace his memory on the ceiling. "The day we were
married-"
"Yes!"
"Our friends driving and dropping us off here and we walked down to the
drugstore by the pier and bought a tube of toothpaste and two
toothbrushes, big bucks, for our honeymoon . . . ? One red toothbrush,
one green, to decorate our empty bathroom. And on the way back along the
beach, holding hands, suddenly, behind us, two little girls and a boy
followed us and sang:
"Happy marriage day to you, Happy marriage day to you.
Happy marriage day, happy marriage day, Happy marriage day to you...
She sang it now, quietly. He chimed in, remembering how they had blushed
with pleasure at the children's voices, but walked on, feeling
ridiculous but happy and wonderful.
"How did they guess? Did we look married?"
"It wasn't our clothes! Our faces, don't you think? Smiles that made our
jaws ache. We were exploding. They got the concussion."
"Those dear children. I can still hear their voices."
"And so here we are, seventeen months later." He put his arm around her
and gazed at their future on the dark ceiling.
"'And here I am," a voice murmured.
"Who?" Douglas said.
"Me," the voice whispered. "Sascha."
Douglas looked down at his wife's mouth, which had barely trembled.
"So, at last, you've decided to speak?" said Douglas.
"Yes," came the whisper.
"We wondered," said Douglas, "when we would hear from you." He squeezed
his wife gently.
"It's time," the voice murmured. "So here I am."
"Welcome, Sascha," both said.
"Why didn't you talk sooner?" asked Douglas Spaulding.
"I wasn't sure that you liked me," the voice whispered.
"Why would you think that?"
"First I was, then I wasn't. Once I was only a name. Remember, last
year, I was ready to come and stay. Scared you."
"We were broke," said Douglas quietly. "And nervous."
"What's so scary about life?" said Sascha. Maggie's lips twitched. "It's
that other thing. Not being, ever. Not being wanted."
"On the contrary." Douglas Spaulding moved down on his pillow so he
could watch his wife's profile, her eyes shut, but her mouth breathing
softly. "We love you. But last year it was bad timing. Understand?"
"No," whispered Sascha. "I only understand
you didn't want me. And now you do. I should leave."
"But you just got here!"
"Here I go, anyway."
Don't, Sascha! Stay!"
"Good-bye." The small voice faded. "Oh, good-bye."
And then silence. Maggie opened her eyes with "Sascha's gone," she said.
"He can't be!" The room was still.
"Can't be," he said. "It's only a game."
"More than a game. Oh, God, I feel cold. Hold me."
He moved to hug her.
"It's okay."
"No. I had the funniest feeling just now, as if he were real."
"He is. He's not gone."
"Unless we do something. Help me."
"Help?" He held her even tighter, then shut his eyes, and at last
called:
"Sascha?"
Silence.
"I know you're there. You can't hide."
His hand moved to where Sascha might be.
"Listen. Say something. Don't scare us, Sascha. We don't want to be
scared or scare you. We need each other. We three against the world.
Sascha?"
Silence.
"Well?" whispered Douglas.
      Maggie breathed in and out.
They waited.
"Yes?"
There was a soft flutter, the merest exhalation on the night air.
"Yes."
"You're back!" both cried.
Another silence.
"Welcome?" asked Sascha.
"Welcome!" both said.
And that night passed and the next day and the night and day after that,
until there were many days, but especially midnights when he dared to
declare himself, pipe opinions, grow stronger and firmer and longer in
half-heard declarations, as they lay in anticipatory awareness, now she
moving her lips, now he taking over, both open as warm, live
ventriloquists' mouthpieces. The small voice shifted from one tongue to
the other, with soft bouts of laughter at how ridiculous but loving it
all seemed, never knowing what Sascha might say next, but letting him
speak on until dawn and a smiling sleep.
"What's this about Halloween?" he asked, somewhere in the sixth month.
"Halloween?" both wondered.
"Isn't that a death holiday?" Sascha murmured.
"Well, yes . .
"I'm not sure I want to be born on a night
  like that."
"Well, what night would you like to be born on?"
Silence as Sascha floated a while.
"Guy Fawkes," he finally whispered.
"Guy Fawkes??!!"
"That's mainly fireworks, gunpowder plots, Houses of Parliament,
yes? Please to remember the fifth of November?"
"Do you think you could wait until then?"
"I could try. I don't think I want to start out with skulls and bones.
Gunpowder's more like it. I could write about that."
"Will you be a writer, then?"
"Get me a typewriter and a ream of paper."
"And keep us awake with the typing?"
"Pen, pencil, and pad, then?"
"Done!"
So it was agreed and the nights passed into weeks and the weeks leaned
from summer into the first days of autumn and his voice grew stronger,
as did the sound of his heart and the small commotions of his limbs.
Sometimes as Maggie slept, his voice would stir her awake and she would
reach up to touch her mouth, where the surprise of his dreaming came
forth.
"There, there, Sascha. Rest now. Sleep."
"Sleep," he whispered drowsily, "sleep." And faded away.
"Pork chops, please, for supper."
"No pickles with ice cream?" both said, almost at once.
"Pork chops," he said, and more days passed and more dawns arose and he
said: "Hamburgers!"
"For breakfast?"
"With onions," he said.
October stood still for one day and then...
Halloween departed.
"Thanks," said Sascha, "for helping me past that. What's up ahead in
five nights?"
"Guy Fawkes!"
"Ah, yes!" he cried.
And at one minute after midnight five days later, Maggie got up,
wandered to the bathroom, and wandered back, stunned.
"Dear," she said, sitting on the edge of the bed.
Douglas Spaulding turned over, half awake. "Yes?"
"What day is it?" whispered Sascha.
"Guy Fawkes, at last. So?"
"I don't feel well," said Sascha. "Or, no, I feel fine. Full of pep.
Ready to go. It's time to say good-bye. Or is it hello? What do I mean?"
"Spit it out."
"Are there neighbors who said, no matter when, they'd take us to the
hospital?"
''Yes.''
"Call the neighbors," said Sascha.
They called the neighbors.
At the hospital, Douglas kissed his and listened.
"It's been nice," said Sascha.
"Only the best."
"We won't talk again. Good-bye,"
said Sascha.
"Good-bye," both said.
At dawn there was a small clear cry somewhere. Not long after, Douglas
entered his wife's hospital room. She looked at him and said
 "Sascha's gone."
"I know," he said quietly.
"But he left word and someone else is here.
Look."
He approached the bed as she pulled back a coverlet.
"Well, I'll be damned."
He looked down at a small pink face and eyes that for a brief moment
flickered bright blue and
then shut.
"Who's that?" he asked.
"Your daughter. Meet Alexandra."
"Hello, Alexandra," he said.
"And do you know what the nickname for Alexandra is?" she said.
"What?''
"Sascha," she said.
He touched the small cheek very gently.
"Hello, Sascha," he said.
ANOTHER FINE MESS
The sounds began in the middle of summer in the middle of the night.
Bella Winters sat up in bed about three a.m. and listened and then lay
back down. Ten minutes later she heard the sounds again, out in the
night, down the hill.
Bella Winters lived in a first-floor apartment on top of Vendome
Heights, near Effie Street in Los Angeles, and had lived there now for
only a few days, so it was all new to her, this old house on an old
street with an old staircase, made of concrete, climbing steeply
straight up from the low-lands below, one hundred and twenty steps,
count them. And right now ...
"Someone's on the steps," said Bella to herself.
"What?" said her husband, Sam, in his sleep.
"There are some men out on the steps," said Bella. "Talking, yelling,
not fighting, but almost. I heard them last night, too, and the night
before, but . .
"What?" Sam muttered.
"Shh, go to sleep. I'll look."
She got out of bed in the dark and went to the window, and yes, two men
were indeed talking out there, grunting, groaning, now loud, now soft.
And there was another noise, a kind of bumping, sliding, thumping, like
a huge object being carted up the hill.
"No one could be moving in at this hour of the night, could they?" asked
Bella of the darkness, the window, and herself.
"No," murmured Sam.
"It sounds like . .
"Like what?" asked Sam, fully awake now.
"Like two men moving-"
"Moving what, for God's sake?"
"Moving a piano. Up those steps.''
"At three in the morning!?"
"A piano and two men. Just listen."
The husband sat up, blinking, alert.
Far off, in the middle of the hill, there was a kind harping strum, the
noise a piano makes when suddenly thumped and its harp strings hum.
"There, did you hear?"
"Jesus, you're right. But why would anyone steal-"
"They're not stealing, they're delivering."
"A piano?"
"I didn't make the rules, Sam. Go out and ask. No, don’t; I will."
And she wrapped herself in her robe and was out the door and on the
sidewalk.
"Bella," Sam whispered fiercely behind the porch screen. "Crazy."
"So what can happen at night to a woman fifty-five, fat, and ugly?" she
wondered.
Sam did not answer.
She moved quietly to the rim of the hill. Somewhere down there she could
hear the two men wrestling with a huge object. The piano on occasion
gave a strumming hum and fell silent. occasionally one of the men yelled
or gave orders.
"The voices," said Bella. "I know them from somewhere," she whispered
and moved in utter dark on stairs that were only a long pale ribbon
going down, as a voice echoed:
"Here's another fine mess you've got us in." Bella froze. Where have I
heard that voice, she wondered, a million times!
"Hello," she called.
She moved, counting the steps, and stopped.
And there was no one there.
Suddenly she was very cold. There was nowhere for the strangers to have
gone to. The hill was steep and a long way down and a long way up, and
they had been burdened with an upright piano, hadn't they?
How come I know upright? she thought. I
only heard. But-yes, upright! Not only that, but inside a box!
She turned slowly and as she went back up the steps, one by one, slowly,
slowly, the voices began to sound again, below, as if, disturbed, they
had waited for her to go away.
"What are you doing?" demanded one voice.
"I was just-" said the other.
"Give me that!" cried the first voice.
That other voice, thought Bella, I know that, too. And I know what's
going to be said next!
"Now," said the echo far down the hill in the night, "just don't stand
there, help me!"
"Yes!" Bella closed her eyes and swallowed hard and half fell to sit on
the steps, getting her breath back as black-and-White pictures flashed
in her head. Suddenly it was 1929 and she Was very small, in a theater
with dark and light pictures looming above the first row where she sat,
transfixed, and then laughing, and then transfixed and laughing again.
She opened her eyes. The two voices were still down there, a faint
wrestle and echo in the night, despairing and thumping each other with
their hard derby hats.
Zelda, thought Bella Winters. I'll call Zelda. She knows everything.
She'll tell me what this is. Zelda, yes!
Inside, she dialed Z and E and L and D and A before she saw what she had
done and started over. The phone rang a long while until Zelda's voice,
angry with sleep, spoke half way across L.A.
"Zelda, this is Bella!"
"Sam just died?"
"No, no, I'm sorry-
" You're sorry?"
"Zelda, I know you're going to think I'm crazy, but . . ."
 "Go ahead, be crazy."
"Zelda, in the old days when they made films around L.A., they used lots
of places, right? Like Venice, Ocean Park . . . "
"Chaplin did, Langdon did, Harold Lloyd, sure."
"Laurel and Hardy?"
"What?"
"Laurel and Hardy, did they use lots of locations?"
"Palms, they used Palms lots, Culver City Main Street,' Effie Street."
"Effie Street!"
"Don't yell, Bella."
"Did you say Effie Street?"
"Sure, and God, it's three in the morning!"
"Right at the top of Effie Street!?"
"Hey, yeah, the stairs. Everyone knows them. That's
where the music box chased Hardy downhill and ran over Him.”
“Sure, Zelda, sure! Oh, God, Zelda, if you could see, hear,
what I hear! "
Zelda was suddenly wide awake on the line. "What's
going on? You serious?"
"oh, God, yes. On the steps just now, and last night and the night
before maybe, I heard, I hear--two men hauling
a--a piano up the hill."
"Someone's pulling your leg!"
"No, no, they're there. I go out and there's nothing. But the steps are
haunted, Zelda! One voice says: 'Here's another fine mess you've got us
in.' You got to hear that man's voice!"
"You're drunk and doing this because you know I'm a nut for them."
"No, no. Come, Zelda. Listen. Tell!"
Maybe half an hour later, Bella heard the old tin lizzie rattle up the
alley behind the apartments. It was a car Zelda, in her joy at visiting
silent-movie theaters, had bought to lug herself around in while she
wrote about the past, always the past, and steaming into Cecil B.
DeMille's old place or circling Harold Lloyd's nation-state, or cranking
and banging around the Universal backlot, paying her respects to the
Phantom's opera stage, or sitting on Ma and Pa Kettle's porch chewing a
sandwich lunch. That was Zelda, who once wrote in a silent country in a
silent time for Silver Screen.
Zelda lumbered across the front porch, a huge body with legs as big as
the Bernini columns in front of St. Peter's in Rome, and a face like a
harvest moon.
On that round face now was suspicion, cynicism, skepticisms, in equal
pie-parts. But when she saw Bella's pale stare she cried:
"Belle! "
"You see I'm not lying!" said Bella.
"I see!"
"Keep your voice down, Zelda. Oh, it's scary and strange, terrible and
nice. So come on."
And the two women edged along the walk to the rim of the old hill near
the old steps in old Hollywood, and suddenly as they moved they felt
time take a half turn around them and it was another year, because
nothing had changed all the buildings were the way they were in 1928 and
the hills beyond like they were in 1926 and the steps, just the, way
they were when the cement was poured in 1921.
"Listen, Zelda. There!"
And Zelda listened and at first there was only a creaking of wheels down
in the dark, like crickets, and then a moan of wood and a hum of piano
strings, and then one voice lamenting about this job, and the other
voice claiming he had nothing to do with it, and then the thumps as two
derby hats fell, and an exasperated voice announced:
"Here's another fine mess you've got us in."
Zelda, stunned, almost toppled off the hill. She held tight to Bella's
arm as tears brimmed in her eyes.
"It's a trick. Someone's got a tape recorder or-"
"No, I checked. Nothing but the steps, Zelda, the steps!"
Tears rolled down Zelda's plump cheeks.
"Oh, God, that is his voice! I'm the expert, I'm the mad, fanatic,
Bella. That's Ollie. And that other voice, Stan! And you're not nuts
after all!"
The voices below rose and fell and one cried: "Why don't you do
something to help me?"
Zelda moaned. "Oh, God, it's so beautiful."
"What does it mean?" asked Bella. "Why are they here? Are they really
ghosts, and why would ghosts climb this hill every night, pushing that
music box, night after night, tell me, Zelda, why?"
Zelda peered down the hill and shut her eyes for a moment to think. "Why
do any ghosts go anywhere? Retribution? Revenge? No, not those two. Love
maybe's the reason, lost loves or something Yes?"
Bella let her heart pound once or twice and then said, "Maybe
nobody told them."
"Told them what?"
"Or maybe they were told a lot but still didn't believe, because maybe
in their old years things got bad, I mean they were sick, and sometimes
when you're sick you forget."
"Forget what!?"
"How much we loved them."
"They knew!"
"Did they? Sure, we told each other, but maybe not enough of us ever
wrote or waved when they passed and just yelled 'Love!' you think?"
"Hell, Bella, they're on TV every night!"
"Yeah, but that don't count. Has anyone, since they left us, come here
to these steps and said? Maybe those voices down there, ghosts or
whatever, have been here every night for years, pushing that music box,
and nobody thought, or tried, to just whisper or yell all the love we
had all the years. Why not?"
'Why not?" Zelda stared down into the long darkness where perhaps
shadows moved and maybe a piano lurched clumsily among the shadows.
"You're right."
If I'm right," said Bella, "and you say so, there's only one thing to
do-"
"You mean you and me?"
"Who else? Quiet. Come on."
They moved down a step. In the same instant lights came
on around them, in a window here, another there. A screen door opened
somewhere and angry words shot out into the night:
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Pipe down!"
"You know what time it is?"  "My God," Bella whispered,
"everyone else hears now!"
"No, no." Zelda looked around wildly. "They'll spoil everything!"
"I'm calling the cops!" A window slammed.
"God," said Bella, "if the cops come-"
"What?"
"It'll be all wrong. If anyone's going to tell them to take it easy,
pipe down, it's gotta be us. We care, don't we?"
"God, yes, but-"
"No buts. Grab on. Here we go."
The two voices murmured below and the piano tuned itself with hiccups of
sound as they edged down another step and another, their mouths dry,
hearts hammering, and the night so dark they could see only the faint
streetlight at the stair bottom, the single street illumination so far
away it was sad being there all by itself, waiting for shadows to move.
More windows slammed up, more screen doors opened. At any moment there
would be an avalanche of protest, incredible outcries, perhaps shots
fired, and all this gone forever.
Thinking this, the women trembled and held tight, as if
to pummel each other to speak against the rage.
"Say something, Zelda, quick."
" What?"
"Anything! They'll get hurt if we don't-"
" They?"
"You know what I mean. Save them."
“Okay. Jesus!" Zelda froze, clamped her eyes shut to find the words,
then opened her eyes and said, "Hello."
"Louder. "
`'Hello," Zelda called softly, then loudly.
Shapes rustled in the dark below. One of the voices rose while the other
fell and the piano strummed its hidden harp strings.
"Don't be afraid," Zelda called
"That's good. Go on."
"Don't be afraid," Zelda called, braver now. "Don't listen to those
others yelling. We won't hurt you. It's just us. I'm Zelda, you wouldn't
remember, and this here is Bella, and we've known you forever, or since
we were kids, and we love you. It's late, but we thought you should
know. We've loved you ever since you were in the desert or on that boat
with ghosts or trying to sell Christmas trees door-to-door or in that
traffic where you tore the headlights off cars, and we still love you,
right, Bella?"
The night below was darkness, waiting.
Zelda punched Bella's arm.
"Yes!" Bella cried, "what she said. We love you."
"We can't think of anything else to say."
"But it's enough, yes?" Bella leaned forward anxiously. "It's enough?"
A night wind stirred the leaves and grass around the stairs and the
shadows below that had stopped moving with the music box suspended
between them as they looked up and up at the two women, who suddenly
began to cry. First tears fell from Bella's cheeks, and when Zelda
sensed them, she let fall her own.
So now,'' said Zelda, amazed that she could form words but managed to
speak anyway, "we want you to know, you don t have to come back anymore.
You don't have to climb
the hill every night, waiting. For what we said just now is it, isn't
it? I mean you wanted to hear it here on this hill, with those steps,
and that piano, yes, that's the whole thing, it had to be that, didn't
it? So now here we are and there you are and it's said. So rest, dear
friends."
"Oh, there, Ollie,"," added Bella in a sad, sad whisper. "Oh, Stan,
Stanley."
The piano, hidden in the dark, softly hummed its wires and creaked its
ancient wood.
And then the most incredible thing happened. There was: a series of
shouts and then a huge banging crash as the music box, in the dark,
rocketed down the hill, skittering on the steps, playing chords where it
hit, swerving, rushing, and ahead of it, running, the two shapes pursued
by the musical beast, yelling, tripping, shouting, warning the Fates,
crying out to the gods, down and down, forty, sixty, eighty, one hundred
steps.
And half down the steps, hearing, feeling, shouting, crying themselves,
and now laughing and holding to each other, the two women alone in the
night wildly clutching, grasping, trying to see, almost sure that
they did see, the three things ricocheting off and away, the two shadows
rushing, one fat,, one thin, and the piano blundering after, discordant
and mindless, until they reached the street, where, instantly, the one
overhead streetlamp died as if struck, and the shadows floundered on,
pursued by the musical beast.
And the two women, abandoned, looked down, exhausted with laughing until
they wept and weeping until they laughed, until suddenly Zelda got a
terrible look on her face as if shot.
"My God!" she shouted in panic, reaching out. "Wait. We didn't mean, we
don't want-don't go forever! Sure, go. so the neighbors here sleep. But
once a year, you hear? Once
a year, one night a year from tonight, and every year after that, come
back. It shouldn't bother anyone so much. But we got to tell you all
over again, huh? Come back and bring the box with you, and we'll be here
waiting, won't we, Bella?"
"Waiting, yes."
There was a long silence from the steps leading down into an old
black-and-white, silent Los Angeles.
"You think they heard?"
They listened.
And from somewhere far off and down, there was the faintest explosion
like the engine of an old jalopy knocking itself to life, and then the
merest whisper of a lunatic music from a dark theater when they were
very young. It faded.
After a long while they climbed back up the steps, dabbing at their eyes
with wet Kleenex. Then they turned for a final time to stare down into
the night.
"You know something?" said Zelda. "I think they heard."
THE ELECTROCUTION
She let him tie the black silk over her eyes and he knotted
it and jerked it so tight that she gasped and said, "Loosen
it, damn you, Johnny, loosen it, or I won't go on!'?
"Sure," he said easily, and she smelled his sharp breath;
while beyond; the crowd rustled against the rope barrier and
the carnival tent flapped in the night wind, and off, there
was a drift of calliope music and the rattle of a trap drum.
Dimly, through the black silk, she could see the men, the boys, the few
women, a good crowd, paying out dimes to
see her strapped in this electric chair,  the electrodes on her
wrists and neck, waiting.
"There." Johnny's voice whispered through the blindfold. "That better?"
She said nothing, but her hands gripped the ends of the
wooden chair. She felt her pulse beating in her arms and
neck.. Outside the pitchman yelled through his small cardboard
megaphone and slapped his cane across the banner
where Electra's portrait shivered in the wind: yellow hair,
hard blue eyes, sharp chin, seated in her death-chair like
Someone come for tea.
With the black silk blinding her, it was easier to let her mind run back
to wherever it wanted to go . . .
The carnival was either setting up in a new town or letting go; its
brown tents inhaling by day, exhaling its stale air by night as the
canvases slid rustling down along the dark poles. And then?
Last Monday night this young man with the long arms and the eager pink
face bought three tickets to the sideshow and stood watching Electra
three times as the electricity burned through her like blue fire while
this young man strained at the rope barrier, and memorized her every
move as she sat high up there on the platform, all fire and pale flesh.
He came four nights in a row.
"You got an audience, Ellie," said Johnny on the third night.
"So I see," she said.
"Don't pay no attention," said Johnny.
"I won't," she said. "Why should I? Don't worry."
After all, she'd done the act for years. Johnny slammed on the power,
and it filled her from ankle to elbows to ears as he handed her the
bright sword and she thrust it out blindly over the audience, smiling
under her half mask, to let them tap shoulders and brows as the blue
sparks crackled and spat. On the fourth night she shoved the sword far
out toward the young man with the sweating pink face, first among the
crowd. The young man raised his hand swiftly, eagerly, as if to seize
the blade. Blue sparks leaped the gap, but his hand didn't flinch or
stop as he grabbed on and took the fire in his fingers and then his fist
and then his wrist and his arm into his body.
His eyes, in the light, flared with blue alcohol flame, fed by the
sword, whose fire in passing lit her arm and face and body. He stretched
his hand still farther out, his waist jammed against the rope, silent
and tense. Then Johnny cried, "Everybody touch it! Every one!" And
Electra lifted the blade out on the air for others to feel and stroke,
while Johnny cursed. Through the blindfold she saw the terrible
illumination which would not leave the young man's face.
The fifth night, instead of touching the young man's fingers, she tapped
the blazing tip of the sword against the palm of his hand, brushing and
burning until he shut his eyes.
That night she walked out on the lake pier after the show and did not
look back as she moved, but listened and began to smile. The lake shook
against the rotting piles. The carnival lights made wandering, uneasy
roads on the black water. The Ferris wheel whirled high and around, with
its faint screams, and far away the calliope steamed and sobbed
"Beautiful Ohio." She slowed her walking. She put out her right foot,
slowly, then her left, then she stopped and turned her head. And as she
turned she saw the shadow, and his arms moved around her. A long time
later she leaned back in his arms and stared up into his healthy,
excited pink face, and said, "My God, you're more dangerous than my
chair!"
"Is your name really Electra?" he said.
The next night as the power leaped through her, she stiffened,
shuddered, and clamped her lips in her teeth, moaning. Her legs stirred;
her hands groped and scratched the chair arms.
"What's wrong!" Beyond the blindfold, Johnny cried out, "What?"
And cut the power.
"I'm all right," she gasped. The crowd murmured. "It's nothing Go on!
Now!"
And he hit the switch.
The fire crawled through her and again she clenched her teeth and threw
her head back against the chair. A face rushed out of the dark, and a
body with it, to press against her. The power exploded. The electric
chair stopped, then melted.
Johnny, a million miles off in the dark, handed her the sword. Her limp,
twitching hand dropped it. He handed it back and instinctively she
shoved it far out into the night.
Someone, out there in the roaring darkness, touched the blade. She could
imagine his eyes burning there, his lips parted as the power jolted him.
He was pressed against the rope, hard, hard against the rope, and could
not breathe or cry out or pull back!
The power died. The smell of lightning stayed.
"That's it!" someone cried.
Johnny left her to squirm out of the leather straps, jumped off the low
platform, and walked out toward the midway. Convulsively, she tore off
the bonds, trembling. She ran from the tent, not looking back to see if
the young man was still there against the rope.
She fell upon the cot of the trailer behind the tent, perspiring and
shaking, and was still crying when Johnny stepped in to look down at
her.
"What's the matter?" he said.
"Nothing, nothing, Johnny."
"What was that you pulled out there just now?"
"Nothing, nothing."
"Nothing, nothing," he said. "Like hell it is." His face twisted. "Like
hell! You haven't done anything like that for years!"
"I was nervous!"
"Years it's been," he said. "When we were first married you did that.
You think I forgot how when I switched the power on this same happened
like tonight? You been sitting in that chair for three years like
someone listening to a radio. And tonight, and tonight!"he cried,
choking, standing over her, his fists tightened. "Damn it, tonight."
"Please, please, Johnny. I was nervous."
"What were you thinking there in the chair?" he demanded, leaning down
wildly. "What did you think about?"
"Nothing, Johnny, nothing. " He grabbed her hair. "Please!"
He threw her head down, turned, walked out, and stopped outside. "I know
what you were thinking," he said. "I know." And she heard his footsteps
fade away.
And the night passed and the day and another night with another crowd.
But nowhere in the crowd did she see his face. Now, in the blackness,
with the blindfold tight to her face, she sat in the electric chair and
waited while Johnny described the wonders of the Skeleton Man over on
the next platform, and still she waited and stared at everyone who
entered the tent. Johnny walked around the Skeleton Man, all stiffness,
describing the living skull and the terrible bones, and at last the
crowd rustled, turned, led by Johnny, his voice like a battered brass
horn as he jumped up onto the platform with her so violently that she
jerked aside and licked her red lips.
And now the knot of the blindfold was tied tighter and yet tighter as he
bent to whisper:
"Miss him?"
She said nothing, but held her head up. The crowd stirred below, like
animals in a straw stable.
"He's not here," he whispered and locked the electrodes on her arms. She
was silent. He whispered again, "He'll never come back." He fitted the
black skullcap over her hair. She trembled. "Afraid?" he wondered
quietly. "What of?" He snapped the straps around her ankles. "Don't be
afraid. Good clean electricity." A gasp escaped her lips. He stood up.
"I hit him," he said softly, touching her blindfold. "Hit him so hard I
broke his front teeth. Then I knocked him against a wall and hit him
again and again-" He Stopped and shouted. "Ladies and gentlemen, witness
the most astounding act in carnival history! Here you see a penitentiary
electric chair exactly like those used in our biggest prisons. Perfect
for the destruction of criminals!" With this last word she fell forward,
fingers scratching the wood as he cried, "Before your very eyes, this
dear lady will be
electrocuted!"
The crowd murmured, and she thought of the tesla transformer under the
platform and how Johnny might have fixed it so she got amperage, not
voltage. Accident, bad accident Shame. Amperage, not voltage.
She wrenched her right hand free of its leather strap and heard the
power switch slam shut as the blue fire seized and shook her, screaming!
The audience applauded and whistled and stomped. Oh she thought wildly,
this is good, my death? Great! More applause! More screams!
Out of the black spaces a body fell. "Hit him so hard broke his teeth!"
The body jerked. "Then I hit him and hit him again!" The body fell, was
picked up, fell again. She screamed high and long as a million unseen
mouths stung and bit her. Blue flames seized her heart. The young man'
body writhed and exploded in bone shrapnel, flame, and ash
Calmly, Johnny handed her the sword.
"Now," he said.
Being safe was like a blow to the stomach.
She sobbed, fumbling at the sword, quivering and jerking unable to move.
The power hummed and the crowd stuck out their hands, some like spiders,
some like birds leaping away wherever the sword sizzled and spat.
The power still lived in her bones as all over the carnival grounds the
lights dimmed.
Click. The switch lay in its Off bed.
She sank in upon herself, the sweat running around her nose and her
sagging mouth. Gasping, she fought free to pull the blindfold away.
The crowd had gone off to another platform, another miracle, where the
Fat Lady called and they obeyed.
Johnny's hand lay on the switch. He dropped his hand, stood there
watching her, his dark eyes cold, not flickering.
The tent lights looked dirty, old, yellow, and unclean. She stared
blindly at the retreating crowd, Johnny, the tent, the lights. She
looked shrunken in the chair. Half of her had poured out through the
wires, flushed into the copper cable that fled over the town, leaping
from high pole to pole. She lifted her head as if it weighed ninety
pounds. The clean light had come, entered into and slid through her, and
blasted out again; but it was not the same light anymore. She had
changed it; she saw how she had made it. And she shivered because the
light was discolored.
Johnny's mouth opened. She didn't hear him at first. He had to repeat
what had to be said.
"You're dead," he said firmly. And again: "You're dead."
And sitting there in the electric chair, trapped by the leather straps,
with a wind from the tent flaps playing over her face, evaporating the
wetness, staring at him and seeing the dark in his eyes, she gave the
only answer it was possible to give.
"Yes," she said, eyes shut. "Oh, yes. I am."
HOPSCOTCH
 Vinia woke to the sound of a rabbit running down and across an endless
moonlit field; but it was only the soft, quick beating of her heart. She
lay on the bed for a moment, getting her breath. Now the sound of the
running faded and was gone at a great distance. At last she sat up and
looked down from her second-story bedroom window and there below, on the
long sidewalk, in the faint moonlight before dawn, was the hopscotch.
Late yesterday, some child had chalked it out, immense and endlessly
augmented, square upon square, line after line, numeral following
numeral. You could not see the end of it. Down the street it built its
crazy pattern, 3, 4, 5, on up to 10, then 30, 50, 90, on away to turn
far corners. Never in all the children's world a hopscotch like this!
You could Jump forever toward the horizon.
Now in the very early, very quiet morning, her eyes traveled and jumped,
paused and hopped, along that presumptuous ladder of chalk-scratches and
she heard herself whisper:
"Sixteen. "
But she did not run on from there.
The next square waited, she knew, with the scribbled blue chalk 17, but
her mind flung out its arms and balanced, teetering, poised with her
numb foot planted across the 1 and the 6, and could go no further.
Trembling, she lay back down.
The room was like the bottom of a cool well all night and she lay in it
like a white stone in a well, enjoying it, floating in the dark yet
clear element of half dreams and half wakening. She felt the breath move
in small jets from her nostrils and she felt the immense sweep of her
eyelids shutting and opening again and again. And at last she felt the
fever brought into her room by the presence of the sun beyond the hills.
Morning, she thought. It might be a special day. After all, it's my
birthday. Anything might happen. And I hope it does.
The air moved the white curtains like a summer breath.
"Vinia . . . ?"
A voice was calling. But it couldn't be a voice. Yet-Vinia raised
herself-there it was again.
"Vinia . . . ?"
She slipped from bed and ran to the window of her high second-story
window.
There on the fresh lawn below, calling up to her in the early hour,
stood James Conway, no older than she, seventeen, very seriously
smiling, waving his hand now as her head appeared.
"Jim, what're you doing here?" she said, and thought, Does he
know what day this is?
"I've been up an hour already," he replied. "I'm going for a walk,
starting early, all day. Want to come along?"
Oh but I couldn't . . . my folks won't be back till late tonight, I'm
alone, I'm supposed to stay . . ."
She saw the green hills beyond the town and the roads leading out into
summer, leading out into August and rivers and places beyond this town
and this house and this room and this particular moment.
"I can't go . . ." she said faintly.
"I can't hear you!" he protested mildly, smiling up at her under a
shielding hand.
"Why did you ask me to walk with you, and not someone else?"
He considered this for a moment. "I don't know," he admitted. He thought
it over again, and gave her his most pleasant and agreeable look.
"Because, that's all, just because."
"I'll be down," she said.
"Hey!" he said.
But the window was empty.
They stood in the center of the perfect, jeweled lawn, over which one
set of prints, hers, had run, leaving marks, and another, his, had
walked in great slow strides to meet them. The town was silent as a
stopped clock. All the shades were still down.
"My gosh," said Vinia, "it's early. It's crazy-early. I've never been up
this early and out this early in years. Listen to everyone sleeping."
They listened to the trees and the whiteness of the houses in this early
whispering hour, the hour when mice went back to sleep and flowers began
untightening their bright fists.
"Which way do we go?"
"Pick a direction."
Vinia closed her eyes, whirled, and pointed blindly. "Which way am I
pointing?"
"North. "
She opened her eyes. "Lefts go north out of town, then. I don't suppose
we should."
"Why?"
And they walked out of town as the sun rose above the hills and the
grass burned greener on the lawns.
There was a smell of hot chalk highway, of dust and sky and waters
flowing in a creek the color of grapes. The sun was a new lemon. The
forest lay ahead with shadows stirring like a million birds under each
tree, each bird a leaf-darkness, trembling. At noon, Vinia and James
Conway had crossed vast meadows that sounded brisk and starched
underfoot. The day had grown warm, as an iced glass of tea grows warm,
the frost burning off, left in the sun.
They picked a handful of grapes from a wild barbed-wire vine. Holding
them up to the sun, you could see the clear grape thoughts suspended in
the dark amber fluid, the little hot seeds of contemplation stored from
many afternoons of solitude and plant philosophy. The grapes tasted of
fresh, clear water and something that they had saved from the morning
dews and the evening rains. They were the warmed-over flesh of April
ready now, in August, to pass on their simple gain to any passing
stranger. And the lesson was this; sit in the sun, head down, within a
prickly vine, in flickery light or open light, and the world will come
to you. The sky will come in its time, bringing rain, and the earth will
rise through you, from beneath, and make you rich and make you full.
"Have a grape," said James Conway. "Have two."
They munched their wet, full mouths.
They sat on the edge of a brook and took off their shoes and let the
water cut their feet off to the ankles with an exquisite cold razor.
My feet are gone! thought Vinia. But when she looked, there they were,
underwater, living comfortably apart from her, completely acclimated to
an amphibious existence.
They ate egg sandwiches Jim had brought with him in a paper sack.
"Vinia,'' said Jim, looking at his sandwich before he bit it. ''would
you mind if I kissed you?"
"I don't know," she said, after a moment. "I hadn't thought. "
"Will you think it over?" he asked.
"Did we come on this picnic just so you could kiss me?" she asked
suddenly.
"Oh, don't get me wrong! It's been a swell day! I don't want to spoil
it. But if you should decide, later, that it's all right for me to kiss
you, would you tell me?"
"I'll tell you," she said, starting on her second sandwich, "if I ever
decide."
The rain came as a cool surprise.
It smelled of soda water and limes and oranges and the cleanest,
freshest river in the world, made of snow-water, falling from the high,
parched sky.
First there had been a motion, as of veils, in the sky. The clouds had
enveloped each other softly. A faint breeze had lifted Vinia's hair,
sighing and evaporating the moisture from her upper lip, and then, as
she and Jim began to run, the raindrops fell down all about without
touching them and then at last began to touch them, coolly, as they
leaped green-moss logs and darted among vast trees into the deepest,
muskiest cavern of the forest. The forest sprang up in wet murmurs
overhead, every leaf ringing and painted fresh with water.
"This way!" cried Jim.
And they reached a hollow tree so vast that they could squeeze in and be
warmly cozy from the rain. They stood together, arms about each other,
the first coldness from the rain making them shiver, raindrops on their
noses and cheeks, laughing. "Hey!" He gave her brow a lick. "Drinking
water!"
"Jim!"
They listened to the rain, the soft envelopment of the world in the
velvet clearness of falling water, the whispers in deep grass, evoking
odors of old, wet wood and leaves that had lain a hundred years,
moldering and sweet.
Then they heard another sound. Above and inside the hollow warm darkness
of the tree was a constant humming, like someone in a kitchen, far away,
baking and crusting pies contentedly, dipping in sweet sugars and
snowing in baking powders, someone in a warm, dim, summer-rainy kitchen
making a vast supply of food, happy at it, humming between lips over it.
"Bees, Jim, up there! Bees!"
"Shh!"
Up the channel of moist, warm hollow they saw little yellow flickers.
Now the last bees, wettened, were hurrying home from whatever pasture or
meadow or field they had covered, dipping by Vinia and Jim, vanishing up
the warm flue of summer into hollow dark.
"They won't bother us. Just stand still."
Jim tightened his arms; Vinia tightened hers. She could smell his breath
with the wild tart grapes still on it. And the harder the rain drummed
on the tree, the tighter they held, laughing, at last quietly letting
their laughter drain away into the sound of the bees home from the far
fields. And for a moment, Vinia thought that she and Jim might be caught
by a sudden drop of great masses of honey from above, sealing them into
this tree forever, enchanted, in amber, to be seen by anyone in the next
thousand years who strolled by, while the weather of all ages rained and
thundered and turned green outside the tree.
It was so warm, so safe, so protected here, the world did not exist,
there was raining silence, in the sunless, forested day.
"Vinia," whispered Jim, after a while. "May I now?"
His face was very large, near her, larger than any face she had ever
seen.
"Yes," she said.
He kissed her.
The rain poured hard on the tree for a full minute while everything was
cold outside and everything was tree-warmth and hidden away inside.
It was a very sweet kiss. It was very friendly and comfortably warm and
it tasted like apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you
rise at night and walk into a dark, warm summer kitchen and drink from a
cool tin cup. She had never imagined that a kiss could be so sweet and
immensely tender and careful of her. He held her not as he had held her
a moment before, hard, to protect her from the green rain weather, but
he held her now as if she were a porcelain clock, very carefully and
with consideration. His eyes were closed and the lashes were glistening
dark; she saw this in the instant she opened her eyes and closed them
again.
The rain stopped.
It was a moment before the new silence shocked them into an awareness of
the climate beyond their world. Now there was nothing but the suspension
of water in all the intricate branches of the forest. Clouds moved away
to show the blue sky in great quilted patches.
They looked out at the change with some dismay. They waited for the rain
to come back, to keep them, by necessity, in this hollow tree for
another minute or an hour. But the sun appeared, shining through upon
everything, making the scene quite commonplace again.
They stepped from the hollow tree slowly and stood with their hands out,
balancing, finding their way, it seemed, in these woods where the water
was drying fast on every limb and leaf.
"I think we'd better start walking," said Vinia. "That way."
They walked off into the summer afternoon.
They crossed the town limits at sunset and walked hand in hand in the
last glowing of the summer day. They had talked very little the rest of
the afternoon, and now as they turned down one street after another,
they looked at the passing sidewalk under their feet.
"Vinia," he said at last. "Do you think this is the beginning of
something?"
"Oh, gosh, Jim, I don't know."
"Do you think maybe we're in love?"
"Oh, I don't know that either!"
They passed down into the ravine and over the bridge and up the other
side to her street.
"Do you think we'll ever be married?"
"It's too early to tell, isn't it?" she said.
"I guess you're right." He bit his lip. "Will we go walking again soon?"
'I don't know. I don't know. Let's wait and see, Jim."
The house was dark, her parents not home yet. They stood on her porch
and she shook his hand gravely.
"Thanks, Jim, for a really fine day," she said.
"You're welcome," he said.
They stood there.
Then he turned and walked down the steps and across the dark lawn. At
the far edge of lawn he stopped in the shadows and said, "Good night."
He was almost out of sight, running, when she, in turn, said good night.
In the middle of the night, a sound wakened her.
She half sat up in bed, trying to hear it again. The folks were home,
everything was locked and secure, but it hadn't been them. No, this was
a special sound. And lying there, looking out at the summer night that
had, not long ago, been a summer day, she heard the sound again, and it
was a sound of hollowing warmth and moist bark and empty, tunneled tree,
the rain outside but comfortable dryness and secretness inside, and it
was the sound of bees come home from distant fields, moving upward in
the flue of summer into wonderful darkness.
And this sound, she realized, putting her hand up in the summer-night
room to touch it, was coming from her drowsy, half-smiling mouth.
Which made her sit bolt upright, and very quietly move downstairs, out
through the door, onto the porch, and across the wet-grass lawn to the
sidewalk, where the crazed hopscotch chalked itself way off into the
future.
Her bare feet hit the first numbers, leaving moist prints up to 10 and
12, thumping, until she stopped at 16, staring down at 17, hesitating,
swaying. Then she gritted her teeth, made fists, reared back, and . . .
Jumped right in the middle of the square 17.
She stood there for a long moment, eyes shut, seeing how it felt.
Then she ran upstairs and lay out on the bed and touched her mouth to
see if a summer afternoon was breathing out of it, and listening for
that drowsy hum, the golden sound, and it was there.
And it was this sound, eventually, which sang her to sleep.
THE FINNEGAN
To say that I have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair
Finnegan is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final
melancholy. Only now, at threescore and ten, can I write these words for
an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to
unearth my truths or bury my lies.
The facts are these:
Three children went astray and were missed. Their bodies were found in
the midst of Chatham Forest and each bore no marks of criminal
assassination, but all had suffered their lifeblood to be drained. Only
their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes
withered by sunlight and no rain.
From the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of
vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites. Such myths always
pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks. It could only have been a
tombyard beast, it was said, that fed on and destroyed three lives and
ruined three dozen more.
The children were buried in the most holy ground. Soon after, Sir Robert
Merriweather, pretender to the throne of Sherlock Holmes but modestly
refusing the claim, moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique
house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life. With
myself, I might add, to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of
underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest.
Sir Robert Merriweather, you say?
Just that. Plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his
shut-up house.
Were the doors used? Not one in nine. How had they appeared in Sir
Robert's old manse? He had shipped them in, as a collector of doors,
from Rio, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, and mid-America. Once collected, he had
stashed them, hinged, to be seen from both sides, on the walls of his
upper and lower chambers. There he conducted tours of these odd portals
for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously
overdone, the undersimplified, the rococo, or some First Empire cast
aside by Napoleon's nephews or seized from Hermann Goering, who had in
turn ransacked the Louvre. Others, pelted by Oklahoma dust storms, were
jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals
buried in the windblown desolations of 1936 America. Name your least
favorite door, it was his. Name the best quality, he owned it also,
hidden and safe, true beauties behind oblivion's portals.
I had come to see his doors, not the deaths. At his behest, which was a
command, I had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to
find Sir Robert involved not with ten dozen doors, but some
great dark door. A mysterious portal, still un-found. And beneath? A
tomb.
Sir Robert hurried the grand tour, opening and shutting panels rescued
from Peking, long buried near Etna, or filched from Nantucket. But his
heart, gone sick, was not in this, what should have been delightful,
tour.
He described the spring rains that drenched the country to make things
green, only to have people to walk out in that fine weather and one week
find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his
neck, and in the next weeks, the bodies of the two girls. People shouted
for the police and sat drinking in pubs, their faces long and pale,
while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the
dooms that lay in Chatham Forest.
"Will you come with me," said Sir Robert at last, "on a very strange,
sad picnic?"
"I will," I said.
So we snapped ourselves in weather-proofs, lugged a hamper of sandwiches
and red wine, and plunged into the forest on a drear Sunday.
There was time, as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the
trees, to recall what the papers had said about the vanished children's
bloodless flesh, the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times,
clueless, while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drum-tight
at sunset.
"Rain. Damn. Rain!" Sir Robert's pale face stared up, his gray mustache
quivering over his thin mouth. He was sick and brittle and old. "Our
picnic will be ruined!"
"Picnic?" I said. "Will our killer join us for eats?"
"I pray to God he will," Sir Robert said. "Yes, pray to God he will."
We walked through a land that was now mists, now dim sunlight, now
forest, now open glade, until we came into a silent part of the woods, a
silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the
green moss lay in swards and hillocks. Spring had not yet filled the
empty trees. The sun was like an arctic disk, withdrawn, cold, and
almost dead.
"This is the place," said Sir Robert at last.
"Where the children were found?" I inquired.
"Their bodies empty as empty can be."
I looked at the glade and thought of the children and the people who had
stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to
whisper and touch and go away, lost.
"The murderer was never apprehended?"
"Not this clever fellow. How observant are you?" asked Sir Robert.
"What do you want observed?"
"There's the catch. The police slipped up. They were stupidly
anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess, seeking a killer with two
arms, two legs, a suit of clothes, and a knife. So hypnotized with their
human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious
unbelievable fact about this place. So!"
He gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth.
Something happened. I stared at the ground. "Do that again," I
whispered.
"You saw it?"
"I thought I saw a small trapdoor open and shut. May I have your cane?"
He gave me the cane. I tapped the ground. It happened again.
"A spider!" I cried. "Gone! God, how quick!"
"Finnegan," Sir Robert muttered.
"What?"
"You know the old saying: in again, out again, Finnegan. Here."
With his penknife, Sir Robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of
earth, breaking off bits to show me the tunnel. The spider, in panic,
leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground.
Sir Robert handed me the tunnel. "Like gray velvet. Feel. A model
builder, that small chap. A tiny shelter, camouflaged, and him alert. He
could hear a fly walk. Then pounce out, seize, pop back, slam the lid!"
"I didn't know you loved Nature."
"Loathe it. But this wee chap, there's much we share. Doors. Hinges.
Wouldn't consider other arachnids. But my love of portals drew me to
study this incredible carpenter." Sir Robert worked the trap on its
cobweb hinges. "What craftsmanship! And it all ties to the tragedies!"
"The murdered children?"
Sir Robert nodded. "Notice any special thing about this forest?"
"It's too quiet."
"Quiet!" Sir Robert smiled weakly. "Vast quantities of silence. No
familiar birds, beetles, crickets, toads. Not a rustle or stir. The
police didn't notice. Why should they? But it was this absence of sound
and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders."
He toyed with the amazing structure in his hands.
"What would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough, in a
hideout big enough, so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound,
be seized, and vanish with a soft thud below. How say you?" Sir Robert
stared at the trees. "Poppycock and bilge? Yet, why not? Evolution,
selection, growth, mutations, and-pfft!"
Again he tapped with his cane. A trapdoor flew open, shut.
"Finnegan," he said.
The sky darkened.
"Rain!" Casting a cold gray eye at the clouds, he stretched his frail
hand to touch the showers. "Damn! Arachnids hate rain. And so will our
huge dark Finnegan."
"Finnegan!" I cried irritably.
"I believe in him, yes."
"A spider larger than a child?!"
"Twice as large."
The cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us. "Lord, I hate to leave.
Quick, before we go. Here."
Sir Robert raked away the old leaves with his cane, revealing two
globular gray-brown objects.
"What are they?" I bent. "Old cannonballs?"
"No." He cracked the grayish globes. "Soil, through and through."
I touched the crumbled bits.
"Our Finnegan excavates," said Sir Robert. "To make his tunnel. With his
large rakelike chelicerae he dislodges soil, works it into a ball,
carries it in his jaws, and drops it beyond his hole."
Sir Robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm. "Normal
balls evicted from a tiny trapdoor tunnel. Toy-size." He knocked his
cane on the huge globes at our feet. "Explain those!"
I laughed. "The children must've made them with mud!"
"Nonsense!" cried Sir Robert irritably, glaring about at trees and
earth. "By God, somewhere, our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid.
We might be standing on it. Christ, don't stare! His door has beveled
rims. Some architect, this Finnegan. A genius at camouflage."
Sir Robert raved on and on, describing the dark earth, the arachnid, its
fiddling legs, its hungry mouth, as the wind roared and the trees shook.
Suddenly, Sir Robert flung up his cane.
"No!" he cried.
I had no time to turn. My flesh froze, my heart stopped.
Something snatched my spine.
I thought I heard a huge bottle uncorked, a lid sprung. Then this
monstrous thing crawled down my back.
"Here!" cried Sir Robert. "Now!"
He struck with his cane. I fell, dead weight. He thrust the thing from
my spine. He lifted it.
The wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it onto my back.
Weakly, I tried to rise, shivering. "Silly," I said a dozen times.
"Silly. Damn awful silly!"
"Silly, no. Brandy, yes!" said Sir Robert. "Brandy?"
The sky was very black now. The rain swarmed over us.
Door after door after door, and at last into Sir Robert's country house
study. A warm, rich room, where a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth. We
devoured our sandwiches, waiting for the rain to cease. Sir Robert
estimated that it would stop by eight o'clock, when, by moonlight, we
might return, ever so reluctantly, to Chatham Forest. I remembered the
fallen branch, its spidering touch, and drank both wine and brandy.
"The silence in the forest," said Sir Robert, finishing his meal. "What
murderer could achieve such a silence?"
"An insanely clever man with a series of baited, poisoned traps, with
liberal quantities of insecticide, might kill off every bird, every
rabbit, every insect," I said.
"Why should he do that?"
"To convince us that there is a large spider nearby. To perfect his
act."
"We are the only ones who have noticed this silence; the police did not.
Why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing?"
"Why is a murderer? you might well ask."
"I am not convinced." Sir Robert topped his food with wine. "This
creature, with a voracious mouth, has cleansed the forest. With nothing
left, he seized the children. The silence, the murders, the prevalence
of trapdoor spiders, the large earth balls, it all fits."
Sir Robert's fingers crawled about the desktop, quite like a washed,
manicured spider in itself. He made a cup of his frail hands, held them
up.
"At the bottom of a spider's burrow is a dustbin into which drop insect
remnants on which the spider has dined. Imagine the dustbin of our Grand
Finnegan!"
I imagined. I visioned a Great Legged thing fastened to its dark lid
under the forest and a child running, singing in the half-light. A brisk
insucked whisk of air, the song cut short, then nothing but an empty
glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid, and beneath the dark earth
the spider, fiddling, cabling, spinning the stunned child in its
silently orchestrating legs.
What would the dustbin of such an incredible spider resemble? What the
remnants of many banquets? I shuddered.
"Rain's letting up." Sir Robert nodded his approval. "Back to the
forest. I've mapped the damned place for weeks. All the bodies were
found in one half-open glade. That's where the assassin, if it was a
man, arrives! Or where the unnatural silk-spinning, earth-tunneling
architect of special doors abides his tomb.”
"Must I hear all this?" I protested.
"Listen more." Sir Robert downed the last of his burgundy. "The poor
children's prolapsed corpses were found at thirteen-day intervals. Which
means that every two weeks our loathsome eight-legged hide-and-seeker
must feed. Tonight is the fourteenth night after the last child was
found, nothing but skin. Tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh.
So! Within the hour, I shall introduce you to Finnegan the great and
horrible!"
"All of which," I said, "makes me want to drink."
"Here I go." Sir Robert stepped through one of his Louis the Fourteenth
portals. "To find the last and final and most awful door in all my life.
You will follow."
Damn, yes! I followed.
The sun had set, the rain was gone, and the clouds cleared off to show a
cold and troubled moon. We moved in our own silence and the silence of
the exhausted paths and glades while Sir Robert handed me a small silver
pistol.
"Not that that would help. Killing an outsize arachnid is sticky. Hard
to know where to fire the first shot. If you miss, there'll be no time
for a second. Damned things, large or small, move in the instant!"
"Thanks." I took the weapon. "I need a drink."
"Done." Sir Robert handed me a silver brandy flask. "Drink as needed."
I drank. "What about you?"
"I have my own special flask." Sir Robert lifted it. "For the right
time."
"Why wait?"
"I must surprise the beast and mustn't be drunk at the encounter. Four
seconds before the thing grabs me, I will imbibe of this dear Napoleon
stuff, spiced with a rude surprise.
"Surprise?"
"Ah, wait. You'll see. So will this dark thief of life. Now, dear sir,
here we part company. I this way, you yonder. Do you mind?"
"Mind when I'm scared gutless? What's that?"
"Here. If I should vanish." He handed me a sealed letter. "Read it aloud
to the constabulary. It will help them locate me and Finnegan, lost and
found."
"Please, no details. I feel like a damned fool following you while
Finnegan, if he exists, is underfoot snug and warm, saying, 'Ah, those
idiots above running about, freezing. I think I'll let them freeze.’ ”
"One hopes not. Get away now. If we walk together, he won't jump up.
Alone, he'll peer out the merest crack, glom the scene with a huge
bright eye, flip down again, ssst, and one of us gone to darkness."
"Not me, please. Not me."
We walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in
the half moonlight.
"Are you there?" called Sir Robert from half the world away in leafy
dark.
"I wish I weren't," I yelled back.
"Onward!" cried Sir Robert. "Don't lose sight of me. Move closer. We're
near on the site. I can intuit, I almost feel-"
As a final cloud shifted, moonlight glowed brilliantly to show Sir
Robert waving his arms about like antennae, eyes half shut, gasping with
expectation.
"Closer, closer," I heard him exhale. "Near on. Be still. Perhaps . .
He froze in place. There' was something in his aspect that made me want
to leap, race, and yank him off the turf he had chosen.
"Sir Robert, oh, God!" I cried. "Run!"
He froze. One hand and arm orchestrated the air, feeling, probing, while
his other hand delved, brought forth his silver-coated flask of brandy.
He held it high in the moonlight, a toast to doom. Then, afflicted with
need, he took one, two, three, my God, fourincredible swigs!
Arms out, balancing the wind, tilting his head back, laughing like a
boy, he swigged the last of his mysterious drink.
"All right, Finnegan, below and beneath!" he cried. "Come get me!"
He stomped his foot.
Cried out victorious.
And vanished.
It was all over in a second.
A flicker, a blur, a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a
whisper, a suction, and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut.
The glade was empty.
"Sir Robert. Quick!"
But there was no one to quicken.
Not thinking that I might be snatched and vanished, I lurched to the
spot where Sir Robert had drunk his wild toast.
I stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart
beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles, dry grass,
and earth.
I must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog, then fell
to my knees, fearless, to dig for lids, for tunneled tombs where a
voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves, binding and mummifying a thing
that had been my friend. This is his final door, I thought insanely,
crying the name of my friend.
I found only his pipe, cane, and empty brandy flask, flung down when he
had escaped night, life, everything.
Swaying up, I fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering
earth, a dumb thing gone stupid as I finished and staggered over his
instant graveyard, his locked-in tomb, listening for muffled screams,
shrieks, cries, but heard none. I ran in circles, with no ammunition
save my weeping shouts. I would have stayed all night, but a downpour of
leaves, a great spidering flourish of broken branches, fell to panic and
suffer my heart. I fled, still calling his name to a silence lidded by
clouds that hid the moon.
At his estate, I beat on the door, wailing, yanking, until I recalled:
it opened inward, it was unlocked.
Alone in the library, with only liquor to help me live, I read the
letter that Sir Robert had left behind:
My dear Douglas:
I am old and have seen much but am not mad. Finnegan exists. My chemist
had provided me with a sure poison that I will mix in my brandy for our
walk. I will drink all. Finnegan, not knowing me as a poisoned morsel
will give me a swift invite. Now you see me, now you don't. I will then
be the weapon of his death, minutes after my own. I do not think there
is another outsize nightmare like him on earth. Once gone, that's the
end.
Being old, I am immensely curious. I fear not death, for my physicians
tell me that f no accidents kill me, cancer will.
I thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin. But
then I'd never know where he was or if he really existed. Finnegan would
die unseen in his monstrous closet, and I never the wiser. This way, for
one victorious moment, I will know. Fear for me. Envy me. Pray for me.
Sorry to abandon you without farewells. Dear friend, carry on.
I folded the letter and wept.
No more was ever heard of him.
Some say Sir Robert killed himself, an actor in his own melodrama, and
that one day we shall unearth his brooding, lost, and Gothic body and
that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with
doors and hinges, and more doors, led him, crazed, to study this one
species of spider, and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in
history, an insane burrow into which he popped to die, before my eyes,
thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible Finnegan.
But I have found no burrow. I do not believe a man could construct such
a pit, even given Sir Robert's overwhelming passion for doors.
I can only ask, would a man murder, draw his victims' blood, build an
earthen vault? For what motive? Create the finest secret exit in all
time? Madness. And what of those large grayish balls of earth supposedly
tossed forth from the spider's lair?
Somewhere, Finnegan and Sir Robert lie clasped in a velvet-lined
unmarked crypt, deep under. Whether one is the paranoiac alter ego of
the other, I cannot say. But the murders have ceased, the rabbits once
more rush in Chatham Forest, and its bushes teem with butterflies and
birds. It is another spring, and the children run again through a loud
glade, no longer silent.
Finnegan and Sir Robert, requiescat in peace.
 THAT WOMAN ON THE LAWN
Very late at night he heard the weeping on the lawn in front of his
house. It was the sound of a woman crying. By its sound he knew it was
not a girl or a mature woman, but the crying of someone eighteen or
nineteen years old. It went on, then faded and stopped, and again
started up, now moving this way or that on the late-summer wind.
He lay in bed listening to it until it made his eyes fill with tears. He
turned over, shut his eyes, let the tears fall, but could not stop the
sound. Why should a young woman be weeping long after midnight out
there?
He sat up and the weeping stopped.
At the window, he looked down. The lawn was empty but covered with dew.
There was a trail of footsteps across the lawn to the middle where
someone had stood turning, and another trail going off toward the garden
around the house.
The moon stood full in the sky and filled the lawn with its light, but
there was no more sadness and only the footprints there.
He stepped back from the window, suddenly chilled, and went down to heat
and drink a cup of chocolate.
He did not think of the weeping again until dusk the next day, and even
then thought that it must be some woman from a house nearby, unhappy
with life, perhaps locked out and in need of a place to let her sadness
go.
Yet . . .?
As the twilight deepened, coming home he found himself hurrying from the
bus, at a steady pace which astonished him. Why, why all this?
Idiot, he thought. A woman unseen weeps under your window, and here at
sunset the next day, you almost run.
Yes, he thought, but her voice!
Was it beautiful, then?
No. Only familiar.
Where had he heard such a voice before, wordless in crying?
Who could he ask, living in an empty house from which his parents had
vanished long ago?
He turned in at his front lawn and stood still, his eyes shadowed.
What had he expected? That whoever she was would be waiting here? Was he
that lonely that a single voice long after midnight roused all his
senses?
No. Simply put: he must know who the crying woman was.
And he was certain she would return tonight as he slept.
He went to bed at eleven, and awoke at three, panicked that he had
missed a miracle. Lightning had destroyed a nearby town or an earthquake
had shaken half the world to dust, and he had slept through it!
Fool! he thought, and slung back the covers and moved to the window, to
see that indeed he had overslept.
For there on the lawn were the delicate footprints.
And he hadn't even heard the weeping!
He would have gone out to kneel in the grass, but at that moment a
police car motored slowly by, looking at nothing and the night.
How could he run to prowl, to probe, to touch the grass if that car came
by again? What doing? Picking clover blossoms? Weeding dandelions? What,
what?
His bones cracked with indecision. He would go down, he would not.
Already the memory of that terrible weeping faded the more he tried to
make it clear. If he missed her one more night, the memory itself might
be gone.
Behind him, in his room, the alarm clock rang. Damn! he thought. What
time did I set it for? He shut off the alarm and sat on his bed, rocking
gently, waiting, eyes shut, listening.
The wind shifted. The tree just outside the window whispered and
stirred.
He opened his eyes and leaned forward. From far off, coming near, and
now down below, the quiet sound of a woman weeping.
She had come back to his lawn and was not forever lost. Be very quiet,
he thought.
And the sounds she made came up on the wind through the blowing curtains
into his room.
Careful now. Careful but quick.
He moved to the window and looked down.
In the middle of the lawn she stood and wept, her hair long and dark on
her shoulders, her face bright with tears.
And there was something in the way her hands trembled at her sides, the
way her hair moved quietly in the wind, that shook him so that he almost
fell.
He knew her and yet did not. He had seen her before, but had never seen.
Turn your head, he thought.
Almost as if hearing this, the young woman sank to her knees to half
kneel on the grass, letting the wind comb her hair, head down and
weeping so steadily and bitterly that he wanted to cry out: Oh, no! It
kills my heart!
And as if she had heard, quite suddenly her head lifted, her weeping
grew less as she looked up at the moon, so that he saw her face.
And it was indeed a face seen somewhere once, but where?
A tear fell. She blinked.
It was like the blinking of a camera and a picture taken.
"God save me!" he whispered. "No!"
He whirled and stumbled toward the closet to seize down an avalanche of
boxes and albums. In the dark he scrabbled, then pulled on the closet
light, tossed aside six albums until finally, dragging another forth and
riffling pages, he gave a cry, stopped, and held a photo close, then
turned and moved blindly to the window.
There he stared down at the lawn and then at the photograph, very old,
very yellowed with age.
Yes, yes, the same! The image struck his eyes and then his heart. His
whole body shook, made an immense pulsation, as he leaned at the album,
leaned on the window frame, and almost shouted:
You! How dare you come back! How dare you be young! How dare you
be what? A girl untouched, wandering late on my lawn!? You
were never that young! Never! Damn, oh, damn your warm blood, damn your
wild soul!
But this he did not shout or say.
For something in his eyes, like a beacon, must have flashed.
The crying of the young woman on the lawn stopped.
She looked up.
At which instant the album fell from his fingers, through the burst-wide
screen, and down like a dark bird fluttering to strike the earth.
The young man gave a muted cry, whirled, and ran. "No, no!" he cried
aloud. "I didn't mean-come back!" He was down the stairs and out on the
porch in a matter of seconds. The door slammed behind him like a
gunshot. The explosion nailed him to the rail, half down to the lawn,
where there was nothing to be seen but footprints. Either way, up the
street lay empty sidewalks and shadows under trees. A radio played off
in an upstairs window in a house behind trees. A car passed, murmuring,
at a far intersection.
"Wait," he whispered. "Come back. I shouldn't have said-"
He stopped. He had said nothing, but only thought it. But his outrage,
his jealousy?
She had felt that. She had somehow heard. And now. ..?
She'll never come back, he thought. Oh God!
He sat on the porch steps for a while, quietly biting his knuckle.
At three in the morning, in bed, he thought he heard a sigh and soft
footsteps in grass, and waited. The photo album lay closed on the floor.
Even though it lay shut, he could see and know her face. And it was
utterly impossible, utterly insane.
His last thought before sleep was: ghost.
The strangest ghost that ever walked.
The ghost of someone dead.
The ghost of someone who died very old.
But somehow come back not as her old self.
But a ghost that was somehow young.
Weren't ghosts always, when they returned, the same age as when they
died?
No.
Not this one anyway.
"Why . ..?" he whispered.
And dream took over the whisper.
One night passed and then another and another, and there was nothing on
the lawn but the light of a moon that changed its face from outright
stare to half grimace.
He waited.
The first night a more than ordinarily casual cat crossed the yard at
two a.m.
The second night a dog trotted by, wearing his tongue half out of his
mouth like a loosely tied red cravat, smiling at trees.
The third night a spider spent from twelve-twenty-five until four a.m.
building a baroque clockface on the air between lawn and trees, which a
bird broke in passing at dawn.
He slept most of Sunday and awoke with a fever that was not an illness
at dusk.
Late in the twilight of the fifth day, the color of the sky somehow
promised her return, as did the way the wind leaned against the trees
and the look of the moon when it finally rose to set the scene.
"All right," he said, half aloud. "Now." But at midnight, nothing.
"Come on," he whispered.
One o'clock, nothing.
You must, he thought.
No, you will.
He slept for ten minutes and woke suddenly at two-ten, knowing that when
he went to the window-
She would be there.
She was.
At first, he didn't see her, and groaned, and then, in the shadow of the
great oak far out on the edge of the lawn, he saw something move, and
one foot came out, and she took a step and stood very still.
He held his breath, quieted his heart, told himself to turn, walk, and
take each step down with precision, numbering them, fifteen, fourteen,
thirteen, moving in darkness with no rush, six, five, four, and at last
one. He opened the front screen door with only a whisper, and was on the
porch without frightening what might be out beyond waiting for him.
Quietly, he moved down the porch steps to the edge of the lawn, like one
who stands on the rim of a pond. Out in the center of that pond, the
young woman stood, trapped like someone on thin ice that might at any
moment break and drop her through.
She did not see him. And then ...
She did a thing that was a signal. Tonight her hair was fixed in a knot
at the back of her head. She lifted her white arms in a gesture and with
one touch of her fingers, a touch of snow, loosened her hair.
It fell in a dark banner, to blow and repattern itself across her
shoulders, which trembled with their shadows.
The wind stirred her hair in the night and moved it about her face and
on her uplifted hands.
The shadows laid down by the moon under every tree leaned as if called
by the motion.
The entire world shifted in its sleep.
The wind blew as the young woman waited.
But no footsteps sounded along the white sidewalks. No front doors
opened far down the street. No windows were raised. No motion caused
front porches to creak and shift.
He took another step out onto the small meadow of night.
"Who are you-?" she gasped, and stepped back. "No, no," he said softly.
"It's all right." Another trembling had taken over her body. Where
before it had been some hope, some anticipation, now it was fear. One
hand stopped her hair from blowing; the other half shielded her face.
''I'll stand right here,'' he said. ''Believe me.'' She waited a long
while, staring at him until her shoulders
relaxed and the lines around her mouth vanished. Her whole body sensed
the truth of his words.
"I don't understand," she said.
"I don't either." "What are you doing here?"
"I don't know." "What am I doing here?"
"You came to meet someone," he said.
"Did I?"
The town clock struck three in the morning far away. She listened to it,
her face shadowed by the sound.
"But it's so late. People don't walk around late on front lawns!"
"They do if they must," he said.
"But why?"
"Maybe we can find out, if we talk."
"About what, what?!"
"About why you're here. If we talk long enough, we may know. I know why
I'm here, of course. I heard you crying."
"Oh, I'm so ashamed."
"Don't be. Why are people ashamed of tears? I cry often. Then I start
laughing. But the crying must come first. Go ahead."
"What a strange man you are."
Her hand fell away from her hair. Her other hand moved away so her face
was illuminated by a small and growing curiosity.
"I thought I was the only one who knew about crying," she said.
"Everyone thinks that. It's one of those little secrets we keep from
each other. Show me a serious man and I'll show you a man who has never
wept. Show me a madman and I'll show you a man who dried his tears a
long time ago. Go ahead."
"I think I'm done," she said.
"Any time, start over."
She burst out a tiny laugh. "Oh, you are strange. Who are you?"
"We'll come to that."
She peered across the lawn at his hands, his face, his mouth, and then
at his eyes.
"Oh, I know you. But from where?!"
"That would spoil it. You wouldn't believe, anyway."
"I would!"
Now it was his turn to laugh quietly. "You're very young."
"No, nineteen! Ancient!"
"Girls, by the time they go from twelve to nineteen, are full of years,
yes. I don't know; but it must be so. Now, please, why are you out here
in the middle of the night?"
"I-" She shut her eyes to think in on it. "I'm waiting."
"Yes?"
"And I'm sad."
"It's the waiting that makes you sad, yes?"
"I think, no, yes, no."
"And you don't quite know what you're waiting for?"
"Oh, I wish I could be sure. All of me's waiting. I don't know, all of
me. I don't understand. I'm impossible!"
"No, you're everyone that ever grew up too fast and wanted too much. I
think girls, women, like you have slipped out at night since time began.
If it wasn't here in Green Town, it was in Cairo or Alexandria or Rome
or Paris in summer, anywhere there was a private place and late hours
and no one to see, so they just rose up and out, as if someone had
called their name-"
"I was called, yes! That's it! Someone did call my name! It's true. How
did you know? Was it you!"
"No. But someone we both know. You'll know his name when you go back to
bed tonight, wherever that is."
"Why, in that house, behind you," she said. "That's my house. I was born
in it."
"Well"-he laughed-"so was I."
"You? How can that be? Are you sure?"
"Yes. Anyway, you heard someone calling. You had to come out-"
"I did. Many nights now. But, always, no one's here. They must be there,
or why would I hear them?"
"One day there'll be someone to fit the voice."
"Oh, don't joke with me!"
"I'm not. Believe. There will be. That's what all those other women
heard in other years and places, middle of summer, dead of winter, go
out and risk cold, stand warm in snow banks, and listen and look for
strange footprints on the midnight snow, and only an old dog trotting
by, all smiles. Damn, damn."
"Oh, yes, damn, damn." And her smile showed for a moment, even as the
moon came out of the clouds and went away. "Isn't it silly?"
"No. Men do the same. They take long walks when they're sixteen,
seventeen. They don't stand on lawns, waiting, no. But, my God, how
they walk! Miles and miles from midnight until dawn and come home
exhausted and explode and die in bed."
"What a shame that those who stand and wait and those who walk all night
can't-"
"Meet?"
"Yes; don't you think it's a shame?"
"They do, finally."
"Oh, no, I shall never meet anyone. I'm old and ugly and terrible and I
don't know how many nights I've heard that voice making me come here and
there's nothing and I just want to die."
"Oh, lovely young girl," he said gently. "Don't die. The cavalry is on
its way. You will be saved."
There was such certainty in his voice that it made her glance up again,
for she had been looking at her hands and her own soul in her hands.
"You know, don't you?" she asked.
"Yes."
"You truly know? You tell the truth?"
"Swear to God, swear by all that's living."
"Tell me more!"
"There's little more to tell."
"Tell me!"
"Everything will be all right with you. Some night soon, or some day,
someone will call and they'll really be there when you come to find. The
game will be over."
"Hide-and-seek, you mean? But it's gone on too long!"
"It's almost over, Marie."
"You know my name!"
He stopped, confused. He had not meant to speak it.
"How did you know, who are you?" she demanded.
"When you get back to sleep tonight, you'll know. If we say too much,
you'll disappear, or I'll disappear. I'm not quite sure which of us is
real or which is a ghost."
"Not me! Oh, surely not me. I can feel myself. I'm here. Why, look!" And
she showed him the remainder of her tears brushed from her eyelids and
held on her palms.
"Oh, that's real, all right. Well, then, dear young woman, I must be the
visitor. I come to tell you it will all go right. Do you believe in
special ghosts?"
"Are you special?"
"One of us is. Or maybe both. The ghost of young love or the ghost of
the unborn."
"Is that what I am, you are?"
"Paradoxes aren't easy to explain."
"Then, depending on how you look at it, you're impossible, and so am I."
"If it makes it easier, just think I'm not really here. Do you believe
in ghosts?"
"I think I do."
"It comes to me to imagine, then, that there are special ghosts in the
world. Not ghosts of dead people. But ghosts of want and need, or I
guess you might say desire."
"I don't understand."
"Well, have you ever lain in bed late afternoons, late nights and
dreamed something so much, awake, you felt your soul jump out of your
body as if something had yanked a long, pure white sheet straight out
the window? You want something so much, your soul leaps out and follows,
my God, fast?"
"Why . . . yes. Yes!"
"Boys do that, men do that. When I was twelve I read Burroughs' Mars
novels. John Carter used to stand under the stars, hold up his arms to
Mars, and ask to be taken.
And Mars grabbed his soul, yanked him like an aching tooth across space,
and landed him in dead Martian seas. That's boys, that's men."
"And girls, women?"
"They dream, yes. And their ghosts come out of their bodies. Living
ghosts. Living wants. Living needs."
"And go to stand on lawns in the middle of winter nights?"
"That's about it."
"Am I a ghost, then?"
"Yes, the ghost of wanting so much it kills but doesn't kill you, shakes
and almost breaks you."
"And you?"
"I must be the answer-ghost."
"The answer-ghost. What a funny name!"
"Yes. But you've asked and I know the answer."
"Tell me!"
"All right, the answer is this, young girl, young woman. The time of
waiting is almost over. Your time of despair will soon be through. Very
soon, now, a voice will call and when you come out, both of you, your
ghost of want and your body with it, there will be a man to go with the
voice that calls."
"Oh, please don't tell me that if it isn't true!" Her voice trembled.
Tears flashed again in her eyes. She half raised her arms again in
defense.
"I wouldn't dream to hurt you. I only came to tell." The town clock
struck again in the deep morning. "It's late," she said.
"Very late. Get along, now." "Is that all you're going to say?" "You
don't need to know any more." The last echoes of the great clock faded.
"How strange," she murmured. "The ghost of a question, the ghost of an
answer."
"What better ghosts can there be?"
"None that I ever heard of. We're twins."
"Far nearer than you think."
She took a step, looked down, and gasped with delight. "Look, oh, look.
I can move!"
"Yes."
"What was it you said, boys walk all night, miles and miles?"
"Yes."
"I could go back in, but I can't sleep now. I must walk, too."
"Do that," he said gently.
"But where shall I go?"
"Why," he said, and he suddenly knew. He knew where to send her and was
suddenly angry with himself for knowing, angry with her for asking. A
burst of jealousy welled in him. He wanted to race down the street to a
certain house where a certain young man lived in another year and break
the window, burn the roof. And yet, oh, yet, if he did that!?
"Yes?" she said, for he had kept her waiting.
Now, he thought, you must tell her. There's no escape.
For if you don't tell her, angry fool, you yourself will never be born.
A wild laugh burst from his mouth, a laugh that accepted the entire
night and time and all his crazed thinking.
"So you want to know where to go?" he said at last.
    "Oh, yes!"
He nodded his head. "Up to that corner, four blocks to the right, one
block to the left."
She repeated it quickly. "And the final number?!"
"Eleven Green Park."
"Oh, thank you, thank you!" She ran a few steps, then stopped,
bewildered. Her hands were helpless at her throat. Her mouth trembled.
"Silly. I hate to leave."
"Why?"
"Why, because . . . I'm afraid I'll never see you again!"
"You will. Three years from now."
"Are you sure?"
"I won't look quite the same. But it'll be me. And you'll know me
forever."
"Oh, I'm glad for that. Your face is familiar. I somehow know you well."
She began to walk slowly, looking over at him as he stood near the porch
of the house.
"Thanks," she said. "You've saved my life."
"And my own along with it."
The shadows of a tree fell across her face, touched her cheeks, moved in
her eyes.
"Oh, Lord! Girls lie in bed nights listing the names for their future
children. Silly. Joe. John. Christopher. Samuel. Stephen. And right now,
Will." She touched the gentle rise of her stomach, then lifted her hand
out halfway to point to him in the night. "Is your name Will?"
"Yes."
Tears absolutely burst from her eyes. He wept with her.
"Oh, that's fine, fine," she said at last. "I can go now. I won't be out
here on the lawn anymore. Thank God, thank you. Good night."
She went away into the shadows across the lawn and along the sidewalk
down the street. At the far corner he saw her turn and wave and walk
away.
"Good night," he said quietly.
I am not born yet, he thought, or she has been dead many years, which is
it? which?
The moon sailed into clouds.
The motion touched him to step, walk, go up the porch stairs, wait, look
out at the lawn, go inside, shut the door.
A wind shook the trees.
The moon came out again and looked upon a lawn where two sets of
footprints, one going one way, one going another in the dew, slowly,
slowly, as the night continued, vanished.
By the time the moon had gone down the sky there was only an empty lawn
and no sign, and much dew.
The great town clock struck six in the morning. Fire showed in the east.
A cock crowed.
THE VERY GENTLE MURDERS
Joshua Enderby awoke in the middle of the night because e felt someone's
fingers at his throat.
In the rich darkness above him he sensed but could not see his wife's
frail, skelatinous weight seated on his chest while she dabbled and
clenched tremblingly again and again at his neck.
He opened his eyes wide. He realized what she was trying to do. It was
so ridiculous he almost cried out with laughter!
His rickety, jaundiced, eighty-five-year-old wife was trying to strangle
him!
She panted forth a rum-and-bitters smell as she perched there, toppling
like a drunken moth, tinkering away as if he were a toy. She sighed
irritably and her skinny fingers began to swear as she gasped,
"Why don't you, oh, why don 't you?"
Why don't I what? he wondered idly, lying there. He swallowed and this
faint action of his Adam's apple dislodged her feeble clutch. Why don't
I die; is that it? he cried silently. He lay another few moments,
wondering if she'd gain strength enough to do him in. She didn't.
Should he snap on the light to confront her? Wouldn't she look a silly
ass, a skinny chicken aloft sidesaddle on her hated husband's amazed
body, and him laughing?
Joshua Enderby groaned and yawned. "Missy?"
Her hands froze on his collarbone.
"Will you-" He turned, pretending half sleep. "Will you-please' '-he
yawned-' 'move to your side - of the bed? Eh? Good girl."
Missy moved off in the dark. He heard ice tinkle. She was having another
shot of rum.
At noon the next day, enjoying the weather and waiting for luncheon
guests to arrive, old Joshua and Missy traded drinks in the garden
pavilion. He handed her Dubonnet; she gave him sherry.
There was a moment of silence as both eyed the stuff and hesitated to
sip. He handled his glass in such a way that his large white diamond
ring sparked and glittered on his palsied hand. Its light made him
flinch and at last he gathered his phlegm.
"Missy," he said. "You haven't long to live, you know." Missy was hidden
behind jonquils in a crystal bowl and now peered out at her mummified
husband. Both perceived that the other's hands shook. She wore a cobalt
dress, heavily iced with luncheon jewels, little glittery planets under
each ear, a scarlet design for a mouth. The ancient whore of Babylon, he
thought dryly.
"How odd, my dear, how very odd," Missy said with a polite scrape of her
voice. “Why, only last night-"
"You were thinking of me?"
"We must talk."
"Yes, we must." He leaned like a wax mannequin in his chair. "No rush.
But if I do you in, or if you do me in (it matters not which), let's
protect each other, yes? Oh, don't look at me in amaze, my dear. I was
perfectly aware of your little gallup last night on my ribs, fumbling
with my esophagus, feeling the tumblers click, or whatever."
"Dear me." Blood rose in Missy's powdery cheeks. "Were you awake all
during? I'm mortified. I think I shall have to go lie down."
"Nonsense." Joshua stopped her. "If I die, you should be shielded so no
one'll accuse you. Same with me, if you die. Why go to all the trouble
of trying to-eliminate-each other if it just means a gallows-drop or a
french fry."
"Logical enough," she agreed.
"I suggest a-a series of mash notes to each other. Umm, lavish displays
of sentiment before friends, gifts, et cetera. I'll run up bills for
flowers, diamond bracelets. You purchase fine leather wallets and
gold-ferruled canes for me."
"You have a head for things, I must say," she admitted.
"It will help allay suspicion if we appear madly, anciently in love."
"You know," she said tiredly, "it doesn't matter, Joshua, which of us
dies first, except that I'm very old and would like to do one thing
right in my life. I've always been such a dilettante. I've never liked
you. Loved you, yes, but that's ten million years back. You never were a
friend. If it weren't for the children-"
"Motives are bilge," he said. "We are two querulous old pots with
nothing to do but kick off, and make a circus of that. But how much
better the dying game if we write a few rules, act it neatly, with no
one the wiser. How long has this assassination plot of yours been
active?"
She beamed. "Remember the opera last week? You slipped from the curb?
That car almost nailed you?"
"Good Lord." He laughed. "I thought someone shoved both of us!" He
leaned forward, chuckling. "Okay. When you fell in the bath last
month? I greased the tub!"
Unthinkingly, she gasped, drank part of her Dubonnet, then froze.
Reading her mind, he stared at his own drink.
"This isn't poisoned, by any chance?" He sniffed his glass. "Don't be
silly," she replied, touching her Dubonnet with a lizard's doubtful
tongue. "They'd find the residue in what's left of your stomach. Just be
sure you double-check your shower tonight. I have kited the temperature,
which might bring on a seizure."
"You didn't!" he scoffed.
"I've thought about it," she confessed.
The front-door chimes rang, but not with their usual joy, sounding more
funereal. Nonsense! Joshua thought. Bosh! thought Missy, then
brightened:
"We have forgotten our luncheon guest! That's the Gowrys! He's a bore,
but be nice! Fix your collar."
"It's damned tight. Too much starch. One more plot to strangle me?"
"I wish I had thought of that. Double time, now!"
And they marched, arm in arm, with idiot laughter, off to meet the
half-forgotten Gowrys.
Cocktails were served. The old relics sat side by side, hands laced like
school chums, laughing with weak heartiness at Gowry's dire jokes. They
leaned forward to show him their porcelain smiles, saying, "Oh, that's
a good one!" loudly, and, softly, sotto voce; to each other: "Thought of
anything new?" "Electric razor in your bath?" "Not bad, not bad!"
"And then Pat said to Mike!" cried Mr. Gowry.
From the corner of his mouth Joshua whispered to Missy, "You know, I
dislike you with something approaching the colossal proportions of first
love. You have taught me mayhem. How?"
"When the teacher is ready, the pupil will arrive," whispered Missy.
Laughter rose in tumbling, whirling waves. The room was giddy, airy,
light. "So Pat says to Mike, do it yourself!" boomed Gowry.
"Oh, ho!" everyone exploded.
"Now, dear." Missy waved at her ancient husband. "Tell one
of your jokes. Oh, but first," she remembered cleverly, "trot
down-cellar, darling, and fetch the brandy."
Gowry sprang forward with wild courtesy. "I know where it is!"
"Oh, Mr. Gowry, don't!"
Missy gestured frantically.
Mr. Gowry ran from the room.
"Oh, dear, dear me," cried Missy.
A moment later, Gowry uttered a loud shriek from the basement, followed
by a thunderous crash.
Missy hippety-hopped out, only to reappear moments later, her hand
clutched to her throat. "Heavens to Betsy," she wailed. "Come look.
I do believe Mr. Gowry has pitched himself straight down the cellar
stairs!"
The next morning Joshua Enderby shuffled into the house lugging a large
green velvet board some five feet by three, on which pistols were
clasped in display.
"Here I am!" he shouted.
Missy appeared with a rum Collins in one bracelet-jangly hand, her cane
thumping in the other. "What's that?" she demanded.
"First, how's old Gowry?"
"Broken leg. Wished it had been his vocal cords."
"Shame about that top cellar step gone loose, eh?" The old man hooked
the green velvet board to the wall. "Good thing Gowry lurched for the
brandy, not I."
"Shame." The wife drank thirstily. "Explain."
"I'm in the antique-gun-collecting business." He waved at the weapons in
their neat leather nests.
"I don't see-"
"With a collection of guns to clean-bang!" He beamed. "Man shoots wife
while oiling matchlock garter pistol. Didn't know it was loaded, says
weeping spouse."
"Touche'," she said.
An hour later, while oiling a revolver, he almost blew his brains out.
His wife came thumping in and froze. "Hell. You're still alive."
"Loaded, by God!" He lifted the weapon in a trembling hand. "None
were loaded! Unless-"
"Unless-?"
He seized three more weapons. "All loaded! You!"
"Me," she said. "While you ate lunch. I suppose I'll have to give you
tea now. Come along."
He stared at the bullet hole in the wall. "Tea, hell," he said. "Where's
the gin?!"
It was her turn for a shopping spree. "There are ants in the house." She
rattled her full shopping bag and set out ant-paste pots in all the
rooms, sprinkled ant powders on windowsills, in his golf bag, and over
his gun collection. From other sacks she drew rat poisons,
mouse-killers, and bug-exterminators. "A bad summer for roaches." She
distributed these liberally among the foods.
"That's a double-edged sword," he observed. "You'll fall on it!"
"Bilge. The victim mustn't choose his demise."
"Yes, but no violence. I wish a serene face for the coroner."
"Vanity. Dear Josh, your face will twist like a corkscrew with one
heaping teaspoon of Black Leaf Forty in your midnight cocoa!"
"I," he shot back, "know a recipe that will break you out in a thousand
lumps before expiring"
She quieted. "Why, Josh, I wouldn't dream of using Black Leaf Forty."
He bowed. "I wouldn't dream of using the thousand-lump recipe."
"Shake," she said.
Their assassins game continued. He bought huge rattraps to hide in the
halls. "You run barefoot so: small wounds, large infections!"
She in turn stuck the sofas full of antimacassar pins. Wherever he laid
a hand it drew blood. "Ow! Damn!" He sucked his fingers. "Are these
Amazon Indian blowgun darts?"
"No. Just plain old rusty lockjaw needles."
"Oh," he said.
Though he was aging fast, Joshua Enderby dearly loved to drive. You
could see him motoring with feeble wildness up and down the hills of
Beverly, mouth gaped, eyes blinking palely.
One afternoon he phoned from Malibu. "Missy? My God, I almost dove from
a cliff. My right front wheel flew off on a straightaway!"
"I planned it for a curve!"
"Sorry."
"Got the idea from Action News. Loosen car's wheel lugs:
tomato surprise."
"Never mind about careless old me," he said. "What's new with you?"
"Rug slipped on the hall stairs. Maid fell on her prat."
"Poor Lila."
"I send her everywhere ahead now. She bucketed down like a laundry bag.
Lucky she's all fat."
"We'll kill that one between us if we're not careful."
"Do you think? Oh, I do like Lila so."
"Lay Lila off for a spell. Hire someone new. If we catch them in our
crossfire, won't be so sad. Hate to think of Lila smashed under a
chandelier or-"
"Chandelier!" Missy shrieked. "You been fiddling with my grandma's
Fountainbleu Palace crystal hangings? Listen here, mister. You're not
to touch that chandelier!"
"Promise," he muttered.
"Good grief! Those lovely crystals! If they fell and missed me, I'd hop
on one leg to cane you to death, then wake you up and cane you again!"
Slam went the phone.
Joshua Enderby stepped in from the balcony at supper that night. He'd
been smoking. He looked at the table. "Where's your strawberry crumpet?"
"I wasn't hungry. I gave it to the new maid."
"Idiot!"
She glared. "Don't tell me you poisoned that crumpet, you old S.O.B.?"
There was a crash from the kitchen.
Joshua went to look and returned. "She's not new any-more," he said.
They stashed the new maid in an attic trunk. No one telephoned to ask
for her.
"Disappointing," observed Missy on the seventh day. "I felt certain
there'd be a tall, cold man with a notebook and another with a camera
and flashbulbs flashing. Poor girl was lonelier than we guessed."
Cocktail parties streamed wildly through the house. It was Missy's idea.
"So we can pick each other off in a forest of obstacles; moving
targets!"
Mr. Gowry, gamely returning to the house, limping after his tumble of
some weeks before, joked, laughed, and didn't quite blow his ear off
with one of the dueling pistols. Everyone roared but the party broke up
early. Gowry vowed never to return.
Then there was a Miss Kummer, who, staying overnight, borrowed Joshua's
electric razor and was almost but not quite electrocuted. She left the
house rubbing her right underarm. Joshua promptly grew a beard.
Soon after, a Mr. Schlagel vanished. So did a Mr. Smith. The last seen
of these unfortunates was at a Saturday night soiree at the Enderbys'
mansion.
"Hide-and-seek?" Friends slapped Joshua's back jovially.
"How do you do it? Kill 'em with toadstools, plant 'em like mushrooms?"
"Grand joke, yes!" chortled Joshua. "No, no, ha, not toadstools, but one
got locked in our stand-up fridge. Overnight Eskimo Pie. The other
tripped on a croquet hoop. Defenestrated through a greenhouse window."
"Eskimo Pie, defenestrated!" hooted the party people. "Dear Joshua,
you are a card!"
"I speak only the truth," Joshua protested.
"What won't you think of next?"
"One wonders what did happen to old Schlagel and that rascal Smith."
-   -   *

"What did happen to Schlagel and Smith?" Missy inquired some days later.
"Let me explain. The Eskimo Pie was my dessert. But the croquet hoop?
No! Did you spot it in the wrong place, hoping I'd pop by and lunge
through the greenhouse panes?"
Missy turned to stone; he had touched a nerve.
"Well, now, it's time for a wee talk," he said. "Cancel the parties. One
more victim and sirens will announce the arrival of the law."
"Yes," Missy agreed. "Our target practice seems to wind up in ricochet.
About that croquet hoop. You always take midnight greenhouse walks. Why
was that damn fool Schlagel stumbling about out there at two a.m.? Dumb
ox. Is he still under the compost?"
"Until I stash him with he-who-is-frozen."
"Dear, dear. No more parties."
"Just you, me and-ah-the chandelier?"
"Ah, no. I've hid the stepladder so you can't climb!"
"Damn," said Joshua.
That night by the fireplace, he poured a few glasses of their best port.
While he was out of the room, answering the telephone, she dropped a
little white powder in her own glass.
"Hate this," she murmured. "Terribly unoriginal. But there won't be an
inquest. He looked long dead before he died, they'll say as they shut
the lid." And she added a touch more lethal stuff to her port just as he
wandered in to sit and pluck up his glass. He .eyed it and fixed his
wife a grin. "Ah, no, no, you don't!"
"Don't what?" she said, all innocence.
The fire crackled warmly, gently on the hearth. The mantel clock ticked.
"You don't mind, do you, my dear, if we exchange drinks?"
"Surely you don't think I poisoned your drink while you were out?"
"Trite. Banal. But possible."
"Well, then, fussbudget, trade."
He looked surprised but traded glasses.
"Here's not looking at you!" both said, and laughed.
They drank with mysterious smiles.
And then they sat with immense satisfaction in their easy chairs, the
firelight glimmering on their ghost-pale faces, letting the port warm
their almost spidery veins. He stuck his legs out and held one hand to
the fire. "Ah." He sighed.
"Nothing, nothing quite like port!"
She leaned her small gray head back, dozing, gumming her red-sticky
mouth, and glancing at him with half-secretive, lazy eyes. "Poor Lila,"
she murmured.
"Yes," he murmured. "Lila. Poor."
The fire popped and she at last added, "Poor Mr. Schlagel."
"Yes." He drowsed. "Poor Schlagel. Don't forget Smith."
"And you, old man," she said finally, slowly, slyly. "How do you feel?'
"Sleepy."
"Very sleepy?"
"Un-huh." He studied her with bright eyes. "And, my dear, what about
you?"
"Sleepy," she said behind closed eyes. Then they popped wide. "Why all
these questions?"
"Indeed," he said, stirring alert. "Why?"
"Oh, well, because . . ." She examined her little black shoe moving in a
low rhythm a long way off below her knee. "I think, or perhaps imagine,
I have just destroyed your digestive and nervous systems."
For the moment he was drowsily content and examined the warm fire and
listened to the clock tick. "What you mean is that you have just
poisoned me?" He dreamed the words. "You what!?" He jumped as all the
air gusted from his body. The port glass shattered on the floor.
She leaned forward like a fortune-teller eagerly predicting futures.
"I cleverly poisoned my own drink and knew that you'd ask to trade off,
so you felt safe. And we did!" Her laugh tinkled.
He fell back in his chair, clutching at his face to stop the wild
swiveling of his eyes. Then suddenly he remembered something and let out
an incredible explosion of laughter.
"Why," cried Missy, "why are you laughing?"
"Because," he gasped, tears streaming down his cheeks, his mouth
grinning horribly, "I poisoned my drink! and hoped for an excuse to
change with you!"
"Oh, dear," she cried, no longer smiling. "How stupid of us. Why didn't
I guess?"
"Because both of us are much too clever by far!" And he lay back,
chortling.
"Oh, the mortification, the embarrassment, I feel stark naked and hate
myself!"
"No, no," he husked. "Think instead how much you still hate me."
"With all my withered heart and soul. You?"
"No deathbed forgiveness here, old lily-white iron-maiden wife 0 mine.
Cheerio," he added faintly, far away.
"If you think I'll say 'Cheerio' back, you're crazed," she whispered,
her head rolling to one side, her eyes clamped,
her mouth gone loose around the words. "But what the hell. Cheer-"
At which her breath ceased and the fire burned to ashes as the clock
ticked and ticked in the quiet room.
Friends found them strewn in their library chairs the next day, both
looking more than usually pleased with their situation.
"A suicide pact," said all. "So great their love they could not bear to
let the other vanish alone into eternity."
"I hope," said Mr. Gowry, on his crutches, "my wife will someday join me
in similar drinks."
QUICKER THAN THE EYE
It was at a magic show I saw the man who looked enough like me to be my
twin.
My wife and I were seated at a Saturday night performance, it was summer
and warm, the audience melting in weather and conviviality. All around I
saw married and engaged couples delighted and then alarmed by the comic
opera of their lives which was being shown in immense symbol onstage.
A woman was sawed in half. How the husbands in the audience smiled.
A woman in a cabinet vanished. A bearded magician wept for her in
despair. Then, at the tip-top of the balcony, she appeared, waving a
white-powdered hand, infinitely beautiful, unattainable, far away.
How the wives grinned their cat grins!
"Look at them!" I said to my wife.
A woman floated in midair. .. a goddess born in all men's minds by their
own true love. Let not her dainty feet touch earth. Keep her on that
invisible pedestal. Watch it! God, don't tell me how it's
done, anyone! Ah, look at her float, and dream.
And what was that man who spun plates, globes, stars, torches, his
elbows twirling hoops, his nose balancing a blue feather, sweating
everything at once! What, I asked myself, but the commuter husband,
lover, worker, the quick luncher, juggling hour, Benzedrine, Nembutal,
bank balances, and budgets?
Obviously, none of us had come to escape the world outside, but rather
to have it tossed back at us in more easily digested forms, brighter,
cleaner, quicker, neater; a spectacle both heartening and melancholy.
Who in life has not seen a woman disappear?
There, on the black, plush stage, women, mysteries of talc and rose
petal, vanished. Cream alabaster statues, sculptures of summer lily and
fresh rain melted to dreams, and the dreams became empty mirrors even as
the magician reached hungrily to seize them.
From cabinets and nests of boxes, from flung sea-nets, shattering like
porcelain as the conjurer fired his gun, the women vanished.
Symbolic, I thought. Why do magicians point pistols at lovely
assistants, unless through some secret pact with the male subconscious?
"What?" asked my wife.
"Eh?"
"You were muttering," said my wife.
"Sorry." I searched the program. "Oh! Next comes Miss Quick!
The only female pickpocket in the world!"
"That can't be true," said my wife quietly.
I looked to see if she was joking. In the dark, her dim mouth seemed to
be smiling, but the quality of that smile was lost to me.
The orchestra hummed like a serene flight of bees.
The curtains parted.
There, with no great fanfare, no swirl of cape, no bow, only the most
condescending tilt of her head, and the faintest elevation of her left
eyebrow, stood Miss Quick.
I thought it was a dog act, when she snapped her fingers.
"Volunteers. All men!"
"Sit down." My wife pulled at me.
I had risen.
There was a stir. Like so many hounds, a silently baying pack rose and
walked (or did they run?) to the snapping of Miss Quick's colorless
fingernails.
It was obvious instantly that Miss Quick was the same woman who had been
vanishing all evening.
Budget show, I thought; everyone doubles in brass. I don't like her.
"What?" asked my wife.
"Am I talking out loud again?"
But really, Miss Quick provoked me. For she looked as if she had gone
backstage, shrugged on a rumpled tweed walking suit, one size too large,
gravy-spotted and grass-stained, and then purposely rumpled her hair,
painted her lipstick askew, and was on the point of exiting the stage
door when someone cried, "You're on!"
So here she was now, in her practical shoes, her nose shiny, her hands
in motion but her face immobile, getting it over with .
Feet firmly and resolutely planted, she waited, her hands deep in her
lumpy tweed pockets, her mouth cool, as the dumb volunteers dogged it to
the stage.
This mixed pack she set right with a few taps, lining them up in a
military row.
The audience waited.
“That's all! Act's over! Back to your seats!"
Snap! went her plain fingers.
The men, dismayed, sheepishly peering at each other, ambled off. She let
them stumble half down the stairs into darkness, then yawned:
"Haven't you forgotten something?"
Eagerly, they turned.
"Here."
With a smile like the very driest wine, she lazily unwedged a wallet
from one of her pockets. She removed another wallet from within her
coat. Followed by a third, a fourth, a fifth! Ten wallets in all!
She held them forth, like biscuits, to good beasts. The men blinked. No,
those were not their wallets! They had been onstage for only an instant.
She had mingled with them only in passing. It was all a joke. Surely she
was offering them brand-new wallets, compliments of the show!
But now the men began feeling themselves, like sculptures finding unseen
flaws in old, hastily flung together armatures. Their mouths gaped,
their hands grew more frantic, slapping their chest-pockets, digging
their pockets.
All the while Miss Quick ignored them to calmly sort their wallets like
the morning mail.
It was at this precise moment I noticed the man on the far right end of
the line, half on the stage. I lifted my opera glasses. I looked once. I
looked twice.
"Well," I said lightly. "There seems to be a man there who somewhat
resembles me."
"Oh?" said my wife.
I handed her the glasses, casually. "Far right."
"It's not like you," said my wife. "It's you!"
"Well, almost," I said modestly.
The fellow was nice-looking. It was hardly cricket to look thus upon
yourself and pronounce favorable verdicts. Simultaneously, I had grown
quite cold. I took back the opera glasses and nodded, fascinated. "Crew
cut. Horn-rimmed glasses. Pink complexion. Blue eyes-"
"Your absolute twin!" cried my wife.
And this was true. And it was strange, sitting there, watching myself
onstage.
"No, no, no," I kept whispering.
But yet, what my mind refused, my eye accepted. Aren't there two billion
people in this world? Yes! All different snowflakes, no two the same!
But now here, delivered into my gaze, endangering my ego and my
complacency, here was a casting from the same absolutes, the identical
mold.
Should I believe, disbelieve, feel proud, or run scared? For here I
stood witness to the forgetfulness of God.
"I don't think," said God, "I've made one like this before."
But, I thought, entranced, delighted, alarmed: God errs.
Flashes from old psychology books lit my mind.
Heredity. Environment.
"Smith! Jones! Helstrom!"
Onstage, in bland drill-sergeant tones, Miss Quick called roll and
handed back the stolen goods.
You borrow your body from all your forebears, I thought. Heredity.
But isn't the body also an environment?
"Winters!"
Environment, they say, surrounds you. Well, doesn't the body surround,
with its lakes, its architectures of bone, its overabundances, or
wastelands of soul? Does not what is seen in passing window-mirrors, a
face either serene snowfalls or a pitted abyss, the hands like swans or
sparrows, the feet anvils or hummingbirds, the body a lumpy wheat-sack
or a summer fern, do these not, seen, paint the mind, set the image,
shape the brain and psyche like clay? They do!
"Bidwell! Rogers!"
Well, then, trapped in the same environmental flesh, how fared this
stranger onstage?
In the old fashion, I wanted to leap to my feet and call, "What o'clock
is it?"
And he, like the town crier passing late with my face, might half
mournfully reply, "Nine o'clock, and all's well
But was all well with him?
Question: did those horn-rims cover a myopia not only of light but of
spirit?
Question: was the slight obesity pressed to his skeleton symbolic of a
similar gathering of tissue in his head?
In sum, did his soul go north while mine went south, the same flesh
cloaking us but our minds reacting, one winter, one summer?
"My God," I said, half aloud. "Suppose we're absolutely identical!"
"Shh!" said a woman behind me.
I swallowed hard.
Suppose, I thought, he is a chain-smoker, light sleeper,
overeater,  manic-depressive,  glib  talker,  deep/shallow thinker,
flesh fancier...
No one with that body, that face, could be otherwise. Even our names
must be similar.
Our names!
“...1...bl . . . er...” .
Miss Quick spoke his!
Someone coughed. I missed it.
Perhaps she'd repeat it. But no, he, my twin, moved forward. Damn! He
stumbled! The audience laughed.
I focused my binoculars swiftly.
My twin stood quietly, center stage now, his wallet returned to his
fumbling hands.
"Stand straight," I whispered. "Don't slouch."
"Shh!" said my wife.
I squared my own shoulders, secretly.
I never knew I looked that fine, I thought, cramming the glasses to my
eyes. Surely my nostrils aren't that thinly made, the true aristocrat.
Is my skin that fresh and handsome, my chin that firm?
I blushed, in silence.
After all, if my wife said that was me, accept it! The lamplight of pure
intelligence shone softly from every pore of his face.
"The glasses." My wife nudged me.
Reluctantly I gave them up.
She trained the glasses rigidly, not on the man, but now on Miss Quick,
who was busy cajoling, flirting, and repicking the pockets of the
nearest men. On occasion my wife broke into a series of little satisfied
snorts and giggles.
Miss Quick was, indeed, the goddess Shiva.
If I saw two hands, I saw nine. Her hands, an aviary, flew, rustled,
tapped, soared, petted, whirled, tickled as Miss Quick, her face blank,
swarmed coldly over her victims; touched without touching.
"What's in this pocket? And this? And here?"
She shook their vests, pinched their lapels, jingled their trousers:
money rang. She punched them lightly with a vindictive forefinger,
ringing totals on cash registers. She unplucked coat buttons with
mannish yet fragile motions, gave wallets back, sneaked them away. She
thrust them, took them, stole them again, while peeling money to count
it behind the men's backs, then snatched their watches while
holding their hands.
She trapped a live doctor now!
"Have you a thermometer!?" she asked.
"Yes." He searched. His face panicked. He searched again. The audience
cued him with a roar. He glanced over to find:
Miss Quick standing with the thermometer in her mouth, like an unlit
smoke. She whipped it out, eyed it.
"Temperature!" she cried. "One hundred ten!"
She closed her eyes and gave an insincere shake of her hips.
The audience roared. And now she assaulted her victims, bullied them,
tugged at their shirts, rumpled their hair, asked:
"Where's your tie?"
They clapped their hands to their empty collars.
She plucked their ties from nowhere, tossed them back.
She was a magnet that invisibly drew good-luck charms, saints' medals,
Roman coins, theater stubs, handkerchiefs, stickpins, while the audience
ran riot, convulsed as these rabbit men stood peeled of all prides and
protections.
Hold your hip pocket, she vacuumed your vest. Clutch your vest, she
jackpotted your trousers. Blithely bored, firm but evanescent, she
convinced you you missed nothing, until she extracted it, with faint
loathing, from her own tweeds moments later.
"What's this?!" She held up a letter. "'Dear Helen: Last night with
you-’”
A furious blush as the victim tussled with Miss Quick, snatched the
letter, stowed it away. But a moment later, the letter was restolen and
reread aloud: "'Dear Helen: Last night-'"
So the battle raged. One woman. Ten men.
She kissed one, stole his belt.
Stole another's suspenders.
The women in the audience-whinnied.
Their men, shocked, joined in.
What a magnificent bully, Miss Quick! How she spanked her dear,
idiot-grinning, carry-on-somehow men turned boys as she spun them like
cigar-store Indians, knocked them with her brontosaur hip, leaned on
them like barber-poles, calling each one cute or lovely or handsome.
This night, I thought, is lunatic! All about me, wives, hilarious with
contempt, hysterical at being so shabbily revealed in their national
pastimes, gagged for air. Their husbands sat stunned, as if a war were
over that had not been declared, fought and lost before they could move.
Each, nearby, had the terrible look of a man who fears his throat is
cut, and that a sneeze would fill the aisle with heads .
Quickly! I thought. Do something!
"You, you onstage, my twin, dodge! Escape!"
And she was coming at him!
"Be firm!" I told my twin. "Strategy! Duck, weave. Zigzag. Don't look
where she says. Look where she doesn't say! Go it! now!"
If I shouted this, or merely ground it to powder in my teeth, I don't
recall, for all the men froze as Miss Quick seized my twin by the hand.
"Careful!" I whispered.
Too late. His watch was gone. He didn't know it. Your watch is gone! I
thought. He doesn't know what time it is! I thought.
Miss Quick stroked his lapel. Back off! I warned myself.
Too late. His forty-dollar pen was gone. He didn't know it. She tweaked
his nose. He smiled. Idiot! There went his wallet. Not your nose, fool,
your coat!
"Padded?" She pinched his shoulder. He looked at his right arm. No! I
cried silently, for now she had the letters out of his left coat pocket.
She planted a red kiss on his brow and backed off with everything else
he had on him, coins, identification, a package of chocolates which she
ate, greedily. Use the sense God gave a cow! I shouted behind my face.
Blind! See what she's doing!
She whirled him round, measured him, and said, "This yours?" and
returned his tie.
My wife was hysterical. She still held the glasses fixed on every nuance
and vibration of loss and deprivation on the poor idiot's face. Her
mouth was spoiled with triumph.
My God! I cried in the uproar. Get off the stage! I yelled within,
wishing I could really yell it. At least get out while you
have some pride!
The laughter had erupted a volcano in the theater, high and rumbling and
dark. The dim grotto seemed lit with unhealthy fever, an incandescence.
My twin wanted to break off, like one of Pavlov's dogs, too many bells
on too many days: no reward, no food. His eyes were glazed with his
insane predicament.
Fall! Jump in the pit! Crawl away! I thought.
The orchestra sawed at destiny with violins and Valkyrian trumpets in
full flood.
With one last snatch, one last contemptuous wag of her body, Miss Quick
grasped my twin's clean white shirt, and yanked it off.
She threw the shirt in the air. As it fell, so did his pants As his
pants fell, unbelted, so did the theater. An avalanche of shock soared
to bang the rafters and roll over us in echoes a thundering hilarity.
The curtain fell.
We sat, covered with unseen rubble. Drained of blood, buried in one
upheaval after another, degraded and autopsied and, minus eulogy, tossed
into a mass grave, we men took a minute to stare at that dropped
curtain, behind which hid the pickpocket and her victims, behind which a
man quickly hoisted his trousers up his spindly legs.
A burst of applause, a prolonged tide on a dark shore. Miss Quick did
not appear to bow. She did not need to. She was standing behind the
curtain. I could feel her there, no smile, no expression. Standing,
coldly estimating the caliber of the applause, comparing it to the
metered remembrances of other nights.
I jumped up in an absolute rage. I had, after all, failed myself. When I
should have ducked, I bobbed; when I should have backed off, I ran in.
What an ass!
"What a fine show!" said my wife as we milled through the departing
audience.
"Fine!" I cried.
"Didn't you like it?"
"All except the pickpocket. Obvious act, overdone, no subtlety," I said,
lighting a cigarette.
"She was a whiz!"
"This way." I steered my wife toward the stage door.
"Of course," said my wife blandly, "that man, the one who looks like
you, he was a plant. They call them shills, don't they? Paid by the
management to pretend to be part of the audience?"
"No man would take money for a spectacle like that," I said. "No, he was
just some boob who didn't know how to be careful."
"What are we doing back here?"
Blinking around, we found we were backstage.
Perhaps I wished to stride up to my twin, shouting, "Half-baked ox!
Insulter of all men! Play a flute: you dance. Tickle your chin: you jump
like a puppet! Jerk!"
The truth was, of course, I must see my twin close-up, confront the
traitor and see where his true flesh differed from mine. After all,
wouldn't I have done better in his place?!
The backstage was lit in blooms and isolated flushes, now bright, now
dark, where the other magicians stood chatting. And there, there was
Miss Quick!
And there, smiling, was my twin!
"You did fine, Charlie," said Miss Quick.
My twin's name was Charlie. Stupid name.
Charlie patted Miss Quick's cheek. "You did fine, ma'am!"
God, it was true! A shill, a confederate. Paid what? Five, ten dollars
for letting his shirt be torn oft, letting his pants drop with his
pride? What a turncoat, traitor!
I stood, glaring.
He glanced up.
Perhaps he saw me.
Perhaps some bit of my rage and impacted sorrow reached him.
He held my gaze for only a moment, his mouth wide, as if he had just
seen an old school chum. But, not remembering my name, could not call
out, so let the moment pass.
He saw my rage. His face paled. His smile died. He glanced quickly away.
He did not look up again, but stood pretending to listen to Miss Quick,
who was laughing and talking with the other magicians.
I stared at him and stared again. Sweat oiled his face. My hate melted.
My temper cooled. I saw his profile clearly, his chin, eyes, nose,
hairline; I memorized it all. Then I heard someone say:
"It was a fine show!"
My wife, moving forward, shook the hand of the pickpocketing beast.
On the street, I said, "Well, I'm satisfied."
"About what?" asked my wife.
"He doesn't look like me at all. Chin's too sharp. Nose is smaller.
Lower lip isn't full enough. Too much eyebrow. Onstage, far oft, had me
going. But close up, no, no. It was the crew cut and horn-rims fooled
us. Anyone could have horn-rims and a crew cut."
"Yes," my wife agreed, "anyone."
As she climbed into our car, I could not help but admire her long,
lovely legs.
Driving off, I thought I glimpsed that familiar face in the passing
crowd. The face, however, was watching me. I wasn't sure. Resemblances,
I now knew, are superficial.
The face vanished in the crowd.
"I'll never forget," said my wife, "when his pants-fell!" I drove very
fast, then drove very slow, all the way home.
DORIAN IN EXCELSUS
Good evening. Welcome. I see you have my invitation in your hands.
Decided to be brave, did you? Fine. Here we are Grab onto this."
The tall, handsome stranger with the heavenly eyes and the impossibly
blond hair handed me a wineglass.
"Clean your palate," he said.
I took the glass and read the label on the bottle he held in his left
hand. Bordeaux, it read. St. Emilion.
"Go on," said my host. "It's not poison. May I sit? And might
you drink?"
"I might," I sipped, shut my eyes, and smiled. "You're a connoisseur.
This is the best I've had in years. But why this wine and why the
invitation? What am I doing here at Gray's Anatomy Bar and Grill?"
My host sat and filled his own glass. "I am doing a favor to myself.
This is a great night, perhaps for both of us. Greater than Christmas or
Halloween." His lizard tongue darted into his wine to vanish back into
his contentment. "We celebrate my being honored, at last becoming-"
He exhaled it all out:
"Becoming," he said, "a friend to Dorian! Dorian's friend. Me!"
"Ah." I laughed. "That explains the name of this place, then? Does
Dorian own Gray's Anatomy?"
"More! Inspires and rules over it. And deservedly so."
"You make it sound as if being a friend to Dorian is the most important
thing in the world."
"No! In life! In all of life." He rocked back and forth, drunk not from
the wine but from some inner joy. "Guess."
"At what?"
"How old I am!"
"You look to be twenty-nine at the most."
"Twenty-nine. What a lovely sound. Not thirty, forty, or fifty, but-"
I said, "I hope you're not going to ask what sign I was born under. I
usually leave when people ask that. I was born on the cusp, August,
1920." I pretended to half rise. He pressed a gentle hand to my lapel.
"No, no, dear boy-you don't understand. Look here. And here." He touched
under his eyes and then around his neck. "Look for wrinkles."
"But you have none," I said.
"How observant. None. And that is why I have become this very night a
fresh, new, stunningly handsome friend to Dorian."
"I still don't see the connection."
"Look at the backs of my hands." He showed his wrists. "No liver spots.
I am not turning to rust. I repeat the question, how old am I?"
I swirled the wine in my glass and studied his reflection in the swirl.
"Sixty?" I guessed. "Seventy?"
"Good God!" He fell back in his chair, astonished. "How did you know?"
"Word association. You've been rattling on about Dorian. I know my Oscar
Wilde, I know my Dorian Gray, which means you, sir, have a portrait of
yourself stashed in an attic aging while you yourself, drinking old
wine, stay young."
"No, no." The handsome stranger leaned forward.
"Not stayed young. Became young. I was old, very old, and it took a
year, but the clock went back and after a year of playing at it,
I achieved what I set out for."
"Twenty-nine was your target?"
"How clever you are!"
"And once you became twenty-nine you were fully elected as-"
"A Friend to Dorian! Bulls-eye! But there is no portrait, no attic,
no staying young. It's becoming young again's the ticket."
"I'm still puzzled!"
"Child of my heart, you might possibly be another Friend. Come along.
Before the greatest revelation, let me show you the far end of the room
and some doors."
He seized my hand. "Bring your wine. You'll need it!" He hustled me
along through the tables in a swiftly filling room of mostly middle-aged
and some fairly young men, and a few smoke-exhaling ladies. I jogged
along, staring back at the EXIT as if my future life were there.
Before us stood a golden door.
"And behind the door?" I asked.
"What always lies behind any golden door?" my host responded. "Touch."
I reached out to print the door with my thumb.
"What do you feel?" my host inquired.
"Youngness, youth, beauty." I touched again. "All the springtimes that
ever were or ever will be."
"Jeez, the man's a poet. Push."
We pushed and the golden door swung soundlessly wide.
"Is this where Dorian is?"
"No, no, only his students, his disciples, his almost Friends. Feast
your eyes."
I did as I was told and saw, at the longest bar in the world, a line of
men, a lineage of young men, reflecting and re-reflecting each other as
in a fabled mirror maze, that illusion seen where mirrors face each
other and you find yourself repeated to infinity, large, small, very
small, smallest, GONE! The young men were all staring down the long bar
at us and then, as if unable to pull their gaze away, at themselves. You
could almost hear their cries of appreciation. And with each cry, they
grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful...
I gazed upon a tapestry of beauty, a golden phalanx freshly out of the
Elysian fields and hills. The gates of mythology swung wide and Apollo
and his demi-Apollos glided forth, each more beautiful than the last.
I must have gasped. I heard my host inhale as if he drank my wine.
"Yes, aren't they," he said.
"Come," whispered my new friend. "Run the gauntlet. Don't linger; you
may find tiger-tears on your sleeve and blood rising. Now."
And he glided, he undulated, me along on his soundless tuxedo slippers,
his fingers a pale touch on my elbow, his breath a flower scent too
near. I heard myself say:
"It's been written that H. G. Wells attracted women with his breath,
which smelled of honey. Then I learned that such breath comes with
illness."
"How clever. Do I smell of hospitals and medicines?"
"I didn't mean-"
"Quickly. You're rare meat in the zoo. Hup, two, three!"
"Hold on," I said, breathless not from walking fast but from perceiving
quickly. "This man, and the next, and the one after that-"
''Yes?!"
"My God," I said, "they're almost all the same, look-alikes!"
"Bull's-eye, half true! And the next and the next after that, as far
behind as we have gone, as far ahead as we might go. All twenty-nine
years old, all golden tan, all six feet tall, white of teeth, bright of
eye. Each different but beautiful, like me!"
I glanced at him and saw what I saw around me. Similar but different
beauties. So much youngness I was stunned.
"Isn't it time you told me your name?"
"Dorian."
"But you said you were his Friend."
"I am. They are. But we all share his name. This chap here. And the
next. Oh, once we had commoner names. Smith and Jones. Harry and Phil.
Jimmy and Jake. But then we signed up to become Friends."
"Is that why I was invited? To sign up?"
"I saw you in a bar across town a year ago, made queries. A year later,
you look the proper age-"
"Proper-?"
"Well, aren't you? Just leaving sixty-nine, arriving at seventy?"
''Well.''
"My God! Are you happy being seventy?"
"It'll do.''
"Do? Wouldn't you like to be really happy, steal some wild
oats? Sow them?!"
"That time's over."
"It's not. I asked and you came, curious.
"Curious about what?"
"This." He bared me his neck again and flexed his pale white wrists.
"And all those!" He waved at the fine faces as we passed. "Dorian's
sons. Don't you want to be gloriously wild and young like them?"
"How can I decide?"
"Lord, you've thought of it all night for years. Soon you could
be part of this!"
We had reached the far end of the line of men with bronzed faces, white
teeth, and breath like H. G. Wells' scent of honey ...
"Aren't you tempted?" he pursued. "Will you refuse-"
"Immortality?"
"No! To live the next twenty years, die at ninety, and look twenty-nine
in the damn tomb! In the mirror over there-what do you see?"
"An old goat among ten dozen fauns."
"Yes!"
"Where do I sign up?" I laughed.
"Do you accept?"
"No, I need more facts."
"Damn! Here's the second door. Get in!"
He swung wide a door, more golden than the first, shoved me, followed,
and slammed the door. I stared at darkness.
"What's this?" I whispered.
"Dorian's Gym, of course. If you work out here all year, hour by hour,
day by day, you get younger."
"That's some gym," I observed, trying to adjust my eyes to the dim areas
beyond where shadows tumbled, and voices rustled and whispered. "I've
heard of gyms that help keep, not make, you young . . . Now tell me...
"I read your mind. For every old man that became young in there at the
bar, is there an attic portrait?"
"Well, is there?"
"No! There's only Dorian."
"A single person? Who grows old for all of you?"
"Touche'! Behold his gym!"
I gazed off into a vast high arena where a hundred shadows stirred and
moaned like a tide on a terrible shore.
"I think it's time to leave," I said.
"Nonsense. Come. No one will see you. They're all... busy. I am Moses,"
said the sweet breath at my elbow. "And I hereby tell the Red Sea
to part!"
And we moved along a path between two tides, each shadowed, each more
terrifying with its gasps, its cries, its slip-pages of flesh, its
slapping like waves, its repeated whispers for more, more, ah, God,
more!
I ran, but my host grabbed on. "Look right, left, now right again!"
There must have been a hundred, two hundred animals, beasts, no, men
wrestling, leaping, falling, rolling in darkness. It was a sea of flesh,
undulant, a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats, a glistening of
skin, flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes, spun on leather horses,
or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of
lamentations and muffled cries. I stared across an ocean of rising and
falling shapes. My ears were scorched by their bestial moans.
"What, my God," I exclaimed, "does it all mean?"
"There. See."
And above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window,
forty feet wide and ten feet tall, and behind that cold glass Something
watching, savoring, alert, one vast stare.
And over all there was the suction of a great breath, a vast inhalation
which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible
need. As the shadows tumbled and writhed, this inhalation tugged at them
and the raw air in my nostrils. Somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked
in darkness but did not exhale. There were long pauses as the shadows
flailed and fell, and then another savoring inhalation. It swallowed
breath. In, in, always in, devouring the sweaty air, hungering the
passions.
And the shadows were pulled, I was pulled, toward that vast glass eye,
that immense window behind which a shapeless Something stared to dine on
gymnasium airs.
"Dorian?" I guessed.
"Come meet him."
"Yes, but . . ." I watched the wild, convulsive shadows. "What are they
doing?"
"Go find out. Afraid? Cowards never live. So!"
He swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive, I
could not feel, for suddenly I lurched into a hothouse as the door
slammed and was locked by my blond young friend. "Ready?"
"Lord, I must go home!"
"Not until you meet," said my host, "him."
He pointed. At first I could see nothing. The lights were dim and the
place, like the gymnasium, was mostly shadow. I smelled jungle greens.
The air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes. I smelled papaya and
mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an
unseen tide. But the tide was there with that immense inhaled breathing
that rose and was quiet and began again.
"I see no one," I said.
"Let your eyes adjust. Wait."
I waited. I watched.
There were no chairs in the room, for there was no need of chairs.
He did not sit, he did not recline, he "prolonged" himself on the
largest bed in history. The dimensions might easily have been fifteen
feet by twenty. It reminded me of the apartment of a writer I once knew
who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women
stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs.
So it was with this nest, with Dorian, immense, a gelatinous skin, a
vitreous shape, undulant within that nest.
And if Dorian was male or female, I could not guess. This was a great
pudding, an emperor jellyfish, a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from
the exterior of which, on occasion, noxious gases escaped with rubbery
sounds; great lips sibilating. That and the sough of that labored pump,
that constant inhalation, were the only sounds within the chamber as I
stood, anxious, alarmed, but at last impressed by this beached creature,
cast up from a dark landfall. The thing was a gelatinous cripple, an
octopus without limbs, an amphibian stranded, unable to undulate and
seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous
waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay,
featureless, with a mere x-ray ghost of legs, arms, wrists, and hands
with skeletal fingers. At last I could discern, at the far end of this
flesh peninsula, what seemed a half-flat face with a frail phantom of
skull beneath, an open fissure for an eye, a ravenous nostril, and a red
wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth.
And at last this thing, this Dorian, spoke.
Or whispered, or lisped.
And with each lisp, each sibilance, an odor of decay was expelled as if
from a vast night-swamp balloon, sunk on its side, lost in fetid water
as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks. It expelled but one lingering
syllable:
Yessss.
Yes what?
And then it added:
Soooo...
"How long . . . how long," I murmured, "has it . . . has he been here?"
"No one knows. When Victoria was Queen? When Booth emptied his makeup
kit to load his pistol? When Napoleon yellow-stained the Moscow snows?
Forever's not bad .
What else?"
I swallowed hard. "Is . . . is he?"
"Dorian? Dorian of the attic? He of the Portrait? And somewhere along
the line found portraits not enough? Oil, canvas, no depth. The world
needed something that could soak in, sponge the midnight rains,
breakfast and lunch on loss, depravity's guilt. Something to truly take
in, drink, digest; a pustule, imperial intestine. A rheum oesophagus for
sin. A laboratory plate to take bacterial snows. Dorian."
The long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and
valves, and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the
aqueous gels.
A slit widened to emit gas and again the single word:
Yessss .
"He's welcoming you!" My host smiled.
"I know, I know," I said impatiently. "But why? I don't even want to be
here. I'm ill. Why can't we go?"
"Because"-my host laughed-"you were selected.
"Selected?"
"We've had our eye on you."
"You mean you've watched, followed, spied on me? Christ, who gave
you permission?"
"Temper, temper. Not everyone is picked."
"Who said I wanted to be picked!?"
"If you could see yourself as we see you, you'd know why."
I turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint
creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it
stare. Then all its apertures sealed: the saber-cut mouth, the slitted
nostrils, the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless. The
sibilance pumped with gaseous suctions.
Yessss, it whispered.
Lisssst, it murmured.
"And list it is!" My host pulled forth a small computer pad which he
tapped to screen my name, address, and phone.
He glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me.
"Single," he said.
"Married and divorced."
"Now single! No women in your life?"
"I'm walking wounded."
He tapped his pad. "Visiting strange bars."
"I hadn't noticed."
"Creative blindness. Getting to bed late. Sleeping all day. Drinking
heavily three nights a week."
"Twice!"
"Going to the gym, look, every day. Workouts excessive. Prolonged steam
baths, overlong massages. Sudden interest in sports. Endless basketball,
soccer, tennis matches every night, and half the
noons. That's hyperventilation!"
''My business!"
"And ours! You're balanced giddily on the rim. Shove all these facts in
that one-armed bandit in your head, yank, and watch the lemons and ripe
cherries spin. Yank!"
Jesus God. Yes! Bars. Drinks. Late nights. Gyms. Saunas. Masseurs.
Basketball. Tennis. Soccer. Yank. Pull. Spin!
"Well?" My host searched my face, amused. "Three jackpot cherries in a
row?"
I shuddered.
"Circumstance. No court would convict me."
"This court elects you. We tell palms to read ravenous groins. Yes?"
Gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless
mound. Yessss.
They say that men in the grip of passion, blind to their own darkness,
make love and run mad. Stunned by guilt, they find themselves beasts,
having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church, town,
parents, life. In explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure. Seeing
her as unholy provocateur, they kill. Women, in similar rages and
guilts, overdose. Eve lies self-slain in the Garden. Adam hangs himself
with the Snake as noose.
But here was no passionate crime, no woman, no provocateur, only the
great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host. And only words which
riddled me with fusillades of arrows. Like an Oriental hedgehog,
bristled with shafts, my body exploded with No, No, No. Echoed and then
real:
"No!"
Yessss, whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue, the skeleton buried
in ancient soups.
    Yessss.
I gasped to see my games, steams, midnight bars, late-dawn beds: a
maniac sum.
I rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked, creased,
and oiled by passion, so cobwebbed and smashed by drink, that I tried to
avert my gaze. The terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand.
Stupidly, I reached to shake his and-rapped glass! A mirror. I stared
deep into my own life. I had seen myself in shop windows, dim undersea
men running in creeks. Mornings, shaving, I saw my mirrored health.
But this! This troglodyte trapped in amber. Myself, snapshotted like ten
dozen sexual acrobats! And who jammed this mirror at me? My beautiful
host, and that corrupt flatulence beyond.
"You are selected," they whispered.
"I refuse!" I shrieked.
And whether I shrieked aloud or merely thought, a great furnace gaped.
The oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous streams. My beautiful host
fell back, stunned that their search beneath my skin, behind my mask,
had brought revulsion. Always when Dorian cried, "Friend," raw gymnast
teams had mobbed to catapult that armless, legless, featureless Sargasso
Sea. Before they had smothered to drown in his miasma, to arise,
embrace, and wrestle in the dark gymnasium, then run forth young to
assault a world.
And I? What had I dared to do, that quaked that membranous sac into
regurgitated whistling and broken winds?
"Idiot!" cried my host, all teeth and fists. "Out! Out!"
"Out," I cried, spun to obey, and tripped.
I do not clearly know what happened as I fell. And if it was a swift
reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that
putrescent mound, I cannot say. I knew no lightning shock of murder, yet
knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge. Forwhat? I thought. What
are you to Dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face, or
causes the slightest twitch of leg, arm, hand, or fingernail, as the
last fetid air from Dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils.
It was over in a second.
Something shoved me. Did my secret self, insulted, give that push? I was
flung as if on wires, knocked to sprawl at Dorian.
He gave two terrible cries, one of warning, one of despair.
I was recovered so in landing, I did not sink my hands deep in that
poisonous yeast, into that multiflorid Man of War jelly. I swear that I
touched, raked, scarified him with only one thing: the smallest
fingernail of my right hand.
My fingernail!
And so this Dorian was shot and foundered. And so the mammoth with
screams collapsed. And so the nauseous balloon sank, fold on midnight
fold, upon its own boneless sell, fissuring volcanic sulfurs, immense
rectal airs, outgassed whistles, and whimpers of self-pitying despair.
"Christ! What have you done!? Murderer! Damn you!" cried my host, riven
to stare at Dorian's exhaustions unto death.
He whirled to strike, but ran to reach the door and cry, "Lock
this! Lock! Whatever happens, for God's sake, don't open! Now!" The door
slammed. I ran to lock it and turn.
Quietly, Dorian was falling away.
He sank down and down, out of sight. Like a great membranous tent with
its poles removed, he vanished into the floor, down flues and vents on
all sides of his great platform nest. Vents obviously created for such a
massive disease-sac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas. Even as I
watched, the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents, and I
stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable
strata of discards and half-born fetuses had lain sucking at sins,
spoiled bones, and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty.
That perverse royalty, that lunatic monarch, gone, all gone. A last
choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death.
My God, I thought, even now, that, all that, that terrible miasma, that
stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on
clean shores where bathers come at dawn ...
Even now ...
I stood, eyes shut, waiting.
For what? There had to be a next thing, yes? It came.
There was a trembling, shivering, and then a quaking of the wall, but
especially the golden door behind me.
I spun to see as well as hear.
I saw the door shaken, and then bombarded from the other side. Fists
pummeled, struck, hammered. Voices cried out and screamed and then
shrieked.
I felt a great mass ram the door to shiver, to slam it on its hinges.
I stared, fearful that the door might explode and let in the flood tide
of nightmare-ravening, terrified beasts, the kennel of dying things. For
now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape, to beg for
mercy, were so terrible that I clamped my fists to my ears.
Dorian was gone, but they remained. Shrieks. Screams. Screams. Shrieks.
An avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell, yammering.
What must they look like now? I thought. All those bouquets. All those
beauties.
The police will come, I thought, soon. But .
No matter what ...
I would not unlock that door.
NO NEWS, OR WHAT KILLED THE DOG?
It was a day of holocausts, cataclysms, tornadoes, earth-quakes,
blackouts, mass murders, eruptions, and miscellaneous dooms, at the peak
of which the sun swallowed the earth and the stars vanished.
But to put it simply, the most respected member of the Bentley family up
and died.
Dog was his name, and dog he was.
The Bentleys, arising late Saturday morning, found Dog stretched on the
kitchen floor, his head toward Mecca, his paws neatly folded, his tail
not a-thump but silent for the first time in twenty years.
Twenty years! My God, everyone thought, could it really have been that
long? And now, without permission, Dog was cold and gone.
Susan, the younger daughter, woke everyone yelling:
"Something's wrong with Dog. Quick!"
Without bothering to don his bathrobe, Roger Bentley, in his underwear,
hurried out to look at that quiet beast on the
kitchen tiles. His wife, Ruth, followed, and then their son Skip,
twelve. The rest of the family, married and flown, Rodney and Sal, would
arrive later. Each in turn would say the same thing:
"No! Dog was forever."
Dog said nothing, but lay there like World War II, freshly finished, and
a devastation.
Tears poured down Susan's cheeks, then down Ruth Bentley's, followed in
good order by tears from Father and, at last, when it had sunk in, Skip.
Instinctively, they made a ring around Dog, kneeling to the floor to
touch him, as if this might suddenly make him sit up, smile as he always
did at his food, bark, and beat them to the door. But their touching did
nothing but increase their tears.
But at last they rose, hugged each other, and went blindly in search of
breakfast, in the midst of which Ruth Bentley said, stunned, "We can't
just leave him there."
Roger Bentley picked Dog up, gently, and moved him out on the patio, in
the shade, by the pool.
"What do we do next?"
"I don't know," said Roger Bentley. "This is the first death in the
family in years and-" He stopped, snorted, and shook his head. "I mean-"
"You meant exactly what you said," said Ruth Bentley. "If Dog wasn't
family, he was nothing. God, I loved him."
A fresh burst of tears ensued, during which Roger Bentley brought a
blanket to put over Dog, but Susan stopped him.
"No, no.1 want to see him. I won't be able to see him ever again. He's
so beautiful. He's so - old."
They all carried their breakfasts out on the patio to sit around Dog,
somehow feeling they couldn't ignore him by eating inside.
Roger Bentley telephoned his other children, whose response, after the
first tears, was the same: they'd be right over. Wait.
When the other children arrived, first Rodney, twenty-one, and then the
older daughter, Sal, twenty-four, a fresh storm of grief shook everyone
and then they sat silently for a moment, watching Dog for a miracle.
"What are your plans?" asked Rodney at last.
"I know this is silly," said Roger Bentley after an embarrassed pause.
"After all, he's only a dog-"
"Only!?" cried everyone instantly.
Roger had to back off. "Look, he deserves the Taj Mahal. What he'll get
is the Orion Pet Cemetery over in Burbank."
"Pet Cemetery!?" cried everyone, but each in a different way.
"My God," said Rodney, "that's silly!"
"What's so silly about it?" Skip's face reddened and his lip trembled.
"Dog, why, Dog was a pearl of. . . rare price.
"Yeah!" added Susan.
"Well, pardon me." Roger Bentley turned away to look at the pool, the
bushes, the sky. "I suppose I could call those trash people who pick up
dead bodies-"
"Trash people?" exclaimed Ruth Bentley.
"Dead bodies?" said Susan. "Dog isn't a dead body!"
"What is he, then?" asked Skip bleakly.
They all stared at Dog lying quietly there by the pool. "He's," blurted
Susan at last, "he's . . . he's my love!" Before the crying could start
again, Roger Bentley picked up the patio telephone, dialed the Pet
Cemetery, talked, and put the phone down.
"Two hundred dollars," he informed everyone. "Not bad."
"For Dog?" said Skip. "Not enough!"
"Are you really serious about this?" asked Ruth Bentley.
"Yeah," said Roger. "I've made fun of those places all my life. But,
now, seeing as how we'll never be able to visit Dog again-" He let a
moment pass. "They'll come take Dog at noon. Services tomorrow."
"Services!" Snorting, Rodney stalked to the rim of the pool and waved
his arms. "You won't get me to that!"
Everyone stared. Rodney turned at last and let his shoulders slump.
"Hell, I'll be there."
"Dog would never forgive you if you didn't." Susan snuffed and wiped her
nose.
But Roger Bentley had heard none of this. Staring at Dog, then his
family, and up to the sky, he shut his eyes and exhaled a great whisper:
"Oh, my God!" he said, eyes shut. "Do you realize that this is the first
terrible thing that's happened to our family? Have we ever been sick,
gone to the hospital? Been in an accident?"
He waited.
"No," said everyone.
"Gosh," said Skip.
"Gosh, indeed! You sure as hell notice accidents, sickness, hospitals."
"Maybe," said Susan, and had to stop and wait because her voice broke.
"Maybe Dog died just to make us notice how lucky we are."
"Lucky?!" Roger Bentley opened his eyes and turned. "Yes! You know what
we are-”
"The science fiction generation," offered Rodney, lighting a cigarette
casually.
"What?"
"You rave on about that, your school lectures, or during dinner. Can
openers? Science fiction. Automobiles. Radio, TV, films. Everything! So
science fiction!"
"Well, dammit, they are!" cried Roger Bentley and went to stare at Dog,
as if the answers were there amongst the last departing fleas. "Hell,
not so long ago there were no cars, can openers, TV. Someone had to
dream them. Start of lecture. Someone had to build them. Mid-lecture. So
science fiction dreams became finished science fact. Lecture finis!”
"I bet!" Rodney applauded politely.
Roger Bentley could only sink under the weight of his son’s irony to
stroke the dear dead beast.
"Sorry. Dog bit me. Can't help myself. Thousands of years, all we did is
die. Now, that time's over. In sum: science fiction."
"Bull." Rodney laughed. "Stop reading that junk, Dad."
"Junk?" Roger touched Dog's muzzle. "Sure. But how about Lister,
Pasteur, Salk? Hated death. Jumped to stop it. That's all science
fiction was ever about. Hating the way things are, wanting to make
things different. Junk?!"
"Ancient history, Pop."
"Ancient?" Roger Bentley fixed his son with a terrible eye. "Christ.
When I was born in 1920, if you wanted to visit your family on Sundays
you-"
"Went to the graveyard?" said Rodney.
"Yes. My brother and sister died when I was seven. Half of my family
gone! Tell me, dear children, how many of your friends died while you
were growing up. In grammar school? High school?"
He included the family in his gaze, and waited.
"None," said Rodney at last.
"None! You hear that? None! Christ. Six of my best friends died by the
time I was ten! Wait! I just remembered!"
Roger Bentley hurried to rummage in a hall closet and brought out an old
78-rpm record into the sunlight, blowing off the dust. He squinted at
the label:
"No News, Or What Killed The Dog?"
Everyone came to look at the ancient disc.
"Hey, how old is that?"
"Heard it a hundred times when I was a kid in the twenties," said Roger.
"No News, Or What Killed The Dog?" Sal glanced at her father's face.
"This gets played at Dog's funeral," he said.
"You're not serious?" said Ruth Bentley.
Just then the doorbell rang.
"That can't be the Pet Cemetery people come to take Dog-?"
"No!" cried Susan. "Not so soon!"
Instinctively, the family formed a wall between Dog and the doorbell
sound, holding off eternity.
Then they cried, one more time.
The strange and wonderful thing about the funeral was how many people
came.
"I didn't know Dog had so many friends," Susan blubbered.
"He freeloaded all around town," said Rodney.
"Speak kindly of the dead."
"Well, he did, dammit., Otherwise why is Bill Johnson here, or Gert
Skall, or Jim across the street?"
"Dog," said Roger Bentley, "I sure wish you could see this."
"He does." Susan's eyes welled over. "Wherever he is."
"Good old Sue," whispered Rodney, "who cries at telephone books-"
"Shut up!" cried Susan.
"Hush, both of you."
And Roger Bentley moved, eyes down, toward the front of the small
funeral parlor where Dog was laid out, head on paws, in a box that was
neither too rich nor too simple but just right.
Roger Bentley placed a steel needle down on the black record which
turned on top of a flake-painted portable phonograph. The needle
scratched and hissed. All the neighbors leaned forward.
"No funeral oration," said Roger quickly. "Just this . . And a voice
spoke on a day long ago and told a story about a man who returned from
vacation to ask friends what had happened while he was gone.
It seemed that nothing whatsoever had happened. Oh, just one thing.
Everyone wondered what had killed the dog.
The dog? asked the vacationer. My dog died? Yes, and maybe it was the
burned horseflesh did it. Burned horseflesh!? cried the vacationer.
Well, said his informant, when the barn burned, the horseflesh caught
fire, so the dog ate the burned horseflesh, died.
The barn!? cried the vacationer. How did it catch fire? Well, sparks
from the house blew over, torched the barn, burned the horseflesh, dog
ate them, died.
Sparks from the house!? shouted the vacationer. How-?
It was the curtains in the house, caught fire.
Curtains? Burned!?
From the candles around the coffin.
Coffin!?
Your aunt's funeral coffin, candles there caught the curtains, house
burned, sparks from the house flew over, burned down the barn, dog ate
the burned horseflesh-In sum: no news, or what killed the dog!
The record hissed and stopped.
In the silence, there was a little quiet laughter, even though the
record had been about dogs and people dying.
"Now, do we get the lecture?" said Rodney.
"No, a sermon."
Roger Bentley put his hands on the pulpit to stare for long moments at
notes he hadn't made.
"I don't know if we're here for Dog or ourselves. Both, I suppose. We're
the nothing-ever-happened-to-us people. Today is a first. Not that I
want a rush of doom or disease. God forbid. Death, come slowly, please."
He turned the phonograph record round and round in his hands, trying to
read the words under the grooves.
"No news. Except the aunt's funeral candles catch the curtains, sparks
fly, and the dog goes west. In our lives, just the opposite. No news for
years. Good livers, healthy hearts, good times. So-what's it all about?"
Roger Bentley glanced at Rodney, who was checking his wristwatch.
"Someday we must die, also." Roger Bentley hurried on. "Hard to believe.
We're spoiled. But Susan was right. Dog died to tell us this, gently,
and we must believe. And at the same time celebrate. What? The fact that
we're the start of an amazing, dumbfounding history of survival that
will only get better as the centuries pass. You may argue that the next
war will take us all. Maybe.
"I can only say I think you will grow to be old, very old people. Ninety
years from now, most people will have cured hearts, stopped cancers, and
jumped life cycles. A lot of sadness will have gone out of the world,
thank God. Will this be easy to do? No. Will we do it? Yes. Not in all
countries, right off. But, finally, in most.
"As I said yesterday, fifty years ago, if you wanted to
visit your aunts, uncles, grandparents, brothers, sisters, the graveyard
was it. Death was all the talk. You had to talk it. Time's up, Rodney?"
Rodney signaled his father he had one last minute.
Roger Bentley wound it down:
"Sure, kids still die. But not millions. Old folks? Wind up in Sun City
instead of marble Orchard."
The father surveyed his family, bright-eyed, in the pews.
"God, look at you! Then look back. A thousand centuries of absolute
terror, absolute grief. How parents stayed sane to raise their kids when
half of them died, damned if I know. Yet with broken hearts, they did.
While millions died of flu or the Plague.
"So here we are in a new time that we can't see because we stand in the
eye of the hurricane, where everything's calm.
"I'll shut up now, with a last word for Dog. Because we loved him, we've
done this almost silly thing, this service, but now suddenly we're not
ashamed or sorry we bought him a plot or had me speak. We may never come
visit him, who can say? But he has a place. Dog, old boy, bless you.
Now, everyone, blow your nose."
Everyone blew his nose.
"Dad," said Rodney suddenly, "could-we hear the record again?"
Everyone looked at Rodney, surprised.
"Just," said Roger Bentley, "what I was going to suggest."
He put the needle on the record. It hissed.
About a minute in, when the sparks from the house flew over to burn the
barn and torch the horseflesh and kill the dog, there was a sound at the
back doorway to the small parlor.
Everyone turned.
A strange man stood in the door holding a small wicker basket from which
came familiar, small yapping sounds.
And even as the flames from the candles around the coffin caught the
curtains and the last sparks blew on the wind
The whole family, drawn out into the sunlight, gathered around the
stranger with the wicker basket, waiting for Father to arrive to throw
back the coverlet on the small carrier so they could all dip their hands
in.
That moment, as Susan said later, was like reading the telephone book
one more time.
THE WITCH DOOR
It was a pounding on a door, a furious, frantic, insistent pounding,
born of hysteria and fear and a great desire to be heard, to be freed,
to be let loose, to escape. It was a wrenching at hidden paneling, it
was a hollow knocking, a rapping, a testing, a clawing! It was a
scratching at hollow boards, a ripping at bedded nails; it was a muffled
closet shouting and demanding, far away, and a call to be noticed,
followed by a silence.
The silence was the most empty and terrible of all. Robert and Martha
Webb sat up in bed.
"Did you hear it?"
"Yes, again."
"Downstairs."
Now whoever it was who had pounded and rapped and made his fingers raw,
drawn blood with his fever and quest to be free, had drawn into silence,
listening himself to see if his terror and drumming had summoned any
help.
The winter night lay through the house with a falling-snow silence,
silence snowing into every room, drifting over tables and floors, and
banking up the stairwell.
Then the pounding started again. And then:
A sound of soft crying.
"Downstairs."
"Someone in the house."
"Lotte, do you think? The front door's unlocked."
"She'd have knocked. Can't be Lotte."
"She's the only one it could be. She phoned."
They both glanced at the phone. If you lifted the receiver, you heard a
winter stillness. The phones were dead. They had died days ago with the
riots in the nearest towns and cities. Now, in the receiver, you heard
only your own heart-beat. "Can you put me up?" Lone had cried from six
hundred miles away. "Just overnight?"
But before they could answer her, the phone had filled itself with long
miles of silence.
"Lotte is coming. She sounded hysterical. That might be her," said
Martha Webb.
"No,'' said Robert. "I heard that crying other nights, too. Dear God."
They lay in the cold room in this farmhouse back in the Massachusetts
wilderness, back from the main roads, away from the towns, near a bleak
river and a black forest. It was the frozen middle of December. The
white smell of snow cut the air.
They arose. With an oil lamp lit, they sat on the edge of the bed as if
dangling their legs over a precipice.
"There's no one downstairs, there can't be."
"Whoever it is sounds frightened."
"We're all frightened, damn it. That's why we came out here, to be away
from cities, riots, all that damned foolishness. No more wiretaps,
arrests, taxes, neurotics. Now when we find it at last, people call and
upset us. And tonight this, Christ!" He glanced at his wife. "You
afraid?"
"I don't know. I don't believe in ghosts. This is 1999; I'm sane. Or
like to think I am. Where's your gun?"
"We won't need it. Don't ask me why, but we won't." They picked up their
oil lamps. In another month the small power plant would be finished in
the white barns behind the house and there'd be power to spare, but now
they haunted the farm, coming and going with dim lamps or candles.
They stood at the stairwell, both thirty-three, both immensely
practical.
The crying, the sadness, and the plea came from below in the winter
rooms.
"She sounds so damned sad," said Robert. "God, I'm sorry for her, but
don't even know who it is. Come on."
They went downstairs.
As if hearing their footsteps, the crying grew louder. There was a dull
thudding against a hidden panel somewhere.
"The Witch Door!" said Martha Webb at last.
"Can't be."
"Is.”
  They stood in the long hall looking at that place under the stairs,
where the panels trembled faintly. But now the cries faded, as if the
crier was exhausted, or something had diverted her, or perhaps their
voices had startled her and she was listening for them to speak again.
Now the winter-night house was silent and the man and wife waited with
the oil lamps quietly fuming in their hands.
Robert Webb stepped to the Witch Door and touched it, probing for the
hidden button, the secret spring. "There can't be anyone in there," he
said. "My God, we've been here six months, and that's just a cubby.
Isn't that what the Realtor said when he sold the place? No one could
hide in there and us not know it. We-"
“Listen!”
They listened.
Nothing.
"She's gone, it's gone, whatever it was, hell, that door hasn't been
opened in our lifetime. Everyone’s forgotten where the spring is that
unlocks it. I don't think there is a door, only a loose panel, and rats'
nests, that's all. The walls, scratching. Why not?" He turned to look at
his wife, who was staring at the hidden place.
"Silly," she said. "Good Lord, rats don't cry. That was a voice, asking
to be saved. Lotte, I thought. But now I know it wasn't she, but someone
else in as much trouble."
Martha Webb reached out and trembled her fingertips along the beveled
edge of ancient maple. "Can't we open it?"
"With a crowbar and hammer, tomorrow."
"Oh, Robert!"
"Don't 'Oh, Robert' me. I'm tired."
"You can't leave her in there to-"
"She's quiet now. Christ, I'm exhausted. I'll come down at the crack of
dawn and knock the damned thing apart, okay?"
"All right," she said, and tears came to her eyes.
"Women," said Robert Webb. "Oh, my God, you and Lotte, Lotte and you. If
she is coming here, if she makes it, I'll have a houseful of lunatics!"
"Lotte's fine!"
"Sure, but she should keep her mouth shut. It doesn't pay now to say
you're Socialist, Democrat, Libertarian, Pro-Life Abortionist, Sinn Fein
Fascist, Commie, any damn thing. The towns are bombed out. People are
looking for scapegoats and Lotte has to shoot from the hip, get herself
smeared and now, hell, on the run."
"They'll jail her if they catch her. Or kill her, yes, kill her. We're
lucky to be here with our own food. Thank God we planned ahead, we saw
it coming, the starvation, the massacres. We helped ourselves. Now we
help Lone if she makes it through."
Without answering, he turned to the stairs. "I'm dead on my feet. I'm
tired of saving anyone. Even Lotte. But hell, if she comes through the
front door, she's saved."
They went up the stairs taking the lamps, advancing in an ever-moving
aura of trembling white glow. The house was as silent as snow falling.
"God," he whispered. "Damn, I don't like women crying like that."
It sounded like the whole world crying, he thought. The whole world
dying and needing help and lonely, but what can you do? Live in a farm
like this? Far off the main highway where people don't pass, away from
all the stupidity and death? What can you do?
They left one of the lamps lit and drew the covers over their bodies and
lay, listening to the wind hit the house and creak the beams and
parquetry.
A moment later there was a cry from downstairs, a splintering crash, the
sound of a door flung wide, a bursting out of air, footsteps rapping all
the rooms, a sobbing, almost an exultation, then the front door banged
open, the winter wind blowing wildly in, footsteps across the front
porch and gone.
"There!" cried Martha. "Yes!"
With the lamp they were down the stairs swiftly. Wind smothered their
faces as they turned now toward the Witch Door, opened wide, still on
its hinges, then toward the front door where they cast their light out
upon a snowing winter darkness and saw nothing but white and hills, no
moon, and in the lamplight the soft drift and moth-flicker of snowflakes
falling from the sky to the mattressed yard.
"Gone," she whispered.
"Who?"
"We'll never know, unless she comes back."
"She won't. Look."
They moved the lamplight toward the white earth and the tiny footprints
going off, across the softness, toward the dark forest.
"It was a woman, then. But . . . why?"
"God knows. Why anything, now in this crazy world?" They stood looking
at the footprints a long while until, shivering, they moved back through
the hall to the open Witch Door. They poked the lamp into this hollow
under the stairs.
"Lord, it's just a cell, hardly a closet, and look...”
 Inside stood a small rocking chair, a braided rug, a used candle in a
copper holder, and an old, worn Bible. The place smelled of must and
moss and dead flowers.
"Is this where they used to hide people?"
"Yes. A long time back they hid people called witches. Trials, witch
trials. They hung or burned some."
"Yes, yes," they both murmured, staring into the incredibly small cell.
"And the witches hid here while the hunters searched the house and gave
up and left?"
"Yes, oh, my God, yes," he whispered.
"Rob
''Yes?"
She bent forward. Her face was pale and she could not look away from the
small, worn rocking chair and the faded Bible.
"Rob. How old? This house, how old?"
"Maybe three hundred years.
"That old?"
"Why?"
"Crazy. Stupid . .
"Crazy?"
"Houses, old like this. All the years. And more years and more after
that. God, feel! If you put your hand in, yes? Would you feel it change,
silly, and what if I sat in that rocking chair and shut the
door, what? That woman . .. how long was she in there? How'd she get
there? From way, way back. Wouldn't it be strange?"
''Bull!''
"But if you wanted to run away badly enough, wished for it, prayed for
it, and people ran after you, and someone hid you in a place like this,
a witch behind a door, and heard the searchers run through the house,
closer and closer, wouldn't you want to get away? Anywhere? To another
place? Why not another time? And then, in a house like this, a house so
old nobody knows, if you wanted and asked for it enough, couldn't you
run to another year! Maybe"-she paused-"here . . . ?"
"No, no," he muttered. "Really stupid!"
But still, some quiet motion within the closeted space caused both, at
almost the same instant, to hold their hands out on the air, curious,
like people testing invisible waters. The air seemed to move one way and
then another, now warm, now cold, with a pulsation of light and a sudden
turning toward dark. All this they thought but could not say. There was
weather here, now a quick touch of summer and then a winter cold, which
could not be, of course, but there it was. Passing along their
fingertips, but unseen by their eyes, a stream of shadows and sun ran as
invisible as time itself, clear as crystal, but clouded by a shifting
dark. Both felt if they thrust their hands deep, they might be drawn in
to drown in a mighty storm of seasons within an incredibly small space.
All this, too, they thought or almost felt but could not say.
They seized their frozen but sunburned hands back, to stare down and
hold them against the panic in their breasts.
"Damn," whispered Robert Webb. "Oh, damn!" He backed off and went to
open the front door again and look at the snowing night where the
footprints had almost vanished.
"No" he said. "No, no."
Just then the yellow flash of headlights on the road braked in front of
the house.
"Lotte!" cried Martha Webb. "It must be! Lotte!" The car lights went
out. They ran to meet the running woman half up the front yard.
"Lotte!"
The woman, wild-eyed, hair windblown, threw herself at them.
"Martha, Bob! God, I thought I'd never find you! Lost! I'm being
followed, let's get inside. Oh, I didn't mean to get you up in the
middle of the night, it's good to see you! Jesus! Hide the car! Here are
the keys!"
Robert Webb ran to drive the car behind the house. When he came back
around he saw that the heavy snowfall was already covering the tracks.
Then the three of them were inside the house, talking, holding onto each
other. Robert Webb kept glancing at the front door.
"I can't thank you," cried Lotte, huddled in a chair. "You're at risk! I
won't stay long, a few hours until it's safe. Then ..
"Stay as long as you want."
"No. They'll follow! In the cities, the fires, the murders, everyone
starving, I stole gas. Do you have more? Enough to get me to Phil
Merdith's in Greenborough? I-"
"Lotte," said Robert Webb.
"Yes?" Lotte stopped, breathless.
"Did you see anyone on your way up here? A woman? Running on the road?"
"What? I drove so fast! A woman? Yes! I almost hit her. Then she was
gone! Why?"
''Well . .
"She's not dangerous?"
"No, no."
"It is all right, my being here?"
"Yes, fine, fine. Sit back. We'll fix some coffee-"
"Wait! I'll check!" And before they could stop her, Lotte ran to the
front door, opened it a crack, and peered out. They stood with her and
saw distant headlights flourished over a low hill and gone into a
valley. "They're coming," whispered Lotte. "They might search here. God,
where can I hide?"
Martha and Robert glanced at each other.
No, no, thought Robert Webb. God, no! Preposterous, unimaginable,
fantastic, so damned coincidental the mind raves at it, crows, hoots,
guffaws! No, none of this! Get oft' circumstance! Get away with your
goings and comings on not neat, or too neat, schedules. Come back,
Lotte, in ten years, five years, maybe a year, a month, a week, and ask
to hide. Even tomorrow show up! But don't come with coincidence in each
hand like idiot children and ask, only half an hour after one terror,
one miracle, to test our disbelief! I'm not, after all, Charles Dickens,
to blink and let this pass.
"What's wrong?" said Lotte.
"I-" said Robert.
"No place to hide me?"
"Yes," he said. "We've a place."
"Well?"
"Here." He turned slowly away, stunned.
They walked down the hall to the half-open paneling.
"This?" Lotte said. "Secret? Did you-7"
"No' it's been here since the house was built long ago." Lotte touched
and moved the door on its hinges. "Does it work? Will they know where to
look and find it?"
"No. It's beautifully made. Shut, you can't tell it's there." Outside in
the winter night, cars rushed, their beams flashing up the road, across
the house windows.
Lotte peered into the Witch Door as one peers down a deep, lonely well.
A filtering of dust moved about her. The small rocking chair trembled.
Moving in silently, Lotte touched the half-burned candle.
"Why, it's still warm!"
Martha and Robert said nothing. They held to the Witch Door, smelling
the odor of warm tallow.
Lotte stood rigidly in the little space, bowing her head beneath the
beamed ceiling.
A horn blew in the snowing night. Lotte took a deep breath and said,
"Shut the door."
They shut the Witch Door. There was no way to tell that a door was
there.
They blew out the lamp and stood in the cold, dark house, waiting.
The cars rushed down the road, their noise loud, and their yellow
headlights bright in the falling snow. The wind stirred the footprints
in the yard, one pair going out, another coming in, and the tracks of
Lotte's car fast vanishing, and at last gone.
"Thank God," whispered Martha.
The cars, honking, whipped around the last bend and down the hill and
stopped, waiting, looking in at the dark house. Then, at last, they
started up away into the snow and the hills.
Soon their lights were gone and their sound gone with them.
"We were lucky," said Robert Webb.
"But she's not."
"She?''
"That woman, whoever she was, ran out of here. They'll find
here. Somebody'll find her."
"Christ, that's right."
"And she has no I.D., no proof of herself. And she doesn't know
what's happened to her. And when she tells them who she is and where
she came from!"
"Yes, yes."
"God help her."
They looked into the snowing night but saw nothing. Everything was
still. "You can't escape," she said. "No matter what you do, no one can
escape."
They moved away from the window and down the hall to the Witch Door and
touched it.
"Lotte," they called.
The Witch Door did not tremble or move. "Lotte, you can come out now."
There was no answer; not a breath or a whisper. Robert tapped the door.
"Hey in there." "Lotte!"
He knocked at the paneling, his mouth agitated. "Lotte!"
"Open it!"
"I'm trying, damn it!"
"Lotte, we'll get you out, wait! Everything's all right!"
He beat with both fists, cursing. Then he said, "Watch
out!" took a step back, raised his leg, kicked once, twice, three times;
vicious kicks at the paneling that crunched holes and crumbled wood into
kindling. He reached in and yanked the entire paneling free. "Lotte!"
They leaned together into the small place under the stairs. The candle
flickered on the small table. The Bible was
gone. The small rocking chair moved quietly back and forth, in little
arcs, and then stood still.
"Lotte!"
They stared at the empty room. The candle flickered.
"Lotte," they said.
"You don't believe .
"I don't know. Old houses are old. . . old . .
"You think Lotte . . . she ...  ?"
"I don't know, I don't know."
"Then she's safe at least, safe! Thank God!"
"Safe? Where's she gone? You really think that? A woman in new clothes,
red lipstick, high heels, short skirt, perfume, plucked brows, diamond
rings, silk stockings, safe? Safe!" he said, staring deep into the open
frame of the Witch Door.
"Yes, safe. Why not?"
He drew a deep breath.
"A woman of that description, lost in a town called Salem in the year
1680?"
He reached over and shut the Witch Door.
They sat waiting by it for the rest of the long, cold night.
THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE
The talk in the village in the year 1853 was, of course, about the
madman above, in his sod-and-brick hut, with an untended garden and a
wife who had fled, silent about his madness, never to return.
The people of the village had never drunk enough courage to go see what
the special madness was or why the wife had vanished, tear-stained,
leaving a vacuum into which atmospheres had rushed to thunder-clap.
And yet ...
On a sweltering hot day with no cloud to offer shadow comfort and no
threat of rain to cool man or beast, the Searcher arrived. Which is to
say, Dr. Mortimer Goff, a man of many parts, most of them curious and
self-serving, but also traveling the world for some baroque event, or
miraculous revelation.
The good doctor came tramping up the hill, stumbling over cobbles that
were more stone than paving, having abandoned his coach-and-horses,
fearful of crippling them with such a climb.
Dr. Goff it turned out, had come from London, inhaling fogs, bombarded
by storms, and now, stunned by too much light and heat, this good if
curious physician stopped, exhausted, to lean against a fence, sight
further up the hill, and ask:
“Is this the way to the lunatic?”
A farmer who was more scarecrow than human raised his eyebrows and
snorted, "That would be Elijah Wetherby."
''If lunatics have names, yes."
"We call him crazed or mad, but lunatic will do. It sounds like book
learning. Are you one of those?"
"I own books, yes, and chemical retorts and a skeleton that was once a
man, and a permanent pass to the London Historical and Scientific
Museum-"
"All well and good," the farmer interrupted, "but of no use for failed
crops and a dead wife. Follow your nose. And when you find the fool or
whatever you name him, take him with you. We're tired of his shouts and
commotions late nights in his iron foundry and anvil menagerie. Rumor
says he will soon finish some monster that will run to kill us all."
"Is that true?" asked Dr. Goff.
"No, it lies easy on my tongue. Good day, Doctor, and God deliver you
from the lightning bolts that wait for you above."
With this the farmer spaded the earth to bury the conversation.
So the curious doctor, threatened, climbed on, under a dark cloud which
did not stop the sun.
And at last arrived at a hut that seemed more tomb than home, surrounded
by land more graveyard than garden.
Outside the ramshackle sod-and-brick dwelling a shadow stepped forth, as
if waiting, and became an old, very old, man.
"Well, there you are at last!" it cried.
Dr. Goff reared back at this. "You sound, sir, as if you expected me!"
"I did," said the old man, "some years ago! What took you so long?"
"You are not exactly cheek by jowl with London, sir."
"I am not," the old man agreed and added, "The name is Wetherby.
The Inventor"
"Mr. Wetherby, the Inventor. I am Dr. Goff, the so-called Searcher, for
I move in behalf of our good Queen, turning rocks, digging truffles,
curious for stuffs that might delight her Majesty or fill her museums,
shops, and streets in the greatest city in the world. Have I reached the
right place?"
"And just in time, for I am now in my eightieth year and of
inconsequential vigor. If you had arrived next year, you might have
found me in the churchyard. Do come in!"
At this moment, Dr. Goff heard a gathering of people behind him, all
with a most unpleasant muttering, so at Mr. Wetherby's beckoning, he was
glad to enter, sit, and watch an almost rare whiskey being poured
without invitation. When he had quaffed the glass, Dr. Goff swiveled his
gaze about the room.
"Well, where is it?"
"Where is what, sir?"
"The lunatic device, the insane machine that goes nowhere but in going
might run down a child, a lamb, a priest, a nun, or an old blind
dog, where?"
"So I am that famous, am I?" The old man let a few crumbs of laughter
fall from his toothless mouth. "Well, sir. I keep it locked in the
goats' shed behind: the outhouse of machines. Finish that to strengthen
your sanity when you at last behold the delight and grievance of my long
inventive life. So!"
The doctor drank, was replenished and soon out the door, across a small,
smooth circle of turf, and to a shed whose door was triple-kept with
numerous padlocks and keys. Old Wetherby entered, lit many candles, and
beckoned the good doctor in.
He pointed as to a manger. The medical Searcher looked, expecting a
mother, crib, and holy babe by the way Wetherby gestured and cried:
"There she be!"
"Is it female, then?"
"Come to think, she is!"
And there in the candlelight was Wetherby's mechanical pride.
Dr. Goff coughed, to hide his chagrin.
"That, sir, is but a metal frame!"
"But what a frame to hold velocities! Ha!"
And the old man, young with fevers, rushed to seize a largish wheel
which he transported to fit to the front part of the frame. Then he
fetched yet another circular object to fit into the frame's rear.
"Well?" he cried.
"I see two wheels, half  a cart, and no horse!"
"We will shoot all horses!" exclaimed Wetherby. "My invention, by the
tens of thousands, will shy off all horses and banish manures. Do you
know, each day in London a thousand tons of horse clods must be cleared,
fertilizer wasted, not spread on neighbor fields but dumped as sludge
down-Thames. God, how I talk!"
"But, sir, continue. Those look to be spinning wheels, borrowed from
nearby farms?"
"They are, but spliced and strengthened with metal to sustain“ -
Wetherby touched himself - “one hundred twenty pounds. And here's the
saddle for that weight." Whereupon he fitted a saddle mid-frame. "And
here the stirrups and ribbon to run the back wheel." So saying, he
affixed a longish leather ribbon to one stirrup's rotary and tightened
it on a spool at the rear.
"Do you begin to perceive, Doctor?"
"I am stranded in ignorance, sir.
"Well, then, be alert, for I now enthrone myself."
And the old man, light as a chimpanzee, slung himself in place on a
leather seat mid-frame between the silent spinning wheels.
"I still see no horse, sir."
"I am the horse, Doctor. I am the horse a-gallop!"
And the old man thrust his feet in the stirrups to chum them up, around,
and down; up, around, and down; as the rear wheels, provoked, did
likewise, up, down, around, with a lovely hum, fastened in place on the
platform planks.
"Aha." The doctor's face brightened. "This is a device to manufacture
electrical power? Something from Benjamin Franklin's storm-lightning
notebooks?!"
"Gods, no. It could make lightnings, yes! But this, sir, not seeming
one, is a horse, and I its night rider! So!"
And Wetherby pumped and wheezed, wheezed and pumped, and the rear
wheels, locked in place, spun faster, faster, with a siren whine.
"All very well," snorted the good doctor, "but the horse, if it is, and
the rider, if you are, seem to be going nowhere! What will you call your
machine?"
"I have had many nights and years to think." Wetherby pumped and
wheezed. "The Velocitor, perhaps." Pumpwheeze. "Or the Precipitor, but
no, that sounds as if I might be thrown from my 'horse.' The Galvanizer,
yes? Or why not-" Wheeze-pump. "The Landstride or Diminisher, for-"
Wheeze-pump. "It does diminish time and distance. Doctor, you know
Latin, eh? So, feet to wheel, wheel run by feet name it!''
"The Elijah, your given name, sir, the Elijah."
“But he saw a wheel way in the middle of the air and it was a wheel in a
wheel, is that not so?”
"When last I was in church, yes. And you are grounded, that is plain to
see. Why not Velocipede, then? Having to do with speed and the applied
toe and ankle?"
"Close-on, Dr. Goff, close-on. Why do you stare so fixedly?"
"It comes to mind that great times call forth great inventions. The
inventor is child to his year and day. This is not a great time for such
as you and yours. Did this century call you forth as its mightiest of
all men of genius?"
Old Wetherby let his machine coast for a moment and smiled.
"No, I and my Tilda here, I call her Tilda, will instead be the gravity
that calls forth the century. We will influence the year, the decade,
and the millennium!"
"It is hard for me to believe," said the medical gentleman, "that you
will build a road from your sill to the city on which to glide your
not-inconsiderable dream."
"Nay, Doctor, the reverse is true. The city, and the world when they
know me1 and this will run a concourse here to deliver me to fame."
"Your head knocks heaven, Mr. Wetherby," said the doctor dryly. "But
your roots ache for sustenance, water, minerals, air. You stroke and
pump wildly, but go nowhere. Once off that rack, will you not fall on
your side, destroyed?"
"Nay, nay." Wetherby, in gusts, pumped again. "For I have discovered
some physics, as yet nameless. The faster you propel this bodily device,
the less tendency to fall left or right but continue straight, if no
obstacles prevent!"
"With only two wheels beneath? Prove it. Release your invention, set it
free in flight, let us see you sustain your forward motion without
breaking your bum!"
"Oh, God, shut up!" cried Wetherby as his kindling legs thrashed the
pedals, racketing round as he leaned into a phantom wind, eyes clenched
against an invisible storm, and churned the wheels to a frenzy. "Don't
you hear? Listen. That whine, that cry, that whisper. The ghost in the
machine, which promises things most new, unseen, unrealized, only a
dream now but tomorrow - Great God, don't you see?! If I were on
a real path this would be swifter than gazelles, a panic of deer! All
pedestrians vanquished. All coach-and-horses in dust! Not twenty miles a
day, but thirty, forty miles in a single glorious hour! Stand off, Time.
Beware, meadow-beasts! Here glides, in full plummet, Wetherby
with nothing to stop him!"
"Aye," said the Searcher dryly, "you pump up a storm on that stand. But,
set free, how would you balance on only two wheels!?”
"Like this!" cried Wetherby, and with a thrust of his hands and an
uplift of frame, seized the Traveler, the Motion Machine, the
Pathfinder, up free of its stand and in an instant plunged through the
room and out the door, with Dr. Goff, in full pursuit, yelling:
"Stop! You'll kill yourself!"
"No, exhilarate my heart, oxygenate my blood!" cried Wetherby, and there
he was in a chicken-yard he had trampled flat, paths some sixty feet
around on which he now flailed his metal machine with scythings of
ankle, toe, heel, and leg, sucking air, gusting out great laughs. "See?
I do not fall! Two legs, two wheels, and: presto!"
"My God!" cried Dr. Goff, eyes thrust forth like hardboiled eggs. "God's
truth! How so?!"
"I fly forward faster than I fall downward, an unguessed law of physics.
But lo! I almost fly. Fly! Good-bye horses, doomed and dead!"
And with "dead" he was overcome with such a delirium of pant and pump,
perspiration raining off him in showers, that with a great cry, he
wobbled and was flung, a meteor of flesh, over and down on a coop where
the chickens, in dumb feather-duster alarms, exploded in shrieks as
Wetherby slid in one direction while his vehicle, self-motivated, wheels
a-spin, mounted Dr. Goff, who jumped aside, fearful of being spliced.
Wetherby, helped to his feet, protested his trajectory:
"Ignore that! Do you at last understand?"
"Fractures, wounds, broken skulls, yes!"
"No, a future brave with motion, 'tween my legs. You have come a long
way, Doctor. Will you adopt and further my machine?"
"Well," said the doctor, already out of the yard, into the house, and to
the front door, his face confused, his wits a patch of nettles. "Ah," he
said.
"Say you will, Doctor. Or my device dies, and I with it!"
"But.. ." said the doctor and opened the outer door, only to draw back,
alarmed. "What have I done!" he cried.
Peering over his shoulder, Wetherby expressed further alarm. "Your
presence is known, Doctor; the word has spread. A lunatic has come to
visit a lunatic."
And it was true. On the road and in the front garden yard were some
twelve or twenty farmers and villagers, some with rocks, some with
clubs, and with looks of malice or outright hostility caught in their
eyes and mouths.
"There they are!" someone cried.
"Have you come to take him away?" someone else shouted.
"Yah" echoed the struggling crowd, moving forward.
Thinking quickly, Dr. Goff replied, "Yes. I will take him away!" And
turned back to the old man.
"Take me where, Doctor?" whispered Wetherby, clutching his elbow.
"One moment!" cried the doctor to the crowd, which then subsided in
murmurs. "Let me think."
Standing back, cudgeling his bald spot, and then massaging his brow for
rampant inspiration, Dr. Goff at last exhaled in triumph.
"I have it, by George. A genius of an idea, which will please both
villagers, to be rid of you, and you, to be rid of them."
"What, what, Doctor?"
"Why, sir, you are to come down to London under cover of night and I
will let you through the side door of my museum with your blasphemous
toy of Satan .
"To what purpose?"
"Purpose? Why, sir, I have found the path, the smooth surface, the road
you spoke of at some future time!"
"The road, the path, the surface?"
"The museum floors, marble, smooth, lovely, wondrous, ohmigod, for all
your needs!"
"Needs?"
"Don't be thick. Each night, as many nights as you wish, to your heart's
content, you can ride that wheeled demon round and round, past the
Rembrandts and Turners and Fra Angelicos, through the Grecian statues
and Roman busts, careful of porcelains, minding the crystals, but
pumping away like Lucifer all night till dawn!"
"Oh, dear God," murmured Wetherby, "why didn't I think?"
"If you had you would've been too shy to ask!"
"The only place in the world with roads like future roads, paths like
tomorrow's paths, boulevards without cobbles, pure as Aphrodite's
cheeks! Smooth as Apollo's rump!"
And here Wetherby unlocked his eyes to let fall tears, pent up for
months and long hilltop years.
"Don't cry," said Dr. Goff.
"I must, with joy, or burst. Do you mean it?"
"My good man, here's my hand!"
They shook and the shaking let free at least one drop of rain from the
good doctor's cheek, also.
"The excitement will kill me," said Wetherby, wiping the backs of his
fists across his eyes.
"No better way to die! Tomorrow night?"
"But what will people say as I lead my machine through the streets to
your museum?"
"If anyone sees, say you're a gypsy who's stolen treasure from a distant
year. Well, well, Elijah Wetherby, I'm off."
"Be careful downhill."
"Careful."
Half out the door, Dr. Goff tripped on a cobble and almost fell as a
farmer said:
"Did you see the lunatic?"
"I did."
"Will you take him to a madhouse?"
"Yes. Asylum." Dr. Goff adjusted his cuffs. "Crazed. Worthless. You will
see him no more!"
"Good!" said all as he passed.
"Grand," said Goff and picked his way down the stone path, listening.
And uphill was there not a final, joyful, wheel-circling cry from that
distant yard?
Dr. Goff snorted.
"Think on it," he said, half aloud, "no more horses, no
more manure! Think!"
And, thinking, fell on the cobbles, lurching toward London and the
future.
AT THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR
”Well,” said Sheila, chewing on her breakfast toast and examining her
complexion, distorted in the side of the coffee urn, "here it is the
last day of the last month of the ninth year."
Her husband, Thomas, glanced over the rampart of The Wall Street
Journa4 saw nothing to fasten his regard, and sank back in place.
"What?"
"I said," said Sheila, "the ninth year's finished and you have a
completely new wife. Or, to put it properly, the old wife's gone. So I
don't think we're married anymore."
Thomas floored the Journal on his as-yet-untouched scrambled eggs,
tilted his head this way and that, and said:
"Not married?"
"No, that was another time, another body, another me." She buttered more
toast and munched on it philosophically.
"Hold on!" He took a stiff jolt of coffee. "Explain."
"Well, dear Thomas, don't you remember reading as children and later,
that every nine years, I think it was nine, the body, churning like a
gene-chromosome factory, did your entire person over, fingernails,
spleen, ankles to elbows, belly, bum, and earlobes, molecule by
molecule-"
"Oh, get to it," he grumbled. "The point, wife, the point!"
"The point, dear Tom," she replied, finishing her toast, "is that with
this breakfast I have replenished my soul and psyche, completed the
reworking of my entire flesh, blood, and bones. This person seated
across from you is not the woman you married-"
"I have often said that!"
"Be serious."
"Are you?" he said.
"Let me finish. If the medical research is true, then at the end of nine
years there is not an eyebrow, eyelash, pore, dimple, or skin follicle
in this creature here at this celebratory breakfast that in any way is
related to that old Sheila Tompkins married at eleven a.m. of a Saturday
nine years ago this very hour. Two different women. One in bondage to a
nice male creature whose jaw jumps out like a cash register when he
scans the Journal. The other, now that it is one minute after the
deadline hour, Born Free. So!"
She rose swiftly and prepared to flee.
"Wait!" He gave himself another jolt of coffee. "Where are you going?"
Hallway to the door, she said, "Out. Perhaps away. And who knows:
forever!"
"Born free? Hogwash. Come here! Sit down!"
She hesitated as he assumed his lion-tamer's voice. "Dammit. You owe me
an explanation. Sit!"
She turned slowly. "For only as long as it takes to draw a picture."
"Draw it, then. Sit!"
She came to stare at her plate. "I seem to have eaten everything in
sight."
He jumped up, ran over to the side table, rummaged more omelet, and
banged it in front of her.
"There.! Speak with your mouth full."
She forked in the eggs. "You do see what I'm driving at, don't you,
Tomasino?"
"Damnation! I thought you were happy!"
"Yes, but not incredibly happy."
"That's for maniacs on their honeymoons!"
"Yes, wasn't it?" she remembered.
"That was then, this is now. Well?"
"I could feel it happening all year. Lying in bed, I felt my skin
prickle, my pores open like ten thousand tiny mouths, my perspiration
run like faucets, my heart race, my pulse sound in the oddest places,
under my chin, my wrists, the backs of my knees, my ankles. I felt like
a huge wax statue, melting. After midnight I was afraid to turn on the
bathroom light and find a stranger gone mad in the mirror."
"All right, all right!" He stirred four sugars in his coffee and drank
the slops from the saucer. "Sum it up!"
"Every hour of every night and then all day, I could feel it as if I
were out in a storm being struck by hot August rain that washed away the
old to find a brand-new me. Every drop of serum, every red and white
corpuscle, every hot flash of nerve ending, rewired and restrung, new
marrow, new hair for combing, new fingerprints even. Don't look at me
that way. Perhaps no new fingerprints. But all the rest. See? Am I not a
fresh-sculpted, fresh-painted work of God's creation?"
He searched her up and down with a razor glare.
"I hear Mad Carlotta maundering," he said. "I see a woman
hyperventilated by a midlife frenzy. Why don't you just say it? Do you
want a divorce?"
"Not necessarily."
"Not necessarily?" he shouted.
"I'll just simply . . . go away."
"Where will you go?"
"There must be some place," she said vaguely, stirring her omelet to
make paths.
"Is there another man?" he said at last, holding his utensils with
fists.
"Not quite yet.
"Thank God for small favors." He let a great breath gust out. "Now go to
your room."
"Beg pardon?" She blinked.
"You'll not be allowed out for the rest of this week. Go to your room.
No phone calls. No TV. No-"
She was on her feet. "You sound like my father in high school!"
"I'll be damned." He laughed quietly. "Yes! Upstairs now! No lunch for
you, my girl. I'll put a plate by your door at suppertime. When you
behave I'll give you your car keys. Meanwhile, march! Pull out your
telephone plugs and hand over your CD player!"
"This is outrageous," she cried. "I'm a grown woman."
"Ingrown. No progress. Re-gress. If that damn theory's true, you didn't
add on, just sank back nine years! Out you
go! Up!”
She ran, pale-faced, to the entry stairs, wiping tears from her eyes.
As she was hallway up, he, putting his foot on the first step, pulled
the napkin from his shirt and called quietly, "Wait ...”
She froze in place but did not look back down at him, waiting.
"Sheila," he said at last, tears running down his cheeks now.
"Yes," she whispered.
"I love you," he said.
"I know," she said. "But it doesn't help."
"Yes, it does. Listen."
She waited, hallway up to her room.
He rubbed his hand over his face as if trying to massage some truth out
of it. His hand was almost frantic, searching for something hidden
around his mouth or near his eyes.
Then it almost burst from him. "Sheila!"
"I'm supposed to go to my room," she said.
"Don't!"
"What, then?"
His face began to relax, his eyes to fix on a solution, as his hand
rested on the banister leading up to where she stood with her back
turned.
"If what you say is true-"
"It is," she murmured. "Every cell, every pore, every eyelash. Nine
years-"
"Yes, yes, I know, yes. But listen."
He swallowed hard and that helped him digest the solution which he now
spoke very weakly, then quietly, and then with a kind of growing
certainty.
"If what you say happened-"
"It did," she murmured, head down.
"Well, then," he said slowly, and then, "It happened to me, too."
"What?" Her head lifted a trifle.
"It doesn't just happen to one person, right? It happens to all people,
everyone in the world. And if that's true, well, my body has been
changing along with yours during all the last nine years. Every
follicle, every fingernail, all the dermis and epidermis or whatever. I
never noticed. But it must have."
Her head was up now and her back was not slumped. He hurried on.
"And if that's true, good Lord, then I'm new, too. The old Tom, Thomas,
Tommy, Tomasino is left behind back there with the shed snakeskin."
Her eyes opened and she listened and he finished. "So we're both
brand-new. You're the new, beautiful woman I've been thinking about
finding and loving in the last year. And I'm that man you were heading
out to search for. Isn't that right? Isn't that true?"
There was the merest hesitation and then she gave the smallest, almost
imperceptible nod.
"Mercy," he called gently.
"That's not my name," she said.
"It is now. New woman, new body, new name. So I picked one for you.
Mercy?"
After a moment she said, "What does that make you?"
"Let me think." He chewed his lip and smiled. "How about Frank? Frankly,
my dear, I do give a damn."
"Frank," she murmured. "Frank and Mercy. Mercy and Frank."
"It doesn't exactly ring, but it'll do. Mercy?"
"Yes?"
"Will you marry me?"
    "What?''
"I said, will you marry me. Today. An hour from now. Noon?"
She turned at last to look down at him with a face all freshly tanned
and washed.
"Oh, yes," she said.
"And we'll run away and be maniacs again, for a little while
"No," she said, "here is fine. Here is wonderful."
"Come down, then," he said, holding his hand up to her. "We have another
nine years before another change. Come down and finish your wedding
breakfast. Mercy?"
She came down the steps and took his hand and smiled.
"Where's the champagne?" she said.
BUG
Looking back now, I can't remember a time when Bug wasn't dancing. Bug
is short for jitterbug and, of course, those were the days in the late
thirties, our final days in high school and our first days out in the
vast world looking for work that didn't exist when jitterbugging was all
the rage. And I can remember Bug (his real name was Bert Bagley, which
shortens to Bug nicely), during a jazz-band blast at our final aud-call
for our high school senior class, suddenly leaping up to dance with an
invisible partner in the middle of the front aisle of the auditorium.
That brought the house down. You never heard such a roar or such
applause. The bandleader, stricken with Bug's oblivious joy, gave an
encore and Bug did the same and we all exploded. After that the band
played "Thanks for the Memory" and we all sang it, with tears pouring
down our cheeks. Nobody in all the years after could forget: Bug dancing
in the aisle, eyes shut, hands out to grasp his invisible girlfriend,
his legs not connected to his body, just his heart, all over the place.
When it was over, nobody, not even the band, wanted to leave. We just
stood there in the world Bug had made, hating to go out into that other
world that was waiting for us.
It was about a year later when Bug saw me on the street and stopped his
roadster and said come on along to my place for a hot dog and a Coke,
and I jumped in and we drove over with the top down and the wind really
hitting us and Bug talking and talking at the top of his lungs, about
life and the times and what he wanted to show me in his front
parlor-front parlor, hell, dining room, kitchen, and bedroom.
What was it he wanted me to see?
Trophies. Big ones, little ones, solid gold and silver and brass
trophies with his name on them. Dance trophies. I mean they were
everywhere, on the floor by his bed, on the kitchen sink, in the
bathroom, but in the parlor, especially, they had settled like a locust
plague. There were so many of them on the mantel, and in bookcases
instead of books, and on the floor, you had to wade through, kicking
some over as you went. They totaled, he said, tilting his head back and
counting inside his eyelids, to about three hundred and twenty prizes,
which means grabbing onto a trophy almost every night in the past year.
"All this," I gasped, "just since we left high school?"
"Ain't I the cat's pajamas?" Bug cried.
"You're the whole darned department store! Who was your partner, all
those nights?"
"Not partner, partners," Bug corrected. "Three hundred, give or take a
dozen, different women on three hundred different nights."
“Where do you find three hundred women, all talented, all good enough,
to win prizes?”
"They weren't talented or all good," said Bug, glancing around at his
collection. "They were just ordinary, good, every-night dancers. I won
the prizes. I made them good. And when we got Out there dancing, we
cleared the floor.
Everyone else stopped, to watch us there out in the middle of nowhere,
and we never stopped."
He paused, blushed, and shook his head. "Sorry about that. Didn't mean
to brag."
But he wasn't bragging. I could see. He was just telling the truth.
"You want to know how this all started?" said Bug, handing over a hot
dog and a Coke.
"Don't tell me," I said. "I know."
"How could you?" said Bug, looking me over.
"The last aud-call at L.A. High, I think they played 'Thanks for the
Memory,' but just before that-"
" 'Roll Out the Barrel'-"
"-'the Barrel,' yes, and there you were in front of God and everyone,
jumping."
"I never stopped," said Bug, eyes shut, back in those
years. "Never," he said, "stopped."
"You got your life all made," I said.
"Unless," said Bug, "something happens."
What happened was, of course, the war.
Looking back, I remember that in that last year in school, sap that I
was, I made up a list of my one hundred and sixty-five best friends. Can
you imagine that? One hundred and sixty-five, count 'em,
best friends! It's a good thing I never showed that list to anyone. I
would have been hooted out of school.
    Anyway, the war came and went and took with it a couple dozen of
those listed friends and the rest just disappeared into holes in the
ground or went east or wound up in Malibu or Fort Lauderdale. Bug was on
that list, but I didn't figure out I didn't really knowhim until half a
lifetime later. By that time I was down to half a dozen pals or women I
might turn to if I needed, and it was then, walking down Hollywood
Boulevard one Saturday afternoon, I heard someone call:
"How about a hot dog and a Coke?"
Bug, I thought without turning. And that's who it was, standing on the
Walk of Stars with his feet planted on Mary Pickford and Ricardo Cortez
just behind and Jimmy Stewart just ahead. Bug had taken off some hair
and put on some weight, but it was Bug and I was overjoyed, perhaps too
much, and showed it, for he seemed embarrassed at my enthusiasm. I saw
then that his suit was not half new enough and his shirt frayed, but his
tie was neatly tied and he shook my hand off and we popped into a place
where we stood and had that hot dog and that Coke.
"Still going to be the world's greatest writer?" said Bug.
"Working at it," I said.
"You'll get there," said Bug and smiled, meaning it. "You were always
good."
"So were you," I said.
That seemed to pain him slightly, for he stopped chewing for a moment
and took a swig of Coke. "Yes, sir," he said. "I surely was."
"God," I said, "I can still remember the day I saw all those trophies
for the first time. What a family! Whatever-?"
Before I could finish asking, he gave the answer.
"Put 'em in storage, some. Some wound up with my first wife. Goodwill
got the rest."
"I'm sorry," I said, and truly was.
Bug looked at me steadily. "How come you're sorry?"
"Hell, I dunno," I said. "It's just, they seemed such a part of you. I
haven't thought of you often the last few years or so, to be honest, but
when I do, there you are knee-deep in all those cups and mugs in your
front room, out in the kitchen, hell, in your garage!"
"I'll be damned," said Bug. "What a memory you got."
We finished our Cokes and it was almost time to go. I couldn't help
myself, even seeing that Bug had fleshed himself out over the years.
"When-" I started to say, and stopped.
"When what?" said Bug.
"When," I said with difficulty, "when was the last time you danced?"
"Years," said Bug.
"But how long ago?"
"Ten years. Fifteen. Maybe twenty. Yeah, twenty. I don't dance anymore."
"I don't believe that. Bug not dance? Nuts."
"Truth. Gave my fancy night-out shoes to the Goodwill, too. Can't dance
in your socks."
"Can, and barefoot, too!"
Bug had to laugh at that. “You're really something. Well, it's been
nice.” He started edging toward the door. "Take care, genius-"
"Not so fast." I walked him out into the light and he was looking both
ways as if there were heavy traffic. "You know one thing I never saw and
wanted to see? You bragged about it, said you took three hundred
ordinary girls out on the dance floor and turned them into Ginger Rogers
inside three minutes. But I only saw you once at that aud-call in '38,
so I don't believe you."
"What?" said Bug. "You saw the trophies!"
"You could have had those made up," I pursued, looking at his wrinkled
suit and frayed shirt cuffs. "Anyone can go in a trophy shop and buy a
cup and have his name put on it!"
"You think I did that?" cried Bug.
"I think that, yes!"
Bug glanced out in the street and back at me and back in the street and
back to me, trying to decide which way to run or push or shout.
"What's got into you?" said Bug. "Why're you talking like that?"
"God, I don't know," I admitted. "It's just, we might not meet again and
I'll never have the chance, or you to prove it. I'd like, after all this
time, to see what you talked about. I'd love to see you dance again,
Bug."
"Naw," said Bug. "I've forgotten how."
"Don't hand me that. You may have forgotten, but the rest of you knows
how. Bet you could go down to the Ambassador Hotel this afternoon, they
still have tea dances there, and clear the floor, just like you said.
After you're out there nobody else dances, they all stop and look at you
and her just like thirty years ago."
"No," said Bug, backing away but coming back. "No, no."
"Pick a stranger, any girl, any woman, out of the crowd, lead her out,
hold her in your arms and just skim her around as if you were on ice and
dream her to Paradise."
"If you write like that, you'll never sell," said Bug.
"Bet you, Bug."
"I don't bet."
"All right, then. Bet you you can't. Bet you, By God, that you've lost
your stuff!"
"Now, hold on," said Bug.
"I mean it. Lost your stuff forever, for good. Bet you. Wanna bet?"
Bug's eyes took on a peculiar shine and his face was flushed. "How
much?"
"Fifty bucks!"
"I don't have-"
"Thirty bucks, then. Twenty! You can afford to lose that, can't you?"
"Who says I'd lose, dammit?"
"I say. Twenty. Is it a deal?"
"You're throwing your money away."
"No, I'm a sure winner, because you can't dance worth shoats and
shinola!"
"Where's your money?" cried Bug, incensed now.
"Here!"
"Where's your car!?"
"I don't own a car. Never learned to drive. Where's yours?"
"Sold it! Jesus, no cars. How do we get to the tea dance!?" We got. We
grabbed a cab and I paid and, before Bug could relent, dragged him
through the hotel lobby and into the ballroom. It was a nice summer
afternoon, so nice that the room was filled with mostly middle-aged men
and their wives, a few younger ones with their girlfriends, and some
kids out of college who looked out of place, embarrassed by the mostly
old-folks music out of another time. We got the last table and when Bug
opened his mouth for one last protest, I put a straw in it and helped
him nurse a marguerita.
"Why are you doing this?" he protested again.
"Because you were just one of one hundred sixty-five close friends!" I
said.
"We were never friends," said Bug.
"Well, today, anyway. There's 'Moonlight Serenade.' Always liked that,
never danced myself, clumsy fool. On your feet, Bug!"
He was on his feet, swaying.
"Who do you pick?" I said. "You cut in on a couple? Or there's a few
wallflowers over there, a tableful of women. I dare you to pick the
least likely and give her lessons, yes?"
      That did it. Casting me a glance of the purest scorn, he charged
off half into the pretty teatime dresses and immaculate men, searching
around until his eyes lit on a table where a woman of indeterminate age
sat, hands folded, face thin and sickly pale, half hidden under a
wide-brimmed hat, looking as if she were waiting for someone who never
came.
That one, I thought.
Bug glanced from her to me. I nodded. And in a moment he was bowing at
her table and a conversation ensued. It seemed she didn't dance, didn't
know how to dance, didn't want to dance. Ah, yes, he seemed to be
saying. Ah, no, she seemed to reply. Bug turned, holding her hand, and
gave me a long stare and a wink. Then, without looking at her, he raised
her by her hand and arm and out, with a seamless glide, onto the floor.
What can I say, how can I tell? Bug, long ago, had never bragged, but
only told the truth. Once he got hold of a girl, she was weightless. By
the time he had whisked and whirled and glided her once around the
floor, she almost took off, it seemed he had to hold her down, she was
pure gossamer, the closest thing to a hummingbird held in the hand so
you cannot feel its weight but only sense its heartbeat sounding to your
touch, and there she went out and around and back, with Bug guiding and
moving, enticing and retreating, and not fifty anymore, no, but
eighteen, his body remembering what his mind thought it had long
forgotten, for his body was free of the earth now, too. He carried
himself, as he carried her, with that careless insouciance of a lover
who knows what will happen in the next hour and the night soon
following.
And it happened, just like he said. Within a minute, a minute and a half
at most, the dance floor cleared. As Bug and his stranger lady whirled
by with a glance, every couple on the floor stood still. The bandleader
almost forgot to keep time with his baton, and the members of the
orchestra, in a similar trance, leaned forward over their instruments to
see Bug and his new love whirl and turn without touching the floor.
When the "Serenade" ended, there was a moment of stillness and then an
explosion of applause. Bug pretended it was all for the lady, and helped
her curtsy and took her to her table, where she sat, eyes shut, not
believing what had happened. By that time Bug was on the floor again,
with one of the wives he borrowed from the nearest table. This time, no
one even went out on the floor. Bug and the borrowed wife filled it
around and around, and this time even Bug's eyes were shut.
I got up and put twenty dollars on the table where he might find it.
After all, he had won the bet, hadn't he?
Why had I done it? Well, I couldn't very well have left him out in the
middle of the high school auditorium aisle dancing alone, could I?
On my way out I looked back. Bug saw me and waved, his eyes as brimmed
full as mine. Someone passing whispered, "Hey, come on, lookit this
guy!"
God, I thought, he'll be dancing all night.
Me, I could only walk.
And I went out and walked until I was fifty again and the sun was going
down and the low June fog was coming in early over old Los Angeles.
That night, just before going to sleep, I wished that in the morning
when Bug woke up he would find the floor around his bed covered with
trophies.
Or at the very least he would turn and find a quiet and understanding
trophy with her head on his pillow, near enough to touch.
ONCE MORE, LEGATO
Fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine
autumn and listened. The drink in his hand remained unsipped, his friend
Black unspoken to, the fine house unnoticed, the very weather  itself
neglected, for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above
them.
"My God," he mid. "Do you 'hear?"
“What, the birds?" asked his friend Black, doing just the opposite,
sipping his drink, noticing the weather, admiring the rich house, and
neglecting the birds entirely until this moment.
"Great God in heaven, listen to them!" cried Fentriss.
Black listened. "Rather nice."
"clean out your ears!"
Black made a halfhearted gesture, symbolizing the cleaning out of ears.
“Well?”
"Damn it, don't be funny. I mean really listen! They're singing a tune!”
"Birds usually do."
"No, they don't; birds paste together bits and pieces maybe, five or six
notes, eight at the most. Mockingbirds have repertoires that change, but
not entire melodies. These birds are different. Now shut up and give
over!"
Both men sat, enchanted. Black's expression melted.
"I'll be damned," he said at last. "They do go on." He leaned forward
and listened intently.
"Yes . . ." murmured Fentriss, eyes shut, nodding to the rhythms that
sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads. ". . .
ohmigod . . . indeed."
Black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up. Fentriss protested
with a fierce whisper:
“Don't spoil it. Sit. Be very still. Where's my pencil? Ah...”
Half peering around, he found a pencil and notepad, shut his eyes, and
began to scribble blindly.
The birds sang.
"You're not actually writing down their song?" said Black.
"What does it look like? Quiet."
And with eyes now open, now shut, Fentriss drew scales and jammed in the
notes.
"I didn't know you read music," said Black, astonished.
"I played the violin until my father broke it. Please! There. There.
Yes!
"Slower," he whispered. "Wait for me."
As if hearing, the birds adjusted their lilt, moving
toward piano instead of bravado.
A breeze stirred the leaves, like an invisible conductor, and the
singing died.
Fentriss, perspiration beading his forehead, stopped scribbling and fell
back.
"I'll be damned." Black gulped his drink. "What was that all about?"
"Writing a song." Fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper.
"Or a tone poem."
"Let me see that!"
"Wait." The tree shook itself gently, but produced no further notes. "I
want to be sure they're done."
Silence.
Black seized the pages and let his eyes drift over the scales. "Jesus,
Joseph, and Mary," he said, aghast. "It works." He glanced up at the
thick green of the tree, where no throat warbled, no wing stirred. "What
kind of birds are those?"
"The birds of forever, the small beasts of an Immaculate Musical
Conception. Something," said Fentriss, "has made them with child and its
name is song-"
"Hogwash!"
"Is it?! Something in the air, in the seeds they ate at dawn, some whim
of climate and weather, God! But now they're mine, it's mine. A fine
tune."
"It is'" said Black. "But can't be!"
"Never question the miraculous when it happens. Good grief, maybe those
damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible songs for
months, years, but no one listened. Today, for the first time,
someone did. Me! Now, what to do with the gift?"
"You don't seriously mean-?"
"I've been out of work for a year. I quit my computers, retired early,
I'm only forty-nine, and have been threatening to knit macrame' to give
friends to spoil their walls, day after day. Which shall it be, friend,
macrame' or Mozart?"
"Are you Mozart?"
"Just his bastard son."
"Nonsense," cried Black, pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the
trees as if he might blast the choir. "That tree, those birds, are a
Rorschach test. Your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from
pure chaos. There's no discernible tune, no special rhythm. You had me
fooled, but I see and hear it now: you've had a repressed desire since
childhood to compose. And you've let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by
the ears. Put down that pen!"
"Nonsense right back at you." Fentriss laughed. "You're jealous that
after twelve layabout years, thunderstruck with boredom, one of us has
found an occupation. I shall follow it. Listen and write, write and
listen. Sit down, you're obstructing the acoustics!"
"I'll sit," Black exclaimed, "but-" He clapped his hands over his ears.
"Fair enough," said Fentriss. "Escape fantastic reality while I change a
few notes and finish out this unexpected birth."
Glancing up at the tree, he whispered:
"Wait for me."
The tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet.
"Crazy," muttered Black.
One, two, three hours later, entering the library quietly and then
loudly, Black cried out:
"What are you doing?"
Bent over his desk, his hand moving furiously, Fentriss said:
"Finishing a symphony!"
"The same one you began in the garden?"
"No, the birds began, the birds!"
"The birds, then." Black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions.
"How do you know what to do with that stuff?"
"They did most. I've added variations!"
"An arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack. Have you
composed before?"
"Not"-Fentriss let his fingers roam, loop, and scratch-"until today!"
"You realize, of course, you're plagiarizing those songbirds?"
"Borrowing, Black, borrowing. If a milkmaid, singing at dawn, can have
her hum borrowed by Berlioz, well! Or if Dvorak, hearing a Dixie banjo
plucker pluck 'Goin' Home,' steals the banjo to eke out his New World,
why can't I weave a net to catch a tune? There! Finito. Done! Give us a
title, Black!"
"I? Who sings off-key?"
"What about 'The Emperor's Nightingale'?"
"Stravinsky."
"'The Birds'?"
"Hitchcock."
"Damn. How's this: 'It's Only John Cage in a Gilded Bird'?"
"Brilliant. But no one knows who John Cage was."
''Well, then, I've got it!" And he wrote:
"'Forty-seven Magpies Baked in a Pie.'
"Blackbirds, you mean; go back to John Cage."
"Bosh!" Fentriss stabbed the phone. "Hello, Willie? Could you come over?
Yes, a small job. Symphonic arrangement for a friend, or friends. What's
your usual Philharmonic fee? Eh? Good enough. Tonight!"
Fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonder in it.
"What next?" he murmured.
"Forty-seven Magpies," with title shortened, premiered at the Glendale
Chamber Symphony a month later with standing ovations, incredible
reviews.
Fentriss, outside his skin with joy, prepared to launch himself atop
large, small, symphonic, operatic, whatever fell on his ears. He had
listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks, but bad noted
nothing, waiting to see if the "Magpie" experiment was to be repeated.
When the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they
weren't skipping, he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy
ceased.
There followed: "Wings," "Flight," "Night Chorus," "The Fledgling
Madrigals," and "Dawn Patrol," each greeted by new thunderstorms of
acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise.
"By now," said Fentriss, "I should be unbearable to live with, but the
birds caution modesty."
"Also,'' said Black, seated under the tree, waiting for a sprig of
benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna, "shut up! If all those
sly dimwit composers, who will soon be lurking in the bushes, cop your
secret, you're a gone poacher."
"Poacher! By God, yes!" Fentriss laughed. "Poacher."
And damn if the first poacher didn't arrive!
Glancing out at tree in the morning, Fentriss witnessed a runty shadow
stretching up, handheld tape recorder poised, warbling and whistling
softly at the tree. when this failed, the half-seen poacher tried
dove-coos and then orioles and roosters, half dancing in a circle.
"Damn it to hell!" Fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry: "Is that
Wolfgang Prouty poaching my garden? Out, Wolfgang! Go!"
Dropping his recorder, Prouty vaulted a bush, impaled himself on thorns,
and vanished.
Fentriss, cursing, picked up an abandoned notepad.
"Nightsong," it read. On the tape recorder he found a lovely Satie-like
bird-choir.
After that, more poachers arrived mid-night to depart at dawn. Their
spawn, Fentriss realized, would soon throttle his creativity and still
his voice. He loitered full-time in the garden now, not knowing what
seed to give his beauties, and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up
worms. Wearily he stood guard through sleepless nights, nodding off only
to find Wolfgang Prouty's evil minions astride the wall, prompting
arias, and one night, by God, perched in the tree itself, humming in
hopes of sing-alongs.
A shotgun was the final answer. After its first fiery roar, the garden
was empty for a week. That is, until-    Someone came very late indeed
and committed mayhem.
As quietly as possible, he cut the branches and sawed the limbs.
"Oh, envious composers, dreadful murderers!" cried Fentriss.
And the birds were gone.
And the career of Amadeus Two with it.
"Black!" cried Fentriss.
"Yes, dear friend?" said Black, looking at the bleak sky where once
green was.
"Is your car outside?"
"When last I looked."
"Drive!"
But driving in search didn't do it. It wasn't like calling in lost dogs
or telephone-poled cats. They must find and cage an entire Mormon
tabernacle team of soprano springtime-in-the-Rockies birdseed lovers to
prove one in the hand is worth two in the bush.
But still they hastened from block to block, garden to garden, lurking
and listening. Now their spirits soared with an echo of "Hallelujah
Chorus" oriole warbling, only to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of
despair.
Only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt
and greens did one of them finally (Black) light his pipe and emit a
theory.
"Did you ever think to wonder," he mused behind a smoke-cloud,
"what season of the year this is?"
"Season of the year?" said Fentriss, exasperated.
"Well, coincidentally, wasn't the night the tree fell and the wee
songsters blew town, was not that the first fall night of autumn?"
Fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow.
"You mean?"
"Your friends have flown the coop. Their migration must be above San
Miguel Allende just now."
"If they are migratory birds!"
"Do you doubt it?"
Another pained silence, another blow to the head.
''Shit!''
"Precisely," said Black.
"Friend," said Fentriss.
"Sir?"
"Drive home."
It was a long year, it was a short year, it was a year of anticipation,
it was the burgeoning of despair, it was the revival of inspiration, but
at its heart, Fentriss knew, just another Tale of Two Cities, but he did
not know what the other city was!
How stupid of me, he thought, not to have guessed or imagined that my
songsters we're wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime
swarmed north in A Cappella choirs of sound.
"The waiting," he told Black, "is madness. The phone never stops-"
The phone rang. He picked it up and addressed it like a child. "Yes.
Yes. Of course. Soon. When? Very soon." And put the phone down. "You
see? That was Philadelphia. They want another Cantata as good as the
first. At dawn today it was Boston. Yesterday the Vienna
Philharmonic. Soon, I say. When? God knows. Lunacy! Where are those
angels that once sang me to my rest?"
He threw down maps and weather charts of Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and
the Argentines.
"How far south? Do I scour Buenos Aires or Rio, Mazatlan or Cuernavaca?
And then? Wander about with a tin ear, standing under trees waiting for
bird-drops like a spotted owl? Will the Argentine critics trot by
scoffing to see me leaning on trees, eyes shut, waiting for the
quasi-melody, the lost chord? I'd let no one know the cause of my
journey, my search, otherwise pandemoniums of laughter. But in what
city, under what kind of tree would I wander to stand? A tree like mine?
Do they seek the same roosts? or will anything do in Ecuador or Peru?
God, I could waste months guessing and come back with birdseed in my
hair and bird bombs on my lapels. What to do, Black? Speak!"
"Well, for one thing"-Black stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his
aromatic concepts-' 'you might clear off this stump and plant a new
tree."
They had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration.
Fentriss froze with one foot raised. "Say that again?!"
"I said-"
"Good grief, you genius! Let me kiss you!"
"Rather not. Hugs, maybe."
Fentriss hugged him, wildly. "Friend!"
"Always was."
"Let's get a shovel and spade."
"You get. I'll watch."
Fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax.
"Sure you won't join me?"
Black sucked his pipe, blew smoke. "Later."
"How much would a full-grown tree cost?"
"Too much."
"Yes, but if it were here and the birds did return?" Black let out more
smoke. "Might be worth it. Opus Number Two: 'In the Beginning' by
Charles Fentriss, stuff like that."
'In the Beginning,' or maybe 'The Return.'‘”
"One of those."
"Or-" Fentriss struck the stump with the pickax. " 'Rebirth.' " He
struck again. "'Ode to Joy.' " Another strike.
'Spring Harvest.' " Another. "'Let the Heavens Resound.' How's that,
Black?"
"I prefer the other," said Black.
The stump was pulled and the new tree bought.
"Don't show me the bill," Fentriss told his accountant. "Pay it."
And the tallest tree they could find, of the same family as the one dead
and gone, was planted.
"What if it dies before my choir returns?" said Fentriss. "What if
it lives," said Black, "and your choir goes elsewhere?"
The tree, planted, seemed in no immediate need to die. Neither did it
look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far
southern places.
Meanwhile, the sky, like the tree, was empty. "Don't they know
I'm waiting?" said Fentriss. "Not unless," offered Black, "you majored
in cross-continental telepathy."
"I've checked with Audubon. They say that while the swallows do come
back to Capistrano on a special day, give or take a white lie, other
migrating species are often one or two weeks late."
"If I were you," said Black, "I would plunge into an intense love affair
to distract you while you wait."
"I am fresh out of love affairs."
"Well, then," said Black, "suffer."
The hours passed slower than the minutes, the days passed slower than
the hours, the weeks passed slower than the days. Black called. "No
birds?"
"No birds."
"Pity. I can't stand watching you lose weight." And Black disconnected.
On a final night, when Fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the
wall, fearful of another call from the Boston Symphony, he leaned an ax
against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky.
"Last chance," he said. "If the dawn patrol doesn't show by seven a.m.,
it's quits."
And he touched ax-blade against the tree-bole, took two shots of vodka
so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes, and went to bed.
He awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze
outside his window, stirring the leaves, with not a ghost of song.
And awoke at dawn with tear-filled eyes, having dreamed that the birds
had returned, but knew, in waking, it was only a dream.
And yet...?
Hark, someone might have said in an old novel. List! as in an old play.
Eyes shut, he fine-tuned his ears .
The tree outside, as he arose, looked fatter, as if it had taken on
invisible ballasts in the night. There were stirrings there, not of
simple breeze or probing winds, but of something in the very leaves that
knitted and purled them in rhythms. He dared not look but lay back down
to ache his senses and try to know.
A single chirp hovered in the window.
He waited.
Silence.
Go on, he thought.
Another chirp.
Don't breathe, he thought; don't let them know you're listening.
Hush.
A fourth sound, then a fifth note, then a sixth and seventh. My God, he
thought, is this a substitute orchestra, a replacement choir come to
scare off my loves?
Another five notes.
Perhaps, he prayed, they're only tuning up!
Another twelve notes, of no special timbre or pace, and as he was about
to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunch-It happened. Note
after note, line after line, fluid melody following spring freshet
melody, the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous
proclamations of return and welcome in chorus.
And as they sang, Fentriss sneaked his hand to find a pad and pen to
hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir
that soared and dipped to soar again, firing the bright air that flowed
from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to
remember.
The phone rang. He picked it up swiftly to hear Black ask
if the waiting was over. Without speaking, he held the receiver in the
window.
"I'll be damned," said Black's voice.
"No, anointed," whispered the composer, scribbling Cantata No.2.
Laughing, he called softly to the sky.
"Please. More slowly. Legato, not agitato."
And the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed.
Agitato ceased.
Legato prevailed.
EXCHANGE
There were too many cards in the file, too many books on the shelves,
too many children laughing in the children's room, too many newspapers
to fold and stash on the racks ...
All in all, too much. Miss Adams pushed her gray hair back over her
lined brow, adjusted her gold-rimmed pince-nez, and rang the small
silver bell on the library desk, at the same time switching off and on
all the lights. The exodus of adults and children was exhausting. Miss
Ingraham, the assistant librarian, had gone home early because her
father was sick, so it left the burden of stamping, filing, and checking
books squarely on Miss Adams' shoulders.
Finally the last book was stamped, the last child fed through the great
brass doors, the doors locked, and with immense weariness, Miss Adams
moved back up through a silence of forty years of books and being keeper
of the books, stood for a long moment by the main desk.
She laid her glasses down on the green blotter, and pressed the bridge
of her small-boned nose between thumb and forefinger and held it, eyes
shut. What a racket! Children who finger-painted or cartooned
frontispieces or rattled their roller skates. High school students
arriving with laughters, departing with mindless songs!
Taking up her rubber stamp, she probed the files, weeding out errors,
her fingers whispering between Dante and Darwin.
A moment later she heard the rapping on the front-door glass and saw a
man's shadow outside, wanting in. She shook her head. The figure pleaded
silently, making gestures.
Sighing, Miss Adams opened the door, saw a young man in uniform, and
said, "It's late. We're closed." She glanced at his insignia and added,
"Captain."
"Hold on!" said the captain. "Remember me?"
And repeated it, as she hesitated.
"Remember?"
She studied his face, trying to bring light out of shadow. "Yes, I think
I do," she said at last. "You once borrowed books here."
"Right."
"Many years ago," she added. "Now I almost have you placed."
As he stood waiting she tried to see him in those other years, but his
younger face did not come clear, or a name with it, and his hand reached
out now to take hers.
"May I come in?"
"Well." She hesitated. "Yes."
She led the way up the steps into the immense twilight of books. The
young officer looked around and let his breath out slowly, then reached
to take a book and hold it to his nose, inhaling, then almost laughing.
"Don't mind me, Miss Adams. You ever smell new books? Binding, pages,
print. Like fresh bread when you're hungry." He glanced around. "I'm
hungry now, but don't even know what for."
There was a moment of silence, so she asked him how long he might stay.
"Just a few hours. I'm on the train from New York to L.A., so I came up
from Chicago to see old places, old friends." His eyes were troubled and
he fretted his cap, turning it in his long, slender fingers.
She said gently, "Is anything wrong? Anything I can help you with?"
He glanced out the window at the dark town, with just a few lights in
the windows of the small houses across the way.
"I was surprised," he said.
"By what?"
"I don't know what I expected. Pretty damn dumb," he said, looking from
her to the windows, "to expect that when I went away, everyone froze in
place waiting for me to come home. That when I stepped off the train,
all my old pals would unfreeze, run down, meet me at the station.
Silly."
"No," she said, more easily now. "I think we all imagine that. I visited
Paris as a young girl, went back to France when I was forty, and was
outraged that no one had waited, buildings had vanished, and all the
hotel staff where I had once lived had died, retired, or traveled."
He nodded at this, but could not seem to go on.
"Did anyone know you were coming?" she asked.
"I wrote a few, but no answers. I figured, hell, they're busy, but
they'll be there. They weren't."
She felt the next words come off her lips and was faintly surprised.
"I'm still here," she said.
"You are," he said with a quick smile. "And I can't tell you how glad I
am."
He was gazing at her now with such intensity that she had to look away.
"You know," she said, "I must confess you look familiar, but I don't
quite fit your face with the boy who came here-"
"Twenty years ago! And as for what he looked like, that other one, me,
well-"
He brought out a smallish wallet which held a dozen pictures and handed
over a photograph of a boy perhaps twelve years old, with an impish
smile and wild blond hair, looking as if he might catapult out of the
frame.
"Ah, yes." Miss Adams adjusted her pince-nez and closed her eyes to
remember. "That one. Spaulding. William Henry Spaulding?"
He nodded and peered at the picture in her hands anxiously.
"Was I a lot of trouble?"
"Yes." She nodded and held the picture closer and glanced up at him. "A
fiend." She handed the picture back. "But I loved you."
"Did you?" he said and smiled more broadly.
"In spite of you, yes."
He waited a moment and then said, "Do you still love me?"
She looked to left and right as if the dark stacks held the answer.
"It's a little early to know, isn't it?"
"Forgive."
"No, no, a good question. Time will tell. Let's not stand like your
frozen friends who didn't move. Come along. I've just had some
late-night coffee. There may be some left. Give me your cap. Take off
that coat. The file index is there. Go look up your old library cards
for the hell-heck-of it."
"Are they still there?" In amaze.
"Librarians save everything. You never know who's coming in on the next
train. Go."
When she came back with the coffee, he stood staring down into the index
file like a bird fixing its gaze on a half-empty nest. He handed her one
of the old purple-stamped cards.
"Migawd," he said, "I took out a lot of books."
"Ten at a time. I said no, but you took them. And," she
added, "read them! Here." She put his cup on top of the file and waited
while he drew out canceled card after card and laughed quietly.
"I can't believe. I must not have lived anywhere else but here. May I
take this with me, to sit?" He showed the cards. She nodded. "Can you
show me around? I mean, maybe I've forgotten something."
She shook her head and took his elbow. "I doubt that. Come on. Over
here, of course, is the adult section."
"I begged you to let me cross over when I was thirteen. 'You're not
ready,' you said. But-"
"I let you cross over anyway?"
"You did. And much thanks."
Another thought came to him as he looked down at her.
"You used to be taller than me," he said.
She looked up at him, amused.
"I've noticed that happens quite often in my life, but I can still
do this."
Before he could move, she grabbed his chin in her thumb and forefinger
and held tight. His eyes rolled.
He said:
"I remember. When I was really bad you'd hold on and put your face down
close and scowl. The scowl did it. After ten seconds of your holding my
chin very tight, I behaved for days."
She nodded, released his chin. He rubbed it and as they moved on he
ducked his head, not looking at her.
"Forgive, I hope you won't be upset, but when I was a boy I used to look
up and see you behind your desk, so near but far away, and, how can I
say this, I used to think that you were Mrs. God, and that the library
was a whole world, and that no matter what part of the world or what
people or thing I wanted to see and read, you'd find and give it to me."
He stopped, his face coloring. "You did, too. You had the world ready
for me every time I asked. There was always a place I hadn't seen, a
country I hadn't visited where you took me. I've never forgotten."
She looked around, slowly, at the thousands of books. She felt her heart
move quietly. "Did you really call me what you just said?"
"Mrs. God? Oh, yes. Often. Always."
“Come along," she said at last.
They walked around the rooms together and then downstairs to the
newspaper files, and coming back up, he suddenly leaned against the
banister, holding tight.
"Miss Adams," he said.
"What is it, Captain?"
He exhaled. "I'm scared. I don't want to leave. I'm afraid."
Her hand, all by itself, took his arm and she finally said, there in the
shadows, "Sometimes-I'm afraid, too. What frightens you?"
"I don't want to go away without saying good-bye. If I never return, I
want to see all my friends, shake hands, slap them on the back, I don't
know, make jokes." He stopped and waited, then went on. "But I walk
around town and nobody knows me. Everyone's gone."
The pendulum on the wall clock slid back and forth, shining, with the
merest of sounds.
Hardly knowing where she was going, Miss Adams took his arm and guided
him up the last steps, away from the marble vaults below, to a final,
brightly decorated room, where he glanced around and shook his head.
"There's no one here, either."
"Do you believe that?"
"Well, where are they? Do any of my old pals ever come visit, borrow
books, bring them back late?"
"Not often," she said. "But listen. Do you realize Thomas Wolfe was
wrong?"
"Wolfe? The great literary beast? Wrong?"
"The title of one of his books."
"You Can't Go Home Again?" he guessed.
"That's it. He was wrong. This is home. Your friends are still here.
This was your summer place."
"Yes. Myths. Legends. Mummies. Aztec kings. Wicked sisters who spat
toads. Where I really lived. But I don't see my people."
"Well."
And before he could speak, she switched on a green-shaded lamp that shed
a private light on a small table.
"Isn't this nice?" she said. "Most libraries today, too much light.
There should be shadows, don't you think? Some mystery, yes? So that
late nights the beasts can prowl out of the stacks and crouch by this
jungle light to turn the pages with their breath. Am I crazy?"
"Not that I noticed."
"Good. Sit. Now that I know who you are, it all comes back."
"It couldn't possibly."
"No? You'll see."
She vanished into the stacks and came out with ten books that she placed
upright, their pages a trifle spread so they could stand and he could
read the titles.
"The summer of 1930, when you were, what? ten, you read all of these in
one week."
"Oz? Dorothy? The Wizard? Oh, yes."
She placed still others nearby. "Alice in Wonderland. Through the
Looking-Glass. A month later you reborrowed both. 'But,' I said, 'you've
already read them!' 'But,' you said, 'not enough so I can speak. I want
to be able to tell them out loud.'
"My God," he said quietly, "did I say that?"
"You did. Here's more you read a dozen times. Greek myths, Roman,
Egyptian. Norse myths, Chinese. You were ravenous."
"King Tut arrived from the tomb when I was three. His picture in the
Rotogravure started me. What else have you there?"
"Tarzan of the Apes. You borrowed it . .
"Three dozen times! John Carter, Warlord of Mars, four dozen. My God,
dear lady, how come you remember all this?"
"You never left. Summertimes you were here when I unlocked the doors.
You went home for lunch but sometimes brought sandwiches and sat out by
the stone lion at noon. Your father pulled you home by your ear some
nights when you stayed late. How could I forget a boy like that?"
"But still-"
"You never played, never ran out in baseball weather, or football, I
imagine. Why?"
He glanced toward the front door. "They were waiting for me."
"They?"
"You know. The ones who never borrowed books, never read. They.
Them. Those."
She looked and remembered. "Ah, yes. The bullies. Why did they chase
you?"
"Because they knew I loved books and didn't much care for them."
"It's a wonder you survived. I used to watch you getting, reading
hunchbacked, late afternoons. You looked so lonely."
"No. I had these. Company."
"Here's more."
She put down Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and Treasure Island.
"Oh," he said, "and dear and strange Mr. Poe. How I loved his Red
Death."
"You took it so often I told you to keep it on permanent loan unless
someone else asked. Someone did, six months later, and when you brought
it in I could see it was a terrible blow. A few days later I let you
have Poe for another year. I don't recall, did you ever-?"
"It's out in California. Shall I-"
"No, no. Please. Well, here are your books. Let me bring others."
She came out not carrying many books but one at a time, as if each one
were, indeed, special.
She began to make a circle inside the other Stonehenge circle and as she
placed the books, in lonely splendor, he said their names and then the
names of the authors who had written them and then the names of those
who had sat across from him so many years ago and read the books quietly
or sometimes whispered the finest parts aloud, so beautifully that no
one said Quiet or Silence or even Shh!
She placed the first book and there was a wild field of broom and a wind
blowing a young woman across that field as it began to snow and
someone, far away, called "Kathy" and as the snows fell he saw a girl he
had walked to school in the sixth grade seated across the table, her
eyes fixed to the windblown field and the snow and the lost woman in
another time of winter.
A second book was set in place and a black and beauteous horse raced
across a summer field of green and on that horse was another girl, who
hid behind the book and dared to pass him notes when he was twelve.
And then there was the far ghost with a snow-maiden face whose hair was
a long golden harp played by the summer airs; she who was always sailing
to Byzantium where Emperors were drowsed by golden birds that sang in
clockwork cages at sunset and dawn. She who always skirted the outer rim
of school and went to swim in the deep lake ten thousand afternoons ago
and never came out, so was never found, but suddenly now she made
landfall here in the green-shaded light and opened Yeats to at last sail
home from Byzantium.
And on her right: John Huff, whose name came clearer than the rest, who
claimed to have climbed every tree in town and fallen from none, who had
raced through watermelon patches treading melons, never touching earth,
to knock down rainfalls of chestnuts with one blow, who yodeled at your
sun-up window and wrote the same Mark Twain book report in four
different grades before the teachers caught on, at which he said,
vanishing, "Just call me Huck."
And to his right, the pale son of the town hotel owner who looked as if
he had gone sleepless forever, who swore every empty house was haunted
and took you there to prove it, with a juicy tongue, compressed nose,
and throat gargling that sounded the long October demise, the terrible
and unutterable fall of the House of Usher.
And next to him was yet another girl.
And next to her ...
And just beyond ...
Miss Adams placed a final book and he recalled the fair creature, long
ago, when such things were left unsaid, glancing up at him one day when
he was an unknowing twelve and she was a wise thirteen to quietly say:
"I am Beauty. And you, are you the Beast?"
Now, late in time, he wanted to answer that small and wondrous ghost:
"No. He hides in the stacks and when the clock strikes three, will prowl
forth to drink."
And it was finished, all the books were placed, the outer ring of his
selves and the inner ring of remembered faces, deathless, with summer
and autumn names.
He sat for a long moment and then another long moment and then, one by
one, reached for and took all of the books that had been his, and still
were, and opened them and read and shut them and took another until he
reached the end of the outer circle and then went to touch and turn and
find the raft on the river, the field of broom where the storms lived,
and the pasture with the black and beauteous horse and its lovely rider.
Behind him, he heard the lady librarian quietly back away to leave him
with words .
A long while later he sat back, rubbed his yes, and looked around at the
fortress, the encirclement, the Roman encampment of books, and nodded,
his eyes wet.
"Yes."
He heard her move behind him.
"Yes, what?"
"What you said, Thomas Wolfe, the title of that book of his. Wrong.
Everything's here. Nothing's changed."
"Nothing will as long as I can help it,,, she said.
"Don't ever go away."
"I won't if you'll come back more often."
Just then, from below the town, not so very far off, a train whistle
blew. She said:
"Is that yours?"
"No, but the one soon after," he said and got up and moved around the
small monuments that stood very tall and one by one, shut the covers,
his lips moving to sound the old titles and the old, dear names.
"Do we have to put them back on the shelves?" he said. She looked at him
and at the double circle and after a long moment said, "Tomorrow will
do. Why?"
"Maybe," he said, "during the night, because of the color of those
lamps, green, the jungle, maybe those creatures you mentioned will come
out and turn the pages with their breath. And maybe-"
"What else?"
"Maybe my friends, who've hid in the stacks all these years, will come
out, too.',
"They're already here," she said quietly.
"Yes." He nodded. "They are."
And still he could not move.
She backed off across the room without making any sound, and when she
reached her desk she called back, the last call of the night.
"Closing time. Closing time, children."
And turned the lights quickly off and then on and then halfway between;
a library twilight.
He moved from the table with the double circle of books and came to her
and said, "I Can go now."
"Yes," she said. "William Henry Spaulding. You can." They walked
together as she turned out the lights, turned out the lights, one by
one. She helped him into his coat and
then, hardly thinking to do so, he took her hand and kissed her fingers.
It was so abrupt, she almost laughed, but then she said, "Remember what
Edith Whanon said when Henry James did what you just did?"
"What?"
'The flavor starts at the elbow.'
They broke into laughter together and he turned and went down the marble
steps toward the stained-glass entry. At the bottom of the stairs he
looked up at her and said:
"Tonight, when you're going to sleep, remember what I called you when I
was twelve, and say it out loud."
"I don't remember," she said.
"Yes, you do."
Below the town, a train whistle blew again.
He opened the front door, stepped out, and he was gone. Her hand on the
last light switch, looking in at the double circle of books on the far
table, she thought: What was it he called me?
"Oh, yes," she said a moment later.
And switched off the light.
FREE DIRT
The cemetery was in the center of the city. On four sides it was bounded
by gliding streetcars on glistening blue tracks and cars with exhaust
fumes and sound. But, once inside the wall, the world was lost. For half
a mile in four directions the cemetery raised midnight trees and
headstones that grew from the earth, like pale mushrooms, moist and
cold. A gravel path led back into darkness and within the gate stood a
Gothic Victorian house with six gables and a cupola. The front-porch
light showed an old man there alone, not smoking, not reading, not
moving, silent. If you took a deep breath he smelled of the sea, of
urine, of papyrus, of kindling, of ivory, and of teak. His false teeth
moved his mouth automatically when it wanted to talk. His tiny yellow
seed eyes twitched and his poke-hole nostrils thinned as a stranger
crunched up the gravel path and set foot on the porch step.
“Good evening!” said the stranger, a young man, perhaps twenty.
The old man nodded, but his hands lay quietly on his knees "I saw that
sign out front," the stranger went on. "FREE DIRT, it said."
The old man almost nodded.
The stranger tried a smile. "Crazy, but that sign caught my eye.
There was a glass fan over the front door. A light shone through this
glass fan, colored blue, red, yellow, and touched the old man's face. It
seemed not to bother him.
"I wondered, free dirt? Never struck me you'd have much left over. When
you dig a hole and put the coffin in and refill the hole, you haven't
much dirt left, have you? I should think..."
The old man leaned forward. It was so unexpected that the stranger
pulled his foot off the bottom step.
"You want some?" said the old man.
"Why, no, no, I was just curious. Signs like that make you curious."
"Set down," said the old man.
"Thanks." The young man sat uneasily on the steps. "You know how it is,
you walk around and never think how it is to own a graveyard."
"And?" said the old man.
"I mean, like how much time it takes to dig graves."
The old man leaned back in his chair. "On a cool day:
two hours. Hot day, four. Very hot day, six. Very cold day, not cold so
it freezes, but real cold, a man can dig a grave in one hour so he can
head in for hot chocolate, brandy in the chocolate. Then again, you get
a good man on a hot day, he's no better than a bad man in the cold.
Might take eight hours to open up, but here's easy-digging soil here.
All loam, no rocks."
"I'm curious about winter."
"In blizzards we got a icebox mausoleum to stash the dead, undelivered
mail, until spring and a whole month of shovels and spades."
"Seeding and planting time, eh?" The stranger laughed.
"You might say that."
"Don't you dig in winter anyhow? For special funerals? Special dead?"
"Some yards got a hose-shovel contraption. Pump hot water through the
blade; shape a grave quick, like placer mining, even with the ground an
ice-pond. We don't cotton to that. Use picks and shovels."
The young man hesitated. "Does it bother you?"
"You mean, I get scared ever?"
"Well . . . yes."
The old man at last took out and stuffed his pipe with tobacco, tamped
it with a callused thumb, lit it, let out a small stream of smoke.
"No," he said at last.
The young man's shoulders sank. "Disappointed?" said the old man. "I
thought maybe once .
“Oh, when you're young, maybe. One time ...”
"Then there was a time!" The young man shifted up a step. The old man
glanced at him sharply, then resumed smoking. "One time." He stared at
the marbled hills and the dark trees. "My grandpa owned this yard. I was
born here. A gravedigger' 5 son learns toignore things."
The old man took a number of deep puffs and said:
"I was just eighteen, folks off on vacation, me left to tend things,
alone, mow the lawn, dig holes and such. Alone, four graves to dig in
October and a cold came hard off the lake, frost on the graves,
tombstones like snow, ground froze solid.
"One night I walked out. No moon. Hard grass underfoot, could see my
breath, hands in my pockets, walking, listening."
The old man exhaled frail ghosts from his thin nostrils. "Then I heard
this sound, deep under. I froze. It was a voice, screaming. Someone woke
up buried, heard me walk by, cried out. I just stood. They screamed and
screamed. Earth banged. On a cold night, ground's like porcelain, rings,
you see?
"Well-" The old man shut his eyes to remember. "I stood like the wind
off the lake stopped my blood. A joke? I searched around and thought,
Imagination! No, it was underfoot, sharp, clear. A woman's voice.
I knew all the gravestones." The old man's eyelids trembled. "Could
recite them alphabetical, year, month, day. Name any year, and I'll
tell. How about 1899? Jake Smith departed. And 1923? Betty Dallman lost.
And 1933? P. H. Moran! Name a month. August? August last year, buried
Henrietta Wells. August 1918? Grandma Hanlon, whole family!
Influenza! Name a day, August fourth? Smith, Burke, Shelby carried off.
Williamson? He's on that hill, pink marble. Douglas? By the creek ...”
"The story," the young man urged.
     “Eh?”
"The story you were telling."
"Oh, the voice below? Well, I knew all the stones. Standing there, I
guessed that voice out of the ground was Henrietta Fremwell, fine girl,
twenty-four years, played piano at the Elite Theatre. Tall, graceful,
blond. How did I know her voice? I stood where there was only men's
graves. Hers was the only woman's. I ran to put my ear on her stone.
Yes! Her voice, way down, screaming!
"'Miss Fremwell!' I shouted.
"'Miss Fremwell,' I yelled again.
"Deep down I heard her, only weeping now. Maybe she heard me, maybe not.
She just cried. I ran downhill so fast I tripped and split my head on a
stone, got up, screamed myself! Got to the tool shed, all blood, dragged
out the tools, and just stood there in the moonlight with one shovel.
The ground was ice solid, solid. I fell back against a tree. It would
take three minutes to get back to her grave, and eight hours of cold
night to dig to her box. The ground was like glass. A coffin is a
coffin; only so much space for air. Henrietta Fremwell had been buried
two days before the freeze, been asleep all that time, using up air, and
it rained just before the cold spell and the earth over her, soaked with
rainwater now, froze. I'd have to dig maybe eight hours. And the way she
cried, there wasn't another hour of air left."
The old man's pipe had gone out. He rocked in his chair, back and forth,
back and forth, silently.
"But," said the young man, "what did you do?"
"Nothing," said the old man.
"Nothing!?"
"Nothing I could do. That ground was solid. Six men couldn't have dug
that grave. No hot water near. And she might've been
screaming hours before I heard, so . .
"You did-nothing?"
"Something Put the shovel and pick back in the tool shed, locked it and
went back to the house and built a fire and drank some hot chocolate,
shivering and shivering. Would you have done different?"
“I-”
"Would you have dug for eight hours in hard ice rock so's to reach her
when she was truly dead of exhaustion, cold, smothered, and have to bury
her all over again? Then call her folks and tell them?"
The young man was silent. On the porch, the mosquitoes hummed about the
naked light bulb.
"I see," said the young man.
The old man sucked his pipe. "I think I cried all night because there
was nothing I could do." He opened his eyes and stared about, surprised,
as if he had been listening to someone else.
"That's quite a story," said the young man.
"No," said the old man, "God's truth. Want to hear more? See that big
stone with the ugly angel? That was Adam Crispin's. Relatives fought,
got a writ from a judge, dug him up hoping for poison. Found nothing.
Put him back, but by that time the dirt from his grave mixed with other
dirts. We shoveled in stuff from all around. Next plot, the angel with
broken wings? Mary-Lou Phipps. Dug her up to lug her off to Elgin,
Illinois. More relatives. Where she'd been, the pit stayed open, oh,
three weeks. No funerals. Meanwhile, her dirt got cross-shoveled with
others. Six stones over, one stone north, that was Henry Douglas Jones.
Became famous sixty years after no one paid attention. Now he's planted
under the Civil War monument. His grave lay wide two months, nobody
wanted to utilize the hole of a Southerner, all of us leaning North with
Grant. So his dirt got scattered. That give you some notion of what that
FREE DIRT sign means?"
The young man eyed the cemetery landscape. "Well," he said,
"where is that dirt you're handing out?"
The old man pointed with his pipe and the stranger looked and indeed, by
a nearby wall was a sizable hillock some ten feet long by about three
feet high, loam and grass tufts of many shades of tan, brown, and burnt
umber.
"Go look," said the old man.
The young man walked slowly over to stand by the mound.
"Kick it," said the old man. "See if it's real."
The young man kicked and his face paled.
"Did you hear that?" he said.
"What?" said the old man, looking somewhere else.
The stranger listened and shook his head. "Nothing."
"Well, now," said the old man, knocking out the ashes from his pipe.
"How much free dirt you need?"
"I hadn't thought."
"Yes, you have," said the old man, "or you wouldn't have driven your
lightweight delivery truck up by the cemetery gate. I got cat's ears.
Heard your motor just when you stopped. How much?"
"Oh," said the young man uneasily. "My backyard's eighty feet by forty.
I could use a good inch of topsoil. So ...?”
"I'd say," said the old man, "half of that mound there. Hell, take it
all. Nobody wants it."
"You mean-"
"I mean, that mound has been growing and diminishing, diminishing and
growing, mixtures up and down, since Grant took Richmond and Sherman
reached the sea. There's Civil dirt there, coffin splinters, satin
casket shreds from when Lafayette met the Honor Guard's Edgar Allan Poe.
There's funeral flowers, blossoms from ten hundred obsequies.
Condolence-card confetti for Hessian troopers, Parisian gunners who
never shipped home. That soil is so laced with bone meal and casket
corsages, I should charge you to buy the lot. Grab a spade before I do."
"Stay right there." The young man raised one hand.
"I'm not going anywhere," said the old man. "Nor is anyone else nearby."
The half-truck was pulled up by the dirt mound and the young man was
reaching in for a spade when the old man said:
"No, I think not."
The old man went on:
"Graveyard spade's best. Familiar metal, familiar soil. Easy digging
when like takes to like. So."
The old man's head indicated a spade half stuck in the dark mound. The
young man shrugged and moved.
The cemetery spade came free with a soft whispering. Pellets of ancient
mound fell with similar whispers.
He began to dig and shift and fill the back of his half-truck as the old
man from the corners of his eyes observed:
“It's more than dirt, as I said. War of 1812, San Juan Hill, Manassas,
Gettysburg, October flu epidemic 1918, all strewn from graves filled and
evicted to be refilled. Various occupants leavened out to dust, various
glories melted to mixtures, rust from metal caskets, coffin handles,
shoelaces but no shoes, hairs long and short. Ever see wreaths made of
hair saved to weave crowns to fix on mortal pictures? All that's left of
a smile or that funny look in the eyes of someone who knows she's not
alive anymore, ever. Hair, epaulettes, not whole ones, but one strand of
epaulette, all there along with blood that's gone to silt."
The young man finished, sweating, and started to thrust the spade back
in the earth when the old man said:
"Take it. Cemetery dirt, cemetery spade, like takes to like."
"I'll bring it back tomorrow." The young man tossed the spade into the
mounded truck.
"No. You got the dirt, so keep the spade. Just don't bring the free
dirt back."
"Why would I do that?"
"Just don't," said the old man, but did not move as the young man
climbed in his truck to start the engine.
He sat listening to the dirt mound tremble and whisper in the flatbed.
"What're you waiting for?" asked the old man.
_     _      *
The flimsy half-truck ran toward the last of the twilight, pursued by
the ever-encroaching dark. Clouds raced overhead, perturbed by the
invisible. Back on the horizon, thunder sounded. A few drops of rain
fell on the windshield, causing the young man to ram his foot on the gas
and swerve into his home street even as the sun truly died, the wind
rose, and the trees around his cottage bent and beckoned.
Climbing out, he stared at the sky and then his house and then the empty
garden. A few drops of cold rain on his cheeks decided him; he drove the
rattling half-truck into the empty garden, unlatched the metal
back-flap, opened it just an inch so as to allow a proper flow, and then
began motoring back and forth across the garden, letting the dark stuffs
whisper down, letting the strange midnight earth sift and murmur, until
at last the truck was empty and he stood in the blowing night, watching
the wind stir the black soil.
Then he locked the truck in the garage and went to stand on the back
porch, thinking, I won't need water. The storm will soak the ground.
He stood for a long while simply staring at the graveyard mulch, waiting
for rain, until he thought, what am I waiting for? Jesus! And went in.
At ten o'clock a light rain tapped on the windows and sifted over the
dark garden. At eleven it rained so steadily that the gutter drains
swallowed and rattled.
At midnight the rain grew heavy. He looked to see if it was eroding the
new dark earth but saw only the black muck drinking the downpour like a
great black sponge, lit by distant flares of lightning.
Then, at one in the morning, the greatest Niagara of all shuddered the
house, rinsed the windows to blindness, and shook the lights.
And then, abruptly, the downpour, the immense Niagara ceased, followed
by one great downfell blow of lightning which plowed and pinioned the
dark earth close by, near, outside, with explosions of light as if ten
thousand flashbulbs had been fired off. Then darkness fell in curtains
of thunder, cracking, breaking the bones.
In bed, wishing for the merest dog to hold for lack of human company,
hugging the sheets, burying his head, then rising full to the silent
air, the dark air, the storm gone, the rain shut, and a silence that
spread in whispers as the last drench melted into the trembling soil.
He shuddered and then shivered and then hugged himself to stop the
shivering of his cold flesh, and he was thirsty but could not make
himself move to find the kitchen and drink water, milk, leftover wine,
anything. He lay back, dry-mouthed, with unreasonable tears filling his
eyes.
Free dirt, he thought. My God, what a damn-fool night. Free dirt!
At two o'clock he heard his wristwatch ticking softly.
At two-thirty he felt his pulse in his wrists and ankles and neck and
then in his temples and inside his head.
The entire house leaned into the wind, listening.
Outside in the still night, the wind failed and the yard lay soaked and
waiting.
And at last ... yes. He opened his eyes and turned his head toward the
shaded window.
He held his breath. what? Yes? Yes? What?
Beyond the window, beyond the wall, beyond the house, outside somewhere,
a whisper, a murmur, growing louder and louder. Grass growing? Blossoms
opening? Soil shifting, crumbling?
A great whisper, a mix of shadows and shades. Something rising.
Something moving.
Ice froze beneath his skin. His heart ceased.
Outside in the dark, in the yard.
Autumn had arrived.
October was there.
His garden gave him ...
A harvest
LAST RITES
Harrison Cooper was not that old, only thirty-nine, touching at the warm
rim of forty rather than the cold rim of thirty, which makes a great
difference in temperature and attitude. He was a genius verging on the
brilliant, unmarried, unengaged, with no children that he could honestly
claim, so having nothing much else to do, woke one morning in the summer
of 1999, weeping.
"Why!?"
Out of bed, he faced his mirror to watch the tears, examine his sadness,
trace the woe. Like a child, curious after emotion, he charted his own
map, found no capital city of despair, but only a vast and empty expanse
of sorrow, and went to shave.
Which didn't help, for Harrison Cooper had stumbled on some secret
supply of melancholy that, even as he shaved, spilled in rivulets down
his soaped cheeks.
"Great God," he cried. "I'm at a funeral, but who's dead?!"
He ate his breakfast toast somewhat soggier than usual and plunged off
to his laboratory to see if gazing at his Time Traveler would solve the
mystery of eyes that shed rain while the rest of him stood fair.
Time Traveler? All, yes.
For Harrison Cooper had spent the better part of his third decade wiring
circuitries of impossible pasts and as yet untouchable futures. Most men
philosophize in their as-beautiful-as-women cars. Harrison Cooper chose
to dream and knock together from pure air and electric thunderclaps what
he called his Mobius Machine.
He had told his friends, with wine-colored nonchalance, that he was
taking a future strip and a past strip, giving them a now half twist, so
they looped on a single plane. Like those figure-eight ribbons, cut and
pasted by that dear mathematician A. F. Mobius in the nineteenth
century.
"Ah, yes, Mobius," friends murmured.
What they really meant was, "Ah, no. Good night."
Harrison Cooper was not a mad scientist, but he was irretrievably
boring. Knowing this, he had retreated to finish the Mobius Machine.
Now, this strange morning, with cold rain streaming from his eyes, he
stood staring at the damned contraption, bewildered that he was not
dancing about with Creation's joy.
He was interrupted by the ringing of the laboratory doorbell and opened
the door to find one of those rare people, a real Western Union delivery
boy on a real bike. He signed for the telegram and was about to shut the
door when he saw the lad staring fixedly at the Mobius Machine.
"What," exclaimed the boy, eyes wide, "is that?"
Harrison Cooper stood aside and let the boy wander in a great circle
around his Machine, his eyes dancing up, over, and around the immense
circling figure eight of shining copper, brass, and silver.
"Sure!" cried the boy at last, beaming. "A Time Machine!"
''Bull's-eye!''
"When do you leave?" said the boy. "Where will you go to meet which
person where? Alexander? Caesar? Napoleon! Hitler?!"
"No, no!"
The boy exploded his list. "Lincoln-"
"More like it."
"General Grant! Roosevelt! Benjamin Franklin?"
"Franklin, yes!"
"Aren't you lucky?"
"Am I?" Stunned, Harrison Cooper found himself nodding. "Yes, by God,
and suddenly-"
Suddenly he knew why he had wept at dawn. He grabbed the young lad's
hand. "Much thanks. You're a catalyst-"
"Cat-?"
"A Rorschach test-making me draw my own list-now gently, swiftly-out! No
offense."
The door slammed. He ran for his library phone, punched numbers, waited,
scanning the thousand books on the shelves.
"Yes, yes, he murmured, his eyes flicking over the gorgeous sun-bright
titles. "Some of you. Two, three, maybe four. Hello! Sam? Samuel! Can
you get here in five minutes, make it three? Dire emergency. Come!"
He slammed the phone, swiveled to reach out and touch.
"Shakespeare," he murmured. "Willy-William, will it be-you?"
The laboratory door opened and Sam/Samuel stuck his head in and froze.
For there, seated in the midst of his great Mobius figure eight, leather
jacket and boots shined, picnic lunch packed, was Harrison Cooper, arms
flexed, elbows out, fingers alert to the computer controls.
"Where's your Lindbergh cap and goggles?" asked Samuel.
Harrison Cooper dug them out, put them on, smirking. "Raise
the Titanic; then sink it!" Samuel strode to the lovely machine to
confront its rather outre' occupant. "Well, Cooper, what?" he cried.
"I woke this morning in tears."
"Sure. I read the phone book aloud last night. That did it!"
"No. You read me these!"
Cooper handed the books over.
"Sure! We gabbed till three, drunk as owls on English Lit!''
"To give me tears for answers!"
"To what?"
"To their loss. To the fact that they died unknown, unrecognized; to the
grim fact that some were only truly recognized, republished, raved over
from 1920 on!"
"Cut the cackle and move the buns," said Samuel. "Did you call to
sermonize or ask advice?"
Harrison Cooper leaped from his machine and elbowed Samuel into the
library.
"You must map my trip for me!"
"Trip? Trip!"
"I go a-journeying, far-traveling, the Grand Literary Tour. A Salvation
Army of one!"
"To save lives?"
"No, souls! What good is life if the soul's dead? Sit! Tell me all the
authors we raved on by night to weep me at dawn. Here's brandy. Drink!
Remember?"
"I do!"
"List them, then! The New England Melancholic first. Sad, recluse from
land, should have drowned at sea, a lost soul of sixty! Now,
what other sad geniuses did we maunder over-"
"God!" Samuel cried. "You're going to tour them? Oh, Harrison, Harry, I
love you!"
"Shut up! Remember how you write jokes? Laugh and think backwards! So
let us cry and leap up our tear ducts to the source. Weep for Whales to
find minnows!"
"Last night I think I quoted-"
"Yes?"
"And then we spoke-"
"Go on-"
''Well.''
Samuel gulped his brandy. Fire burned his eyes.
"Write this down!"
They wrote and ran.
"What will you do when you get there, Librarian Doctor?"
Harrison Cooper, seated back in the shadow of the great hovering Mobius
ribbon, laughed and nodded. "Yes! Harrison Cooper, L.M.D. Literary
Meadow Doctor. Curer of fine old lions off their feed, in dire need of
tender love, small applause, the wine of words, all in my heart, all on
my tongue. Say 'Ah!' So long. Good-bye!"
"God bless!"
He slammed a lever, whirled a knob, and the machine, in a spiral of
metal, a whisk of butterfly ribbon, very simply-vanished.
A moment later, the Mobius Machine gave a twist of its atoms
and-returned.
"Voila!" cried Harrison Cooper, pink-faced and wild-eyed. 'It's done!"
"So soon?" exclaimed his friend Samuel "A minute here, but hours there!"
"Did you succeed?"
"Look! Proof positive."
For tears dripped off his chin.
"What happened? what?!"
“This, and this ... and ...this!”
A gyroscope spun, a celebratory ribbon spiraled endlessly on itself, and
the ghost of a massive window curtain haunted the air, exhaled, and then
ceased.
As if fallen from a delivery-chute, the books arrived almost before the
footfalls and then the half-seen feet and then the fog-wrapped legs and
body and at last the head of a man who, as the ribbon spiraled itself
back into emptiness, crouched over the volumes as if warming himself at
a hearth.
He touched the books and listened to the air in the dim hallway where
dinnertime voices drifted up from below and a door stood wide near his
elbow, from which the faint scent of illness came and went, arrived and
departed, with the stilted breathing of some patient within the room.
Plates and silverware sounded from the world of evening and quiet good
health downstairs. The hall and the sickroom were for a time deserted.
In a moment, someone might ascend with a tray for the half-sleeping man
in the intemperate room.
Harrison Cooper rose with stealth, checking the stairwell, and then,
carrying a sweet burden of books, moved into the room, where candles lit
both sides of a bed on which the dying man lay supine, arms straight at
his sides, head weighting the pillow, eyes grimaced shut, mouth set as
if daring the ceiling, mortality itself, to sink and extinguish him.
At the first touch of the books, now on one side, now on the other, of
his bed, the old man's eyelids fluttered, his dry lips cracked; the air
whistled from his nostrils:
"who's there?" he whispered. "what time is it?"
"whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a
damp, drizzly November in my soul, then I account it high time to get to
sea as soon as I can," replied the traveler at the foot of the bed,
quietly.
"what, what?" the old man in the bed whispered swiftly. "It is a way I
have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation," quoted
the visitor, who now moved to place a book under each of the dying man's
hands where his tremoring fingers could scratch, pull away, then touch,
Braille-like, again.
One by one, the stranger held up book after book, to show the covers,
then a page, and yet another title page where printed dates of this
novel surfed up, adrift, but to stay forever on some far future shore.
The sick man's eyes lingered over the covers, the tides, the dates, and
then fixed to his visitor's bright face. He exhaled, stunned. "My God,
you have the look of a traveler. From where?"
"Do the years show?" Harrison Cooper leaned forward. "Well, then-I bring
you an Annunciation."
"Such things come to pass only with virgins," whispered the old man. "No
virgin lies here buried under his unread books."
"I come to unbury you. I bring tidings from a far place." The sick man's
eyes moved to the books beneath his trembling hands.
"Mine?" he whispered.
The traveler nodded solemnly, but began to smile when the color in the
old man's face grew warmer arid the expression in his eyes and on his
mouth was suddenly eager.
"Is there hope. then?"
"There is!"
"I believe you." The old man took a breath and then wondered, "Why?"
"Because," said the stranger at the foot of the bed, "I love you."
"I do not know you, sir!"
"But I know you fore and aft, port to starboard, main topgallants to
gunnels, every day in your long life to here!"
"Oh, the sweet sound!" cried the old man. "Every word that you say,
every light from your eyes, is foundation-of-the-world true! How can it
be?" Tears winked from the old man's lids. "Why?"
"Because I am the truth," said the traveler. "I have come a long way to
find and say: you are not lost. Your great Beast has only drowned some
little while. In another year, lost ahead, great and glorious, plain and
simple men will gather at your grave and shout: he breeches, he rises,
he breeches, he rises! and the white shape will surface to the light,
the great terror lift into the storm and thunderous St. Elmo's fire and
you with him, each bound to each, and no way to tell where he stops and
you start or where you stop and he goes off around the world lifting a
fleet of libraries in his and your wake through nameless seas of
sub-sub-librarians and readers mobbing the docks to chart your far
journeyings, alert for your lost cries at three of a wild morn."
"Christ's wounds!" said the man in his winding-sheet bedclothes. "To the
point, man, the point! Do you speak truth!?"
"I give you my hand on it, and pledge my soul and my heart's blood." The
visitor moved to do just this, and the two men's fists fused as one.
"Take these gifts to the grave. Count these pages like a rosary in your
last hours. Tell no one where they came from. Scoffers would knock the
ritual beads from your fingers. So tell this rosary in the dark before
dawn, and the rosary is this: you will live forever. You are immortal."
"No more of this, no more! Be still."
"I can not. Hear me. Where you have passed a fire path will burn,
miraculous in the Bengal Bay, the Indian Seas, Hope's Cape, and around
the Horn, past perdition's landfall, as far as living eyes can see."
He gripped the old man's fist ever more tightly.
"I swear. In the years ahead, a million millions will crowd your grave
to sleep you well and warm your bones. Do you hear?"
"Great God, you are a proper priest to sound my Last Rites. And will I
enjoy my own funeral? I will."
His hands, freed, clung to the books at each side, as the ardent visitor
raised yet other books and intoned the dates:
"Nineteen twenty-two . . . 1930 . . . 1935 . . . 1940 . 1955... 1970.
Can you read and know what it means?"
He held the last volume close to the old man's face. The fiery eyes
moved. The old mouth creaked.
"Nineteen ninety?"
"Yours. One hundred years from tonight."
"Dear God!"
"I must go, but I would hear. Chapter One. Speak."
The old man's eyes slid and burned. He licked his lips, traced the
words, and at last whispered, beginning to weep:
"'Call me Ishmael.'
There was snow and more snow and more snow after that. In the dissolving
whiteness, the silver ribbon twirled in a massive whisper to let forth
in an exhalation of Time the journeying librarian and his book bag. As
if slicing white bread rinsed by snow, the ribbon, as the traveler
ghosted himself to flesh, sifted him through the hospital wall into a
room as white as December. There, abandoned, lay a man as pale as the
snow and the wind. Almost young, he slept with his mustaches oiled to
his lip by fever. He seemed not to know nor care that a messenger had
invaded the air near his bed. His eyes did not stir, nor did his mouth
increase the passage of breath. His hands at his sides did not open to
receive. He seemed already lost in a bomb and only his unexpected
visitor's voice caused his eyes to roll behind their shut lids.
"Are you forgotten?" a voice asked.
"Unborn," the pale man replied.
"Never remembered?"
“Only. Only in. France."
"Wrote nothing at all?"
"Not worthy."
"Feel the weight of what I place on your bed. No, don't look. Feel."
"Tombstones."
"With names, yes, but not tombstones. Not marble but paper. Dates, yes,
but the day after tomorrow and tomorrow and ten thousand after that. And
your name on each."
"It will not be."
"Is. Let me speak the names. Listen. Masque?"
"Red Death."
    "The Fall of-"                        -
    "Usher!"
    "Pit?"
    "Pendulum!"
"Tell-tale?"
"Heart! My heart. Heart!"
"Repeat: for the love of God, Montresor." "Silly."
"Repeat: Montresor, for the love of God." "For the love of God,
Montresor'."
"Do you see this label?"
"I see!"
"Read the date."
"Nineteen ninety-four. No such date."
"Again, and the name of the wine."
"Nineteen ninety-four. Amontillado. And my name!"
"Yes! Now shake your head. Make the fool’s-cap bells ring. Here's mortar
for the last brick. Quickly. I'm here to bury you alive with books. When
death comes, how will you greet him? With a shout and-?"
"Requiescat in pace?"
"Say it again."
"Requiescat in pace!"
The Time Wind roared, the room emptied. Nurses ran in, summoned by
laughter, and tried to seize the books that weighed down his joy.
"What's he saying?" someone cried.
In Paris, an hour, a day, a year, a minute later, there was a run of St.
Elmo's fire along a church steeple, a blue glow in a dark alley, a soft
tread at a street corner, a turnabout of wind like an invisible
carousel, and then footfalls up a stair to a door which opened on a
bedroom where a window looked out upon cafes filled with people and far
music, and in a bed by the window, a tall man lying, his pale face
immobile, until he heard alien breath in his room.
The shadow of a man stood over him and now leaned down so that the light
from the window revealed a face and a mouth as it inhaled and then
spoke. The single word that the mouth said was:
"Oscar?"
THE OTHER HIGHWAY
They drove into green Sunday-morning country, away from the hot aluminum
city, and watched as the sky was set free and moved over them like a
lake they had never known was there, amazingly blue and with white
breakers above them as they traveled.
Clarence Travers slowed the car and felt the cool wind move over his
face with the smell of cut grass. He reached over to grasp his wife's
hand and glanced at his son and daughter in the backseat, not fighting,
at least for this moment, as the car moved through one quiet beauty
after another in what might be a Sunday so lush and green it would never
end.
"Thank God we're doing this," said Cecelia Travers. "It's been a million
years since we got away." He felt her hand hug his and then relax
completely. "when I think of all those ladies dropping dead from the
heat at the cocktail parry this afternoon, welt"
"Well, indeed," said Clarence Travers. "Onward!"
He pressed the gas pedal and they moved faster. Their progress out of
the city had been mildly hysterical, with cars shrieking and shoving
them toward islands of wilderness praying for picnics that might not be
found. Seeing that he had put the car in the fast lane, he slowed to
gradually move himself and his family through the banshee traffic until
they were idling along at an almost reasonable fifty miles an hour. The
scents of flowers and trees that blew in the window made his move
worthwhile. He laughed at nothing at all and said:
“Sometimes, when I get this far out, I think let's just keep driving,
never go back to the damned city."
"Let's drive a hundred miles," shouted his son.
"A thousand!" cried his daughter.
"A thousand!" said Clarence Travers. "But one slow mile at a time." And
then said, softly, “Hey!”
And as suddenly as if they had dreamed it up, the lost highway came into
view. "Wonderful!" said Mr. Clarence Travers.
"What?" asked the children.
"Look!" said Clarence Travers, leaning over his wife, pointing. "That's
the Old road. The one they used a long time ago."
"That?" said his wife.
"It's awfully small," said his son.
"Well, there weren't many cars then, they didn't need much."
"It looks like a big snake," said his daughter.
"Yeah, the old roads used to twist and turn, all right. Remember?"
Cecelia Travers nodded. The car had slowed and they gazed over at that
narrow concrete strip with the green grass buckling it gently here or
there and sprays of wildflowers nestling up close to either side and the
morning sunlight coming down through the high elms and maples and oaks
that led the way toward the forest.
"I know it like the nose on my face," said Clarence Travers. "How would
you like to ride on it?"
"Oh, Clarence, now
"I mean it."
"Oh, Daddy, could we?"
"All right, we'll do it," he said decisively.
"We can't!" said Cecelia Travers. "It's probably against the law. It
can't be safe."
But before his wife could finish, he turned off the freeway and let all
the swift cars rush on while he drove, smiling at each bump, down over a
small ditch, toward the old road.
"Clarence, please! we'll be arrested!"
"For going ten miles an hour on a highway nobody uses anymore? Let's not
kick over any beehives, it's too nice a day. I'll buy you all soda pops
if you behave."
They reached the old road.
"See how simple? Now which way, kids?"
"That way, that way!"
"Easy as pie!"
And he let the car take them away on the old highway, the great
white-gray boa constrictor that lashed now slowly this way in green
moss-velvet meadows, looped over gentle hills, and lowered itself
majestically into caves of moist-smelling trees, through the odor of
cricks and spring mud and crystal water that rustled like sheets of
cellophane over small stone falls. They drove slow enough to see the
waterspiders' enigmatic etchings on quiet pools behind dams of last
October's leaves.
"Daddy, what are those?"
"What, the water-skaters? No one has ever caught one. You wait and wait
and put your hand out and bang! The spider's gone. They're the first
things in life you can't grab onto. The list gets bigger as you grow
old, so start small. Don't believe in them. They're not really there."
"It's fun thinking they are."
“You have just stated a deep philosophical truth. Now, drive on, Mr.
Travers.” And obeying his own command with good humor, he drove on.
And they came to a forest that had been like November all through the
winter and now, reluctantly, was putting out green flags to welcome the
season. Butterflies in great tosses of confetti leaped from the deeps of
the forest to ramble drunkenly on the air, their thousand torn shadows
following over grass and water.
"Let's go back now," said Cecelia Travers.
"Aw, Mom," said the son and daughter.
"Why?" said Clarence Travers. "My God, how many kids back in that damned
hot town can say they drove on a road nobody else has used in years?
Not one! Not one with a father brave enough to cross a little grass to
take the old way. Right?"
Mrs. Travers lapsed into silence.
"Right there," said Clarence Travers, "over that hill, the highway turns
left, then right, then left again, an S curve, and another S. Wait and
see."
"Left."
"Right."
"Left."
"An S curve."
The car purred.
"Another S!"
"Just like you said!"
"Look." Clarence Travers pointed. A hundred yards across the way from
them, the freeway suddenly appeared for a few yards before it vanished,
screaming behind stacks of playing-card billboards. Clarence Travers
stared fixedly at it and the grass between it and this shadowed path,
this silent place like the bottom of an old stream where tides used to
come but came no more, where the wind ran through nights making the old
sound of far traffic.
"You know something," said the wife. "That freeway over there scares
me."
"Can we drive home on this old road instead, Dad?" said the son.
"I wish we could."
"I've always been scared," said the wife, watching that other traffic
roaring by, gone before it arrived.
"We're all afraid," said Clarence Travers. "But you pay your money and
take your chance. Well?"
His wife sighed. "Damn, get back on that dreadful thing."
"Not quite yet," said Clarence Travers and drove to reach a small, very
small village, all quite unexpected, a settlement no more than a dozen
white clapboard houses mossed under giant trees, dreaming in a green
tide of water and leaf-shadow, with wind shaking the rocking chairs on
weathered porches and dogs sleeping in the cool nap of grass-carpeting
at noon, and a small general store with a dirty red gas pump out front.
They drew up there and got out and stood, unreal in the sudden lack of
motion, not quite accepting these houses lost in the wilderness.
The door to the general store squealed open and an old man stepped out,
blinked at them, and said, "Say, did you folks just come down that old
road?"
Clarence Travers avoided his wife's accusing eyes. "Yes, sir.
"No one on that road in twenty years."
"We were out for a lark," said Mr. Travers. "And found a peacock," he
added.
“A sparrow,“ said his wife.
"The freeway passed us by, a mile over there, if you want it," said the
old man. "When the new road opened, this town just died on the vine. We
got nothing here now but people like me. That is: old."
"Looks like there'd be places here to rent."
"Mister, just walk in, knock out the bats, stomp the spiders, and any
place is yours for thirty bucks a month. I own the whole town."
"Oh, we're not really interested," said Cecelia Travers.
"Didn't think you would be," said the old man. "Too far out from the
city, too far off the freeway. And that dirt road there slops over when
it rains, all muck and mud. And, heck, it's against the law to use that
path. Not that they ever patrol it." The old man snorted, shaking his
head. "And not that I'll turn you in. But it gave me a nice start just
now to see you coming down that rut. J had to give a quick look at my
calendar, by God, and make sure it wasn't 1929!"
Lord, I remember, thought Clarence Travers. This is Fox Hill. A thousand
people lived here. I was a kid, we passed through on summer nights. We
used to stop here late late, and me sleeping in the backseat in the
moonlight. My grandmother and grandfather in back with me. It's nice to
sleep in a car driving late and the road all white, watching the stars
turn as you take the curves, listening to the grown-ups' voices
underwater, remote, talking, talking, laughing, murmuring, whispering.
My father driving, so stolid. Just to be driving in the summer dark, up
along the lake to the Dunes, where the poison ivy grew out on the lonely
beach and the wind stayed all the time and never went away. And us
driving by that lonely graveyard place of sand and moonlight and poison
ivy and the waves tumbling in like dusty ash on the shore, the lake
pounding like a locomotive on the sand, coming and going. And me
crumpled down and smelling Grandmother's wind-cooled coat and the voices
comforting and blanketing me with their solidity and their
always-will-be-here sounds that would go on forever, myself always young
and us always riding on a summer night in our old Kissel with the side
flaps down. And stopping here at nine or ten for Pistachio and
Tutti-frutti ice cream that tasted, faintly, beautifully, of gasoline.
All of us licking and biting the cones and smelling the gasoline and
driving on, sleepy and snug, toward home, Green Town, thirty years ago.
He caught himself and said:
"About these houses, would it be much trouble fixing them up?" He
squinted at the old man.
"Well, yes and no, most of 'em over fifty years old, lots of dust. You
could buy one off me for ten thousand, a real bargain now, you'll admit.
If you were an artist, now, a painter, or something like that."
"I write copy in an advertising firm."
"Write stories, too, no doubt? Well, now, you get a writer out here,
quiet, no neighbors, you'd do lots of writing."
Cecelia Travers stood silently between the old man and her husband.
Clarence Travers did not look at her, but looked at the cinders around
the porch of the general store. "I imagine I could work here."
"Sure," said the old man.
"I've often thought," said Mr. Travers, "it's time we got away from the
city and took it a little easy."
"Sure," said the old man.
Mrs. Travers said nothing but searched in her purse and took out a
minor.
"Would you like some drinks?" asked Clarence Travers with exaggerated
concern. "Three Orange Crushes, make it four," he told the old man. The
old man moved inside the store, which smelled of nails and crackers and
dust.
When the old man was gone, Mr. Travers turned to his wife, and his eyes
were shining. "We've always wanted to do it! Let's!"
"Do what?" she said.
"Move out here, snap decision, why not? Why? We've promised ourselves
every year: get away from the noise, the confusion, so the kids'd have a
place to play. And . .
“Good grief" the wife cried.
The old man moved inside the store, coughing. "Ridiculous." She lowered
her voice. "We've got the apartment paid up, you've got a fine job, the
kids have school with friends, I belong to some fine clubs. And we've
just spent a bundle redecorating. We-"
"Listen," he said, as if she were really listening. " None of that's
important. Out here, we can breathe. Back in town, hell, you complain
...”
"Just to have something to complain about."
"Your clubs can't be that important."
"It's not clubs, it's friends!"
"How many would care if we dropped dead tomorrow?" he said. "If I got
hit in that traffic, how many thousand cars would run over me before one
stopped to see if I was a man or dog left in the road?"
"Your job . . ." she started to say.
"My God, ten years ago we said, in two more years we'll have enough
money to quit and write my novel! But each year we've said next year!
and next year and next year!"
"We've had fun, haven't we?"
"Sure! Subways are fun, buses are fun, martinis and drunken friends are
fun. Advertising? Yeah! But I've used all the fun there is! I want
to write about what I've seen now, and there's no better place than
this. Look at that house over there! Can't you just see me in the front
window banging the hell out of my typewriter?"
"Stop hyperventilating!"
"Hyperventilate? God, I'd jump for joy to quit. I've gone as far as I
can go. Come on, Cecelia, let's get back some of the spunk in our
marriage, take a chance!"
"The children
"We'd love it here!" said the son.
"I think," said the daughter.
"I'm not getting any younger," said Clarence Travers.
"Nor am I," she said, touching his arm. "But we can't play hopscotch
now. When the children leave, yes, we'll think about it."
"Children, hopscotch, my God, I'll take my typewriter to the grave!"
"It won't be long. We-"
The shop door squealed open again and whether the old man had been
standing in the screen shadow for the last minute, there was no telling.
It did not show in his face. He stepped out with four lukewarm bottles
of Orange Crush in his rust-spotted hands.
"Here you are," he said.
Clarence and Cecelia Travers turned to stare at him as if he were a
stranger come out to bring them drinks. They smiled and took the
bottles.
The four of them stood drinking the soda pop in the warm sunlight. The
summer wind blew through the grottoes of trees in the old, shady town.
It was like being in a great green church, a cathedral, the trees so
high that the people and cottages were lost far down below. All night
long you would imagine those trees rustling Their leaves like an ocean
on an unending shore. God, thought Clarence Travers, you could really
sleep here, the sleep of the dead and the peace-fill-of-heart.
He finished his drink and his wife half finished hers and gave it to the
children to argue over, inch by compared inch. The old man stood silent,
embarrassed by the thing he may have stirred up among them.
"Well, if you're ever out this way, drop in," he said. Clarence Travers
reached for his wallet.
"No, no!" said the old man. "It's on the house."
"Thank you, thank you very much."
"A pleasure."
They climbed back into their car.
"If you want to get to the freeway," said the old man, peering through
the front window into the cooked-upholstery smell of the car, "just take
your old dirt road back. Don't rush, or you'll break an axle."
Clarence Travers looked straight ahead at the radiator fixture on the
car front and started the motor.
"Good-bye," said the old man.
"Good-bye," the children yelled, and waved. The car moved away through
the town.
"Did you hear what the old man said?" asked the wife.
"What?"
"Did you hear him say which way to the freeway?"
"I heard."
He drove through the cool, shady town, staring at the porches and the
windows with the colored glass fringing them. If you looked from the
inside of those windows out, people had different-colored faces for each
pane you looked through. They were Chinese if you looked through one,
Indian through another, pink, green, violet, burgundy, wine, chartreuse,
the candy colors, the lemon-lime cool colors, the water colors of the
windows looking out on lawns and trees and this car slowly driving past.
"Yes, I heard him," said Clarence Travers.
They left the town behind and took the dirt road to the freeway. They
waited their chance, saw an interval between floods of cars hurtling by,
swerved out into the stream, and, at fifty miles an hour, were soon
hurtling toward the city.
"That's better," said Cecelia Travers brightly. She did not look over at
her husband. "Now I know where we are."
Billboards flashed by; a mortuary, a pie crust, a cereal, a garage, a
hotel. A hotel in the tar pits of the city, where one day is the
pitiless glare of the noon sun, thought Mr. Travers, all of the great
Erector-set buildings, like prehistoric dinosaurs, will sink down into
the bubbling tar-lava and be encased, bone by bone, for future
civilizations. And in the stomachs of the electric lizards, inside the
iron dinosaurs, the probing scientists of A.D. One Million will find the
little ivory bones, the thinly articulated skeletons of advertising
executives and clubwomen and children. Mr. Travers felt his eyes flinch,
watering. And the scientists will say, so this is what the iron cities
fed on, is it? and give the bones a kick. So this is what kept the iron
stomachs full, eh? Poor things, they never had a chance. Probably kept
by the iron monsters who needed them in order to survive, who needed
them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Aphids, in a way, aphids, kept in
a great metal cage.
"Look, Daddy, look, look, before it's too late!"
The children pointed, yelling. Cecelia Travers did not look. Only the
children saw it.
The old highway, two hundred yards away, at their left, sprang back into
sight for an instant, wandered aimlessly through field, meadow, and
stream, gentle and cool and quiet.
Mr. Travers swung his head sharply to see, but in that instant it was
gone. Billboards, trees, hills rushed it away. A thousand cars, honking,
shrieking, shouldered them, and bore Clarence and Cecelia Travers and
their captive children stunned and silent down the concourse, onward
ever onward into a city that had not seen them leave and did not look to
see them return
“Let’s see if this car will do sixty or sixty-five,” said Clarence
Travers.
It could and did.
MAKE HASTE TO LIVE: AN AFTERWORD
      When I was eight years old, in 1928, an incredible event occurred
on the back wall outside the Academy motion picture theater in Waukegan,
Illinois. An advertising broadside, some thirty feet long and twenty
feet high, dramatized Black-stone the Magician in half a dozen
miraculous poses: sawing a lady in half; tied to an Arabian cannon that
exploded, taking him with it; dancing a live handkerchief in midair;
causing a birdcage with a live canary to vanish between his fingers;
causing an elephant to . . . well, you get the idea. I must have stood
there for hours, frozen with awe. I knew then that someday I must become
a magician.
That's what happened, didn't it? I'm not a science fiction, fantasy,
magic-realism writer of fairy tales and surrealist poems. Quicker Than
the Eye may well be the best title I have ever conjured for a new
collection. I pretend to do one thing, cause you to blink, and in the
instant seize twenty bright silks out of a bottomless hat.
How does he do that? may well be asked. I really can't say. I don't
write these stories, they write me. Which causes me to live with a
boundless enthusiasm for writing and life that some misinterpret as
optimism.
Nonsense. I am merely a practitioner of optimal behavior, which means
behave yourself; listen to your Muses, get your work done, and enjoy the
sense that you just might live forever.
I don't have to wait for inspiration. It jolts me every morning. Just
before dawn, when I would prefer to sleep in, the damned stuff speaks
between my ears with my Theater of Morning voices. Yes, yes, I know,
that sounds awfully artsy, and no, no, I am notpreaching some sort of
Psychic Summons. The voices exist because I stashed them there every day
for a lifetime by reading, writing, and living. They accumulated and
began to speak soon after high school.
In other words, I do not greet each day with a glad cry but am forced
out of bed by these whispering nags, drag myself to the typewriter, and
am soon awake and alive as the notion/fancy/concept quits my ears, runs
down my elbows and out my fingers. Two hours later, a new story is done
that, all night, hid asleep behind my medulla oblongata.
That, don't you agree, is not optimism. It's behavior. Optimal.
I dare not oppose these morning voices. If I did, they would ransack my
conscience all day. Besides, I am as out of control as a car off a
cliff. What began as a numbed frenzy before breakfast, ends with elation
at noon lunch.
How did I find these metaphors? Let me count the ways:
You discover your wife is pregnant with your first child soon to be
born, so you name the embryonic presence "Sascha" and converse with this
increasingly bright fetus that evolves into a story that you love but no
one wants. So here it is.
You wonder whatever happened to Dorian Gray's portrait. Your second
thoughts grow to an outsize horror by nightfall. You upchuck this
hairball into your typewriter.
Some of these stories "happened" to me. "Quicker Than the Eye" was part
of a magic show I attended where, with dismay, I saw someone much like
myself being made a fool of onstage.
"No News, or What Killed the Dog?" was a Victrola record I played all
day every day when I was five, until the neighbors offered to break me
or the record, choose.
"That Woman on the Lawn" was first a poem that then turned into a story
about my mother as a young and needful woman; a topic we care to discuss
only with euphemisms.
"Another Fine Mess" resulted from my writing "The Laurel and Hardy Love
Affair." There had to be a sequel, because when I arrived in Ireland
forty years ago, the Irish Times announced LAUREL AND HARDY, ONE TIME
ONLY, IN PERSON! FOR THE IRISH ORPHANS. OLYMPIA THEATER, DUBLIN. I
rushed to the theater and bought the last ticket, front row center!
The curtain rose and there they were, Stan and Ollie, doing all their
old, sweet, wondrous routines. I sat with happy tears streaming down my
face. Later I went backstage and stood by their dressing room door
watching them greet friends. I didn't introduce myself. I just wanted to
warm my hands and heart. After twenty minutes of ambience bathing, I
slipped away. Thus "Another Fine Mess."
"Unterderseaboat Doktor" is an example of people not hearing themselves
talk. A writer friend at lunch some years back described his
psychiatrist, a former submarine captain in Hitler's undersea fleet.
"Holy God," I cried, "give me a pencil!" I scribbled a title and
finished the tale that night. My writer friend hated me for weeks.
"Last Rites" wrote itself because I am the greatest lover of other
writers, old or new, who ever lived. I have never been jealous of any
writer, I only wanted to write and dream like them. That makes for an
enormous list, some of them first-class ladies as well as writers first
class: Willa Cather, Jessamyn West, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora
Weelty, and, long before her current fame, Edith Wharton. "Last Rites"
shuttles in Time to pay my respects to three of my heroes, Poe,
Melville, and a third writer, nameless until the finale. It crazed me to
perceive that these giants died thinking they were to be buried unknown
and unread. I had to invent a Time Machine to celebrate them on their
deathbeds.
Some of the stories are self-evident. "At the End of the Ninth Year" is
the sort of quasi-scientific factoid we all discuss a dozen times, but
neglect to write.
"The Other Highway" lies beside the main route heading north from Los
Angeles. It has all but vanished under grass, bushes, trees, and
avalanched soil. Here and there you can still bike it for some few
hundred yards before it melts into the earth.
"Once More, Legato" spontaneously combusted one afternoon when I heard a
treeful of birds orchestrating Berlioz and then Albeniz.
If you know the history of Paris during the 1870s' Commune and
Haussmann, who tore it down and built it back to the wonder it is now,
and if you have experienced some Los Angeles earthquakes, you' could
guess the genesis of "Zaharoff/Richter Mark V." During the last High
Shake, two years ago, I thought: My God, the damn fools built the city
on the San Andreas Fault! My next thought: what if they built it that
way on purpose?!
Two hours later, the story was cooling on the windowsill.
That's not all, but it should do.
My final advice to myself; the boy magician grown old, and you?
When your dawn theater sounds to clear your sinuses:
don't delay. Jump. Those voices may be gone before you hit the shower to
align your wits.
Speed is everything. The 90-mph dash to your machine is a sure cure for
life rampant and death most real.
Make haste to live.
Oh, God, yes.
Live. And write. With great haste.
